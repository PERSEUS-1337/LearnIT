    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, in compliance with the statutory requirement. The budget documents include detailed information such as current service baseline estimates, historical data, budget authority, outlay and receipt data, analysis of specific topics, and the Administration's economic forecast. The supplemental budget documents provide extensive budget information, including current service baseline estimates, historical data, budget authority, outlay and receipt data, analysis of specific topics, and the Administration's economic forecast. It also includes descriptions of policy proposals and expectations from FY2007 through FY2012, with limited information on budget policies for FY2012 through FY2017. Additionally, the documents address long-term fiscal issues and historical data on past appropriations and outlays. The budget documents contain general and specific descriptions of the Administration's policy proposals and expectations from FY2007 through FY2012, as well as limited information on budget policies for FY2012 through FY2017. The congressional budget process begins once the Administration submits its budget to Congress, with revisions made as Congress deliberates. The congressional budget process starts when the Administration submits its budget to Congress, with revisions made as Congress deliberates. Congress adopted the FY2008 budget resolution in May 2007, followed by consideration of appropriation bills. By late July, all FY2008 appropriation bills had cleared. Congress adopted the FY2008 budget resolution in May 2007, followed by consideration of appropriation bills. By late July, all twelve regular appropriation bills for FY2008 had cleared the House and Senate Appropriation Committees. By August 5, the House had passed all twelve bills, while the Senate passed four bills but failed to pass the remaining eight by the end of FY2007. By August 5, the House had passed all twelve regular appropriations bills for FY2008, while the Senate passed four bills but failed to pass the remaining eight by the end of FY2007. The Senate later passed the Homeland Security bill in July and three others in mid-September, with the House passing a continuing resolution to fund the government until November 16. In September and October, Congress passed various appropriations bills for FY2008. The House passed a continuing resolution to fund the government until November 16, which was signed by the President. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill, providing $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority. On September 29, Congress passed a resolution (P.L. 110-92). In November, Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) which was vetoed by the President. The Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) providing $459 billion in budget authority was signed by the President. Veto threats by the President complicated the appropriations process. The defense bill included extended funding for government operations until December 14. On December 14, Congress passed another funding continuation (H.J.Res. 69). The President's veto threats complicated the appropriations process for bills in the House and Senate. The defense bill provided extended funding for government operations until December 14. Congress passed multiple funding continuations and an omnibus appropriations bill on December 19. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10 regular appropriations bills into the State-Foreign Operations bill. A fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) was also passed, funding government operations through the end of the calendar year. The President signed the omnibus measure (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The President signed a fourth continuing resolution (P.L. 110-149) funding government operations through the end of the calendar year. On December 26, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161), providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques, leading to discrepancies in projected budget paths. Estimates are subject to change with new data or economic conditions. The CBO's first budget report for FY2008 included baseline deficit estimates for FY2007 through FY2017, showing a decrease in the deficit from $172 billion in FY2007 to $98 billion in FY2008. The report projected a surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and $249 billion in FY2017, based on certain assumptions set by law. The CBO's budget report for FY2008 projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion, down from $172 billion in FY2007. It also estimated a surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and $249 billion in FY2017, based on assumptions set by law. Key assumptions include constant discretionary spending in inflation-adjusted terms and the full expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. The CBO's baseline projections assume constant discretionary spending, full expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and the lapse of the alternative minimum tax \"patch\". After 2010, receipts are projected to grow substantially. After 2010, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will fully expire as per current law, along with the lapse of the alternative minimum tax \"patch\". The assumption that these tax cuts expire and discretionary spending growth is zero explains the declining deficit and emerging surpluses over the 10-year baseline forecast. Future deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window unless major policy changes are implemented. The expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, along with zero growth in discretionary spending, explains the declining deficit and emerging surpluses over the 10-year forecast. Future deficits are projected to increase due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The CBO's report includes estimated budgetary effects of various policies, such as making the tax cuts permanent and indexing the AMT for inflation. The CBO's report includes estimated budgetary effects of policies like making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation, and increasing discretionary appropriations. These policies impact revenues and outlays, with some reducing receipts and others increasing outlays. The CBO's analysis of the President's budget proposals in March 2007 projected a smaller deficit of $226 billion for FY2008, compared to the President's estimate of $239 billion. By FY2012, the deficit was projected to be $31 billion under the President's proposals, instead of $61 billion. In 2007, CBO analyzed the President's budget proposals, forecasting higher revenues and smaller outlays. The projected FY2008 deficit was $226 billion, lower than the President's $239 billion estimate. By FY2012, the deficit was expected to be $31 billion, not the $61 billion surplus the Administration anticipated. The difference in forecasts is mainly due to medium-term projection uncertainty. For 2008-2012, CBO estimated a cumulative deficit of $790 billion based on the President's proposals, while the President's budget predicted a net deficit for the same period. The CBO's analysis of the President's budget in 2007 projected a deficit of $31 billion for FY2012, contrasting with the Administration's expected $61 billion surplus. This discrepancy was primarily due to uncertainties in medium-term projections. President Bush's FY2008 budget aimed to extend and make permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, along with other expiring tax provisions, resulting in larger revenues and outlays compared to CBO's reestimates. The President's FY2008 budget proposed extending and making permanent tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, along with other expiring provisions, leading to reduced estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012, and $1.9 trillion between FY2008 and FY2017. Additionally, the Administration's proposals would decrease mandatory spending by $96 billion. The President's proposals in the FY2008 budget would reduce estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012, and by $1.9 trillion between FY2008 and FY2017. The Administration's estimates show a reduction in mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years. Proposed policy changes include spending reductions and some increases, with a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for Social Security. The Administration's budget proposes reducing mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years, including spending reductions and some increases. The budget includes a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for personal accounts for Social Security. The proposals are expected to yield five-year savings of $59 billion and 10-year increases of $359 billion, mainly due to the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. Limited information is provided for years beyond FY2012. The Administration's budget proposes reducing mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years, including the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. Estimates suggest five-year savings of $59 billion and 10-year increases of $359 billion, with limited information provided for years beyond FY2012. The budget proposal includes estimates of revenue and spending changes for FY2008 through FY2017, with limited information provided for years beyond FY2012. The President aims to eliminate, reduce, or reform 141 programs, cutting $22 billion in budget authority for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The President proposed eliminating, reducing, or reforming about 141 programs, cutting $22 billion in budget authority for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Administration's Mid-Session Review (MSR) in July showed some deterioration in the FY2008 budget outlook since February, with a $19 billion higher deficit estimate. The Administration's Mid-Session Review (MSR) in July revealed a $19 billion increase in the FY2008 deficit estimate compared to the February outlook. The rise in the five-year deficit estimate to $651 billion was mainly attributed to rapid growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending. The FY2008 deficit estimate increased by $19 billion in the Administration's Mid-Session Review (MSR) compared to the February outlook. The rise in the five-year deficit estimate to $651 billion was mainly due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending, driven by rising health care prices and hospital patient volumes. Medicare and Medicaid spending increased due to rising health care prices and hospital patient volumes, leading to faster spending rates. The CBO estimates spending totals for discretionary appropriations legislation through a process known as \"scoring.\" Emergency spending is treated differently than nonemergency spending in budget legislation. In FY2008, appropriations totaled $932.8 billion, with $473.5 million for non-defense discretionary budget authority and $459.3 million for defense discretionary budget. Emergency spending is handled differently than nonemergency spending in budget legislation. In FY2008, appropriations legislation provided $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. The McConnell Amendment added $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate Budget Committee reported the Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) on March 16, 2007. The McConnell Amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 added $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) projected a $249 billion deficit for FY2008, $10 billion more than the President's proposal, with a projected $132 billion surplus in FY2012. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) specified expenditures and revenues for FY2008, projecting a $249 billion deficit, $10 billion more than the President's proposal. It also proposed higher levels of discretionary spending and extending expiring tax cuts, with a projected $132 billion surplus in FY2012. The Senate budget resolution proposed higher discretionary spending levels than the President, while also extending expiring tax cuts. The FY2008 totals were similar between the Senate and House versions, with the Senate amendments reducing the expected FY2012 surplus to $1 billion. The House Budget resolution was expected to result in a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus. The Senate and House budget resolutions, while similar in FY2008 totals, differed in their projections for FY2012 surplus. The Senate's amendments reduced the surplus to $1 billion, while the House expected a surplus of $153 billion. Both resolutions required offsets to extend expiring tax cuts, aiming for a balanced budget in FY2012. The House and Senate budget resolutions projected a surplus in FY2012, with the House expecting $153 billion surplus. All proposals assume a balanced budget in FY2012, based on assumptions that war costs will be minimal after FY2008. The Administration, House, and Senate assume minimal funding for military operations post FY2008 for budget scoring. They also project more middle-income taxpayers subject to AMT after FY2008, boosting tax revenues. The President's budget anticipates little growth in discretionary spending over five years. The President's budget assumes limited growth in discretionary spending over five years and projects an increase in middle-income taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) after FY2008. This will lead to a boost in tax revenues, especially after 2010 when the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are assumed to expire. The House and Senate budget resolutions assume the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire unless costs are offset through revenue gains or spending reductions, leading to a significant increase in tax revenues after 2010. Budget projections are uncertain, with measures of forecast quality including statistical unbiasedness and accuracy. Budget forecasts estimate the incremental costs of policy. Budget forecasts are uncertain due to technical factors and changes in economic conditions. Measures of forecast quality include statistical unbiasedness and accuracy. OMB and CBO have provided some measures of the accuracy and statistical unbiasedness of their forecasts in recent years. Budget forecasts are uncertain due to technical factors and changes in economic conditions. OMB and CBO have provided measures of forecast accuracy and unbiasedness. Policy changes can lead to different budget outcomes from baseline estimates. Budget projections depend on economic models and assumptions about tax and program changes. Economic conditions like growth, inflation, and spending policies also impact budget forecasts. Budget projections are influenced by economic models, assumptions about tax and program changes, and other factors like economic growth, inflation, and spending policies. Changes in economic conditions can impact budget estimates and projections. Additionally, technical components of budget models may evolve as the economy changes. Stable trends, such as population demographics, also play a role in budget estimates. Budget estimates and projections are influenced by economic models, tax policies, and factors like economic growth and spending. Stable trends, such as population demographics, impact budget estimates, while factors like future productivity growth and business cycles are harder to predict. For example, the retirement of baby boomers will lead to higher spending on Medicare and Social Security. The retirement of baby boomers will increase spending on Medicare and Social Security in the next decade. Budget estimates are influenced by factors like future productivity growth, business cycles, and financial market trends, which can be volatile. Small changes in economic conditions, such as GDP growth, can have a significant impact on budget estimates. According to CBO estimates, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth would increase the deficit by $61 billion over a five-year period. The federal budget estimates are influenced by factors like financial market trends and economic conditions. A 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years. New government policies, such as military operations in Iraq or tax cuts, also impact budget outlook. The President's FY2008 budget includes an analysis of previous forecasts accuracy and statistical bias. Forecasts become less accurate over time due to policy and economic changes.OMB analyzed why Administration's February 2005 budget estimates differed from actual results for FY2006. The FY2008 budget includes an analysis of previous forecast accuracy. OMB examined why the Administration's February 2005 budget estimates differed from actual results for FY2006. Forecasts become less accurate over time due to policy and economic changes. The standard deviation for the current fiscal year was $71 billion, while the five-years-ahead forecast had a standard deviation of $289 billion. The OMB analyzed budget estimates for the deficit, finding that five-years-ahead forecasts have a standard deviation four times larger than the current fiscal year. This leads to a significant gap between upper and lower bounds for deficit projections, making long-term forecasts imprecise. The OMB analyzed deficit projections, revealing a significant gap between upper and lower bounds due to imprecise long-term forecasts. CBO's budget estimates show the Administration's $61 billion surplus estimate for FY2012 is very imprecise. CBO provides detailed explanations for differences in projections from OMB. The Senate Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution. The CBO extensively analyzes budget estimates and includes forecast accuracy information in its publications. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution after debates and amendments. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution after debates and amendments, with a focus on additional domestic spending and accommodating the Administration's war funding request. Both resolutions aim to keep changes deficit neutral by requiring offsets to new tax cuts or mandatory spending increases. The House and Senate passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution in March and appointed conferees in early May to resolve differences. An agreement was reached on May 16, with FY2008 discretionary spending set at $954 billion. The House and Senate appointed conferees in early May to resolve differences in the FY2008 budget resolution. An agreement was reached on May 16, setting FY2008 discretionary spending at $954 billion. The FY2008 discretionary spending was set at $954 billion, exceeding the President's request by over $20 billion. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees worked on drafting the appropriations bills, with the House passing all 12 bills by the end of FY2007 and the Senate passing four. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations approved most of the 12 regular appropriations bills by mid-July. By the end of FY2007, the House had passed all 12 bills, while the Senate had passed four. The Senate passed three more bills in October, and Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills in November. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill, indicating potential vetoes for the remaining bills due to policy disagreements and spending levels. In November, Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) which the President vetoed, and the Defense bill (H.R. 3222) which the President signed. The President indicated potential vetoes for remaining appropriations bills due to policy disagreements and spending levels. Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.J. Res 52) to fund government operations until November 16, which the President signed on September 29 (P.L. 110-92). In FY2007, Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.J. Res 52) to fund government operations until November 16, which the President signed. Later, Congress approved the Defense bill (H.R. 3222) and passed another continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 69) to extend funding until December 14, which the President signed. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding for government operations until December 14. Congress passed a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 69) on December 14, followed by an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) on December 19. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10 remaining regular appropriations bills into the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. A fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) was also passed on the same day, funded government operations through the end of the calendar year, and was signed by the President two days later (P.L. 110-149). The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, $84 billion above the CBO baseline. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, $84 billion above the CBO baseline. Projections of future federal outlays have been issued by both the Administration and CBO, as well as by the House and Senate Budget Committees. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed $2,902 billion in outlays, rising to $3,246 billion in FY2012. The proposals aimed to increase funding for defense and homeland security, hold non-defense discretionary spending to a 1% annual increase, and slow the growth in some mandatory programs like Medicare. The Administration's budget proposed increasing outlays to $3,246 billion by FY2012. It aimed to boost defense and homeland security funding, limit non-defense discretionary spending growth to 1% annually, and slightly slow the growth of mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would still increase, with a $30 billion allocation for Social Security personal accounts in FY2012. If adopted, the proposals would raise outlays by $118 billion above the revised FY2007 estimate. The Administration's budget proposed increasing outlays to $3,246 billion by FY2012, with a focus on boosting defense and homeland security funding. It aimed to limit non-defense discretionary spending growth to 1% annually and slightly slow the growth of mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would still increase, with a $30 billion allocation for Social Security personal accounts in FY2012. If adopted, the proposals would raise outlays by $118 billion above the revised FY2007 estimate, leading to a 16.6% increase in total outlays between FY2007 and FY2012. The Administration's proposed budget for FY2008 includes a $150 billion increase in outlays compared to the FY2007 estimate. Most of the increase is for security activities, particularly funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there is a $8 billion increase for non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion reduction in mandatory spending. The Administration's FY2008 budget includes a $150 billion increase in outlays, with most of the funding allocated to security activities such as defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs, specifically for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is also an $8 billion increase for non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion reduction in mandatory spending. Additionally, there is a $7 billion increase in net interest payments due to increased federal borrowing. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes a $118 billion increase in outlays, with factors such as cost-of-living adjustments, population growth, policy changes, and inflation contributing to the rise. The proposals aim to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.2% in FY2007 to 20.0% in FY2008. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes a $118 billion increase in outlays, with factors such as population growth, policy changes, and inflation contributing to the rise. The proposals aim to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.2% in FY2007 to 20.0% in FY2008, with projections showing a decrease to 18.3% of GDP by FY2012. Defense spending is projected to fall by 1.1% of GDP over the same period. By FY2012, the Administration projected a decrease in outlays to 18.3% of GDP, the lowest since FY1960. Non-defense discretionary spending was expected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP, while defense spending was projected to fall by 1.1% of GDP. Mandatory programs were set to increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, while net interest was expected to decrease by 0.2% of GDP. Despite proposals to trim growth, Medicare and Medicaid were anticipated to grow slightly as percentages of GDP. The President's budget included a 6.0% increase in defense spending from FY2007 to FY2008. The Administration projected a decrease in outlays to 18.3% of GDP by FY2012, with non-defense discretionary spending expected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP and defense spending by 1.1% of GDP. Mandatory programs would increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, while net interest would fall by 0.2% of GDP. Medicare and Medicaid were expected to grow slightly as percentages of GDP despite proposals to trim their growth. The President's budget included a 6.0% increase in defense spending from FY2007 to FY2008. Defense spending is projected to decrease to $546 billion by FY2012, with non-defense discretionary spending falling from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012. The Administration's proposed levels for non-defense discretionary outlays are lower than current services estimates, with a 0.7% annual decrease. The Administration's budget proposes a decrease in non-defense discretionary spending from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012, with a substantial drop as a percentage of GDP. The plan to achieve these reductions is unspecified. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to decrease as a percentage of GDP in FY2012, reaching the lowest levels since FY1962. The President's budget includes proposals to reduce mandatory spending by $10 billion in FY2008, achieved by slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid. The President's budget proposes a 4.2% increase in mandatory spending from FY2007 to FY2008, with plans to reduce mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008. This reduction would slow the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid, aiming to cut total mandatory spending by almost $60 billion over five years. Mandatory spending is projected to grow to $1,923 billion by FY2008. The President's budget aims to reduce total mandatory spending by almost $60 billion over five years, with mandatory spending projected to grow to $1,923 billion by FY2012. Federal debt is expected to continue growing under the Administration's proposals. The budget is projected to grow to $1,923 billion in FY2012, representing 10.8% of GDP. Net interest outlays are expected to rise significantly, leading to higher debt and increased interest payments. Proposed net interest outlays exceed baseline estimates by $7.8 billion in FY2008 and would rise by almost $30 billion in FY2012 under the Administration's policy proposals. Proposed net interest outlays in FY2008 exceed baseline estimates by $7.8 billion and would rise by almost $30 billion in FY2012 under the Administration's policy proposals. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP are projected to show little change, ranging between 1.6% and 1.8% throughout the five years. CBO's baseline projections show outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. The Administration's net interest outlay estimate shows little change, ranging between 1.6% and 1.8% of GDP over five years. CBO's baseline projections indicate outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, then easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. Many analysts believe the baseline understates future growth in discretionary spending. The CBO baseline projections show federal outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, then easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. Analysts believe the baseline understates future growth in discretionary spending, with potential increases or decreases in federal outlays depending on discretionary spending levels. Defense spending is projected to increase according to CBO estimates. Federal outlays could increase by $1.55 trillion if discretionary spending grows with the economy, or decrease by $1.65 trillion if fixed at FY2007 levels. Defense spending is projected to rise from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, reaching $773 billion in FY2017 according to CBO baseline estimates. Defense spending is projected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, reaching $773 billion in FY2017 according to CBO baseline estimates. The percentage of GDP allocated to defense spending is expected to gradually decrease over the 10-year period, from 4.0% in FY2007 to 3.6% in FY2017. Alternative scenarios, such as troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, show lower spending levels. Defense spending is projected to decrease from 4.0% of GDP in FY2007 to 3.6% in FY2017. Withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan could lower spending by $1.25 trillion over FY2008-FY2017. Withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan would significantly reduce projected discretionary spending and interest costs. CBO estimates that withdrawing all but 30,000 troops by 2010 could save about $1.25 trillion over FY2008-FY2017, while withdrawing all but 75,000 troops by 2013 could save around $750 billion during the same period. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to increase steadily from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in the future. By 2013, 75,000 troops deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and related operations could save about $750 billion in projected discretionary spending and interest costs over FY2008-FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to rise to $619 billion in FY2017, falling as a percentage of GDP from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.9% in FY2017 according to CBO baseline projections. In FY2012, discretionary spending is projected to increase to $619 billion, with non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP falling from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.9% in FY2017. CBO baseline projections show a decrease in discretionary spending's relative size over time, with mandatory spending projected to increase to $1,883 billion by FY2012. The CBO projects that discretionary spending's relative size will shrink over time, while mandatory spending is expected to increase significantly. Mandatory spending is projected to reach $2,598 billion by FY2017, representing 12.1% of GDP. Mandatory spending is projected to increase to $2,598 billion by FY2017, reaching 12.1% of GDP. Net interest payments are expected to grow from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008, with projected smaller deficits in later years. This would slow the federal debt's growth and potentially lead to surpluses in FY2012 and beyond, reducing federal debt and lowering net interest payments. In 2007, net interest is projected to increase from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008, with smaller deficits in later years slowing federal debt growth. Surpluses in FY2012 and beyond would reduce federal debt, lowering net interest payments. Net interest payments peak at $292 billion in FY2012, then decrease to $278 billion in FY2017. Net interest as a share of GDP is expected to remain around 1.7% until FY2012, gradually falling to 1.3% in FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion. Projected net interest payments peak at $292 billion in FY2012, then ease back to $278 billion in FY2017. Net interest as a share of GDP is expected to hold nearly steady around 1.7% until FY2012, before gradually falling to 1.3% of GDP in FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012. The Senate Budget Committee proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution on March 23, with the House passing the resolution on March 29. The resolution included defense funding matching the President's request for FY2008, with domestic spending exceeding the Administration's proposal. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) on March 23, with the House passing the resolution on March 29. The resolution included $2,933 billion in outlays for FY2008, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The May 17, 2007, conference agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Figure 1 shows spending by category as percentages of GDP from the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review. The May 17, 2007, conference agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Figure 1 displays spending by category as percentages of GDP from the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review, showing actual outlays for defense, non-defense, mandatory, and net interest spending from FY2000 through FY2006 and the Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP are expected to decline over the five-year period FY2007-FY2012. The figure displays actual outlays for defense, non-defense, mandatory, and net interest spending from FY2000 through FY2006 and the Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP are projected to decline over the five-year period FY2007-FY2012, while mandatory spending is expected to increase. Over the FY2007-FY2012 period, defense and non-defense discretionary spending is projected to decrease relative to GDP, while mandatory spending is expected to increase. The Administration assumes non-defense discretionary spending will fall after 2007 and no additional spending will be provided for ongoing military operations after FY2008. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending would keep it stable as a share of GDP. The introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending from current service baseline levels would keep it stable as a share of GDP. The introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. Figure 2 shows four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017. The President's proposed limited reductions in mandatory spending from current service baseline levels would keep it stable as a share of GDP. Figure 2 displays four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017, including the President's FY2008 budget proposal, a revised proposal, an alternative outlook from CBO data, and the CBO reestimate of the President's original FY2008 proposals. The Administration's outlook on outlays as a percentage of GDP runs through FY2012, with proposed reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs. By FY2012, spending would be just below its level in FY2000. The Mid-Session Review shows slightly higher outlays compared to the February budget. Outlays fall sharply after FY2007 due to proposed reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs. By FY2012, spending would be just below its level in FY2000. The Mid-Session Review shows slightly higher outlays compared to the February budget. The alternative estimate in the February budget shows increased outlays above baseline projections, leading to a higher deficit and federal debt. This is mainly due to assumptions of discretionary appropriations growing with the economy and a decrease in troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan by FY2013. The alternative estimate in the February budget projects increased outlays above baseline assumptions, driven by assumptions of growing discretionary spending and a decrease in troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan by FY2013. These factors contribute to a higher deficit, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate in the February budget projects increased outlays above baseline assumptions, driven by growing discretionary spending and a decrease in troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan by FY2013. This leads to a higher deficit, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate also includes higher net interest payments and outlay effects of changes in receipts, with outlays as a percentage of GDP rising to 21.1% in FY2017. Federal receipts are projected to be influenced by economic conditions. The future path of federal receipts, as projected by the Administration and CBO, is summarized in Table 4. Forecasts of federal receipts beyond the immediate short term are imprecise due to economic conditions. Receipts have seen unexpectedly rapid growth in recent fiscal years. The recent fiscal years have seen rapid growth in federal receipts, with increases in GDP share from FY2004 to FY2006. Receipts are projected to be imprecise beyond the short term due to economic conditions. Federal receipts have seen rapid growth in recent fiscal years, increasing from 16.3% of GDP in FY2004 to 18.4% in FY2006. The OMB's MSR showed little variation in receipts as a share of GDP from FY2008 to FY2012. CBO's baseline projects receipts to reach 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 once the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. Receipts are forecasted to rise by $767 billion over the five-year period, a 30% increase. Federal receipts have shown growth, increasing from 16.3% of GDP in FY2004 to 18.7% in FY2012. The Administration's budget proposal sees receipts rising by 4.8% in FY2008 and by $767 billion over the five-year forecast. The President's proposals aim to extend and make permanent most expiring tax cuts, with receipts as a percentage of GDP fluctuating slightly before reaching 18.6% in FY2012. The President's proposals aim to extend and make permanent expiring tax cuts, reducing cumulative receipts by $374 billion between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. Receipts as a percentage of GDP are expected to fall slightly before rising to 18.6% in FY2012. The Administration's budget proposed making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, which would reduce receipts by $374 billion between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. Additionally, the budget included relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008 at a cost of $48 billion in that year. The budget proposed making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, reducing receipts by $599 billion in the first five years and $1,854 billion over 10 years. The budget included relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008 at a cost of $48 billion in that year. Receipts from the President's July 2007 Mid-Session Review by type for FY2007 through FY2012 were similar to those in the February budget documents. Corporate income taxes declined slowly and stabilized after rising through FY2006. The President's July 2007 Mid-Session Review projected estimates for FY2007 through FY2012, similar to the February budget documents. Corporate income taxes declined slowly and stabilized after rising through FY2006. Social Insurance receipts remained stable, while individual income taxes regained some lost share but remained below their FY2000 level. Individual income taxes fell from over 10% of GDP in FY2000 to 7% in FY2004, then increased slightly but remained below FY2000 levels. The Administration proposed extending relief from the alternative minimum tax for FY2007 and FY2008 to prevent more middle-class taxpayers from being affected. The Administration proposed extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008 to prevent middle-class taxpayers from being affected. The FY2008 budget estimated that temporary AMT \"fixes\" would cost $9.1 billion in FY7 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. CBO estimated that indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion a year over the next 10 years. The President's budget called for limiting the growing reach of the AMT but omitted estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix. The FY2008 budget estimated that temporary AMT \"fixes\" would cost $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. CBO estimated that indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion a year over the next 10 years. The President's budget aims to limit the growing reach of the AMT, but omitted estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix. This omission increases the Administration's post-FY2008 estimates of federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year. Total receipts in the President's budget are expected to remain near their 40-year average of 18.3% of GDP throughout the forecasted five years. The Administration's budget aims to limit the reach of the AMT but excludes estimates of the five-year cost of the fix. This omission increases federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion annually. Total receipts are expected to remain around 18.3% of GDP, while CBO's baseline revenue estimates rise to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017. The CBO's baseline revenue estimates project an increase to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017, excluding the extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Extending these tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Extending all expiring tax cuts over 10 years would reduce revenues by $870 billion in the first five years and $3,178 billion over the full 10 years. Extending tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and $570 billion over 10 years. CBO's March 2007 budget report projected slightly lower revenues than the President's budget in all but one year. CBO estimated that limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and by $570 billion over 10 years excluding additional interest costs. Differences in economic assumptions between the Administration and CBO estimates produced most of the revenue variances, particularly in the last three years. Technical components of the estimates balanced the effect of economic changes in the first two years, resulting in only small revenue changes. The President's budget differed from CBO estimates in revenue projections over five years, mainly due to economic assumptions. CBO's estimates were $479 billion lower than the President's, with projected revenues at $14,826 billion compared to CBO's $14,524 billion. The CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than the President's budget projections over five years. CBO's revised revenue baseline estimates showed slightly slower growth in receipts compared to its baseline projections. The CBO's revised revenue baseline estimates put cumulative revenues at $14,524 billion, 2% less than previous estimates. Alternative policy assumptions show slower growth in receipts, both in dollars and as shares of GDP, due to extensions of expiring tax cuts and AMT reform interacting with tax cut extensions. The alternative revenue assumptions project a decrease in receipts as a percentage of GDP to around 17.5% by FY2012, remaining at that level through FY2017. This would result in $70 billion less revenue in FY2008 compared to the baseline, with a shortfall of $389 billion in FY2012 and beyond. The alternative revenue assumptions project a decrease in receipts as a percentage of GDP to around 17.5% by FY2012, remaining at that level through FY2017. This would result in significant revenue shortfalls compared to the baseline projections. The House and Senate budget resolutions require revenue changes to be offset to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. The conference agreement allows for extending expiring tax cuts under certain conditions and offsetting revenue losses. The conference agreement allows for extending expiring tax cuts under certain conditions and offsetting revenue losses to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown in Figure 4. The level of historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP is depicted in Figure 4. Actual receipts averaged 18.3% of GDP over the FY1966-FY2006 period, with projections remaining fairly close through FY2010. CBO's revenue reestimate and the President's revenue estimates are similar through FY2012, with receipts rising slightly above 19% of GDP by FY2017. Receipts averaged 18.3% of GDP over the 41-year period FY1966-FY2006, depicted by a horizontal line. Estimates remain close through FY2010, with CBO's reestimate projecting receipts slightly above 19% of GDP by FY2017. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years, with OMB projecting slightly larger receipts than the February budget. Both OMB sets of estimates assume the extension of tax cuts. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years, with OMB projecting slightly larger receipts than the February budget. Both OMB sets of estimates assume the extension of tax cuts, with receipts rising to slightly above 19% of GDP in FY2017. The alternative projection based on CBO data shows receipts falling as a share of GDP after FY2008. The alternative projection, based on CBO data, assumes tax cuts are extended and limits the expansion of the AMT. It shows receipts falling as a share of GDP after FY2008 and remaining constant after FY2011. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt and net interest payments. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing federal debt and interest payments. The federal government runs deficits when spending exceeds receipts, leading to an increase in government debt and net interest payments. Surpluses occur when receipts exceed outlays, reducing federal debt and interest payments. The last surplus was in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. Administration and CBO projections show deficits and surpluses, with the actual FY2007 deficit at $163 billion. The federal government last ran a surplus in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate and well below the Administration's projection in the FY2008 budget. The on-budget deficit, excluding Social Security and Postal Service surpluses, was $344 billion. The President's budget proposed a $239 billion deficit for FY2008 and a small $61 billion surplus. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate and well below the Administration's projection in the FY2008 budget. The on-budget deficit, excluding Social Security and Postal Service surpluses, was $344 billion. The President's budget proposed a $239 billion deficit for FY2008 and a small $61 billion surplus in FY2012. The Administration's baseline estimates showed surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The Administration's current service baseline estimates showed surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew slightly compared to the estimates in the President's FY2008 budget. The budget is projected to reach a small surplus in FY2012. The Mid-Session Review showed minimal differences from the February budget, with the FY2007 deficit decreasing slightly and the FY2008 deficit increasing slightly. The MSR projected larger deficits in subsequent years compared to the original budget, with a small surplus expected in FY2012. The Administration emphasized the need for strict limits on discretionary spending growth and slower entitlement spending growth to achieve deficit reduction goals. The Administration projected a small surplus in FY2012, requiring limits on discretionary spending and slower growth of entitlement spending to reach deficit reduction goals. Some of the President's proposals would increase spending or reduce receipts, necessitating larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget. The federal deficit is projected to decrease through FY2011 according to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates. According to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates, the federal deficit is projected to decrease through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. The baseline assumes no fix to the expanding coverage of the AMT and the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as required by current law. The CBO projects a decrease in the federal deficit through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Assumptions for baseline projections are considered optimistic, with revenue boosted by the lack of a fix to the AMT and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010. Discretionary spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending grows with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. The CBO projects a decrease in the federal deficit through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Assumptions for baseline projections are considered optimistic, with revenue boosted by the lack of a fix to the AMT and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010. Discretionary spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending grows with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. Some alternative scenarios show a less optimistic fiscal outlook than the path of shrinking deficits and future surpluses depicted by CBO baseline projections. Some alternative scenarios project a growing deficit from FY2007 through FY2017 by substituting different policy assumptions, such as limiting the coverage of the AMT, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending at the rate of GDP growth. Under these policies, the deficit would increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 2.3% of GDP in FY2012. The deficit is projected to increase under selected alternative policies, including limiting AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending. The deficit would rise from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017 according to CBO estimates. The deficit is projected to increase under selected alternative policies, rising from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017. CBO projected larger deficits than the Administration for subsequent years, with a small deficit of 0.3% of GDP in FY2012. House and Senate budget resolutions included deficits similar to the President's budget in FY2008, with a surplus in FY2012. In FY2012, CBO projected a small deficit (0.3% of GDP), while the House and Senate budget resolutions included surpluses for the same year. The difference in surpluses between the resolutions was due to varying assumptions about future policies. The conference agreement on the budget resolution showed a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, turning into a surplus of $41 billion in FY2012. The difference in surpluses between the House and Senate budget resolutions is due to varying assumptions about future policies. The conference agreement on the budget resolution had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, becoming a surplus of $41 billion in FY2012. Figure 5 displays deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017, with data from CBO and OMB projections. The data shows surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017, with actual surpluses and deficits for FY2000 through FY2006. The President's policy proposals included additional defense spending in FY2007 and FY2008, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, a slight slowdown in Medicare and Medicaid growth, no further AMT relief after FY2008, and the creation of personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. The proposed defense budget, however, only includes minimal changes. The President's policy proposals assumed additional defense spending in FY2007 and FY2008, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, a slight slowing in Medicare and Medicaid growth, no further AMT relief after FY2008, and the creation of personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. The proposed defense budget only includes a minimal placeholder for war costs in FY2009, with no assumptions for subsequent years. Projections show a rapid decline in the deficit as a share of GDP, with a slight surplus projected for FY2012. The defense budget in FY2009 includes a minimal placeholder for war costs in Iraq and Afghanistan, with no assumptions for subsequent years. Projections show a rapid decline in the deficit as a share of GDP, with a slight surplus projected for FY2012. CBO and OMB deficit projections extend through FY2017, showing an improving federal fiscal situation. The CBO and OMB projections in Figure 5 extend through FY2017, showing an improving federal fiscal situation with projected deficits falling in proportion to the economy. However, an alternative CBO projection based on different policy assumptions depicts a steady deterioration in the federal government's fiscal conditions, with the deficit reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. Some economists argue that alternative assumptions offer a more realistic view of future fiscal trends. The alternative CBO deficit projection grows rapidly from FY2012 through FY2017, reaching 3.6% of GDP, depicting a less optimistic fiscal outlook than OMB and CBO baseline projections. OMB, CBO, and GAO agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The OMB, CBO, and GAO all agree that the current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. This leads to constantly rising deficits and a federal debt burden that spirals out of control. The aging population and rising healthcare costs are causing federal deficits and a debt burden that is spiraling out of control. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in spending, except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending for these programs is projected to increase significantly. The aging population and rising healthcare costs are causing federal deficits and a debt burden that is spiraling out of control. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, according to CBO projections, would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending for these programs is projected to reach roughly 15 percent of GDP, necessitating significant cuts in the rest of the budget to maintain overall spending close to 20% of GDP. By 2030, spending for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid is projected to reach roughly 15% of GDP. To keep overall spending close to 20% of GDP, the rest of the budget would need to be cut by more than half. The aging population and rising healthcare costs will lead to a growing demand for resources to finance federal spending for mandatory programs over the next half-century. In the next half-century, the United States will face challenges in fiscal policy due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation. The aging population and increasing healthcare costs will drive up demand for resources to fund mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Achieving fiscal stability will likely require significant cuts in spending growth and possibly higher taxes. The Administration has expressed similar concerns in the President's FY2008 budget. Attaining fiscal stability in the future will require substantial reductions in spending growth and possibly higher taxes. The current structure of major entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will place an unsustainable burden on the budget by 2050. The President's FY2008 budget highlights the unsustainable burden that major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will place on the budget by 2050. Spending on these programs is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, presenting different challenges to the federal government's long-term fiscal position. The long-term fiscal gap between Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs and revenues is a significant challenge for the federal government. Estimates show that Medicare poses a larger fiscal imbalance compared to Social Security, with sensitivity to assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Estimates of long-term fiscal imbalances for Medicare (HI, Part B, and Part D) are sensitive to assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Analysts making more optimistic assumptions about productivity growth present a better outlook for Social Security. Projections for Medicare and Medicaid spending are affected by changes in medical inflation, which can be unpredictable due to unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns. The long-term outlook for Social Security is more optimistic with assumptions about productivity growth. Spending projections for Medicare and Medicaid are sensitive to changes in medical inflation, which can be unpredictable. Unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns can impact the short-term budget outlook. The interplay of policy, demographics, and healthcare costs will largely determine the long-term budget outlook, especially with the retirement of the baby boom generation and increasing healthcare costs. The retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs will heavily impact the federal budget in the long term, potentially overwhelming other budget areas without policy changes. The increasing healthcare costs will strain the federal budget, potentially overwhelming other areas without policy changes. This could limit the government's flexibility and strain the economy's resources."
