The growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major U.S. international gateways. Between 2000 and 2005, the value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, and the number of containerized trade shipments rose from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. The value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion between 2000 and 2005, with the number of containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. Existing and potential trade agreements suggest a further increase in international trade and freight congestion. The United States, a member of the World Trade Organization, has agreed to 11 free trade agreements. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, leading to wasted time for Americans. The US is part of the World Trade Organization and has agreed to 11 free trade agreements, with negotiations ongoing for more agreements with other countries and organizations. This is expected to further increase international trade and freight congestion. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, causing Americans to waste billions of hours in traffic and spend billions of dollars on extra fuel each year. Over 200 freight bottlenecks are also leading to significant economic losses and delays in productivity annually. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, leading to billions of hours wasted in traffic and billions of dollars spent on extra fuel each year.
