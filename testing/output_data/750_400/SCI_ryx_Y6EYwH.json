A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, allowing for confidential estimation without compromising privacy. The method can be extended to provide confidence intervals and test statistics without additional privacy budget. Extensions for differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function are also provided, supported by empirical evidence from real-life clinical datasets. The proposed method offers differentially private estimation of survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without compromising privacy. It also extends to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation. Empirical evidence from real-life clinical datasets supports the utility and privacy guarantees of the method. The proposed method provides good utility and strong privacy guarantees by offering differentially private estimation of survival functions. Adversaries can reconstruct user-level data from published survival function estimates, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. The survival function is used for modeling any time to an event, such as unemployment duration in economics or time to disease recurrence in healthcare. Adversaries can reconstruct user-level data from survival function estimates, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. Our personal healthcare information is the most sensitive private attribute. The survival function is used in various domains like economics, engineering, and healthcare to estimate time to events like unemployment, machine part failure, disease recurrence, infection, or death. Healthcare information is highly sensitive and protected by law, with information leakage in this domain being a serious issue. This study focuses on estimating the survival function using Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method. Information is a sensitive private attribute protected by law, with violations carrying severe penalties. Information leakage in healthcare is a serious issue, and this study focuses on estimating the survival function using Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method, which is widely used in clinical research. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) non-parametric method is widely used in clinical research and by statistical agencies to report survival statistics. Despite its popularity, there is a lack of models providing formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation using KM. The only related work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) uses perturbation for regression modeling. There is a lack of models providing formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation using the Kaplan-Meier method. The only related work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) uses perturbation for regression modeling of discrete time to event data, limited to multivariate regression models. Generative models like differentially private generative adversarial networks have been proposed but not directly applicable for estimating survival function differentially privately. The perturbation method for regression modeling of discrete time to event data is limited to multivariate regression models and cannot estimate survival function differentially privately. Generative models like differentially private generative adversarial networks could potentially be used to generate synthetic data for survival function estimation, but they may not generalize well to small sample sizes and highly constrained dimensionalities. Generative models like GANs can generate differentially private synthetic data for survival function estimation, but they struggle with small sample sizes and constrained dimensionalities. A new method based on the KM method guarantees differentially private estimation of the survival function. Our method provides differentially private estimation of survival function, confidence intervals, and test statistics without extra privacy cost. It can also estimate competing risk cumulative incidence function. Our method extends to provide differentially private confidence intervals and test statistics for survival function comparison between multiple groups. It also offers differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees. The method is available as an R package for easy accessibility. The proposed method offers differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function in clinical research. Empirical evidence from nine datasets supports its utility and privacy guarantees. The method is available as an R package for easy adoption. The survival function is essential for modeling time to event data, such as HIV infection to AIDS timeline. It accounts for censored observations, where some patients progress while others do not during the follow-up period. This estimation is crucial for understanding the probability of not experiencing an event before a specific time. The survival function is crucial for estimating the probability of not experiencing an event before a specific time, such as HIV infection progressing to AIDS. Various parametric methods can be used to estimate the survival function, making assumptions on the distribution of survival times. The survival function can be estimated using parametric methods like exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, and log-normal distributions, or the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method. The focus of this paper is on the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which is commonly used in clinical literature for survival models. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is commonly used in clinical literature for survival models. It defines the survival function using distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time, resulting in a step function for uncensored observations.

Differential privacy provides a provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms. Differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006) provides provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms, ensuring privacy by making similar datasets behave similarly. It defines ( , \u03b4)-differential privacy for a randomized algorithm M, where neighboring datasets x and y only differ in one row. Smaller ( , \u03b4) values offer stronger privacy guarantees.

The postprocessing property is crucial for differentially private survival function estimation. The postprocessing property in differential privacy, as stated in Theorem 1, ensures that an adversary cannot increase privacy loss by acting only on the output of a differentially private algorithm. This property is central to the approach of differentially private survival function estimation. Our approach ensures that differential privacy is maintained in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. This method is immune to post-processing, as an adversary cannot increase privacy loss by acting on the output. Our method ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. It allows for estimating various statistics in a differentially private manner without using extra privacy budget. The method ensures differential privacy in estimating survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. It allows for estimating statistics in a differentially private way without using extra privacy budget. The dataset includes time points, number of subjects at risk, and number of events at each time point. The method ensures differential privacy in estimating survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method by creating a dataset with the number of events and subjects at risk for each unique time point. A noise matrix is drawn from the Laplace distribution based on the L1 sensitivity of the dataset, and added to create a differentially private version of the dataset.

A noise matrix is drawn from the Laplace distribution based on the L1 sensitivity of the dataset and added to create a differentially private version of the dataset. Algorithm 1 succinctly presents this procedure with minimal changes required to the original. The method ensures differential privacy in estimating survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method by adding noise to the dataset. Algorithm 1 presents this procedure with minimal changes required for differential privacy, making it easily implementable with no computational overhead. The proposed method ensures differential privacy in estimating survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method by adding minimal changes to the original estimation procedure. These changes come with no computational overhead and can be easily implemented using any available software package. The method provides formal privacy guarantees and can be extended for estimating other associated statistics differentially. The proposed method ensures differential privacy in estimating survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method with minimal changes to the original estimation. The method provides formal privacy guarantees and can be extended for estimating other associated statistics differentially. The L1 sensitivity of the method is two, as it only contains count variables for events and at-risk individuals at each time point. The main theorem states that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private, with a supporting Lemma establishing the global L 1 sensitivity of the method as two. The proof shows that adding or removing any single individual can change the counts by at most two. Adding Laplace noise ensures differential privacy of the method and its individual components. Theorem 2 proves Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise to ensure privacy of individual components. The survival function calculation maintains differential privacy according to the post-processing theorem. The approach can easily extend to other essential statistics. The survival function is made differentially private by the post-processing theorem. The approach can be extended to include confidence intervals and test statistics for comparing survival function distributions. When reporting survival function estimates, it is important to include confidence intervals and test statistics for group comparison. Differentially private counterparts of these are crucial for privacy guarantees. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, at discrete time-points when an event is observed. It is important to provide differentially private counterparts of both confidence intervals and test statistics for group comparison in clinical trials. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion at discrete time-points whenever an event is observed. The calculations required for obtaining these intervals are proven to be differentially private following changes made to the data in Algorithm 1. Theorem 3 states that Confidence Intervals for \u015c (t) are -differentially private, focusing on Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are proven to be differentially private following changes made to the data in Algorithm 1. Theorem 3 confirms that Confidence Intervals for \u015c (t) are -differentially private, specifically focusing on Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are made differentially private by using Algorithm 1. This ensures that the confidence intervals are also differentially private according to Greenwood's linear-point-wise intervals. The post-processing theorem allows for the use of differentially private estimates without additional privacy costs. Using Algorithm 6, differentially private confidence intervals can be calculated without additional privacy costs, allowing for hypothesis testing such as the Logrank test to compare survival function estimates between groups. Using Algorithm 6, hypothesis testing with the Logrank test can be done differentially privately, ensuring privacy while comparing survival function estimates between groups. Using Algorithm 6, the Logrank test for hypothesis testing is -differentially private, ensuring privacy in comparing survival function estimates between groups. The test statistic Z is made differentially private by replacing sensitive information with their private counterparts, making the variance V j also differentially private. After applying Algorithm 1, the variance V j is made differentially private, along with the test statistic Z, O 1j, and E 1j. The post-processing theorem ensures that no additional sensitive information is needed, allowing for outputting confidence intervals and test statistics without impacting the overall privacy budget. The test statistic Z is made differentially private by the post-processing theorem. Using Algorithm 1 allows for outputting confidence intervals and test statistics without affecting the overall privacy budget. In some cases, events like death can prevent the observation of the event of interest. Competing events, such as death, can preclude the observation of the event of interest, leading to biased estimates. Competing risk cumulative incidence is a specialized estimate used to account for competing events in clinical data, ensuring unbiased estimates. Competing events in clinical data require specialized estimates like competing risk cumulative incidence to avoid biased estimates. Using Algorithm 1, we can extend differential privacy to competing risk scenarios, ensuring -differential privacy for the cumulative incidence estimate. Using Algorithm 1, differential privacy can be extended to competing risk scenarios, ensuring that the competing risk cumulative incidence estimate is -differentially private. This method replaces quantities with their differentially private counterparts, making the cumulative incidence estimate statistically private. Replacing quantities with their differentially private counterparts ensures that statistics associated with the cumulative incidence, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, are also differentially private. This method extends to the Nelson-Aalen estimator as well. The method ensures that statistics related to cumulative incidence are differentially private, including hazard function, hazard ratios, and Nelson-Aalen estimate. Empirical evaluation was done on nine clinical datasets. The private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is evaluated on nine real-life clinical datasets. Dataset details are provided in Table 1, with further information available in the Appendix. Our proposed method evaluates the private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard on nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. Further details are provided in Table 1 and the Appendix. Comparison is made with the original \"non-private\" version to establish credibility and utility. Our approach evaluates the differentially private survival function compared to the original non-private version on nine real-life datasets. The evaluation includes extensions like confidence intervals and test statistics. Our evaluation on nine real-life datasets compares the differentially private survival function to the original non-private version. The results show that our privacy-preserving estimation closely mirrors the actual survival function, with minimal utility loss. The estimation quality decreases with higher privacy budget. The differentially private estimation of the survival function closely mirrors the actual survival function with minimal utility loss. The estimation quality decreases with increased privacy budget. The differentially private estimation of the survival function shows good utility while protecting privacy. Smaller datasets have worse utility, as seen in ovarian, Leukemia, and Gehan datasets. The utility of differentially private estimation decreases with smaller dataset sizes, as larger noise is needed for privacy protection. Moderate to medium-sized datasets show good results even in high privacy settings, with an important estimate being the median survival time and its confidence intervals. Our differentially private estimation provides good results for moderate to medium-sized datasets, even in high privacy settings. The median survival time and its confidence intervals are important estimates often reported with survival functions. Table 2 displays the results, showing high precision in estimating the median survival time, even in the high privacy regime. The results in Table 2 show high precision in estimating the median survival time, even in high privacy settings. In some cases with high survival rates, upper bounds on confidence intervals cannot be estimated and are marked as \"NA\". Precision improves with larger dataset sizes. Our differentially private estimation shows high precision in estimating survival time, even in high privacy settings. The test statistic follows a \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom, and p-values are derived accordingly. Our differentially private estimation performs similarly to the original non-noisy estimation, maintaining statistical significance levels. Two new datasets with competing risk information also yield similar results in the estimation of competing risk. The differentially private estimates do not change the statistical significance threshold. Two new datasets with competing risk information show similar results. The proposed method provides accurate estimation while protecting privacy, even at high privacy levels. Detailed results can be found in the Appendix.

Details on datasets used for evaluation are provided, including Cancer. Our proposed method offers good privacy-utility trade-off for differentially private estimation of various statistics, including confidence intervals and test statistics. Empirical evaluation on real-life datasets, such as Cancer and Gehan, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. The datasets used for evaluation include Cancer, Gehan, and Kidney. Cancer dataset involves survival data in advanced lung cancer patients, Gehan dataset is from a leukemia trial, and Kidney dataset focuses on infection recurrence in kidney patients using dialysis equipment. The dataset for Kidney involves infection recurrence times in kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment, with comparisons between males and females. Another dataset focuses on the natural history of subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, comparing males and females. Additionally, there is a dataset on a trial in acute myeloid leukemia. Time is converted into months for all datasets. The dataset includes information on the natural history of subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and a trial in acute myeloid leukemia, with time converted into months for comparisons between different treatment groups. The dataset includes survival data from various cancer trials, such as ovarian cancer, Stanford heart transplant, and lung cancer. Time is converted into months for comparisons between different treatment groups in each trial. The Stanford Heart Transplant data by Escobar & Meeker Jr (1992) compares age groups above and below the median in months. The Veteran dataset by Kalbfleisch & Prentice (2011) compares treatment arms in a lung cancer trial. Two datasets with multiple event types are used for competing risk evaluation, including a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver by Therneau & Grambsch (2013) with the event variable being receipt of a liver transplant, censor, or death. The event of interest is the transplant. In a competing risk scenario, two datasets are used for empirical evaluation. The first dataset is from a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver, where the event of interest is the receipt of a liver transplant. The second dataset includes subjects on a liver transplant waiting list from 1990-1999, with events such as receiving a transplant, dying while waiting, or being censored. The second dataset contains data on subjects on a liver transplant waiting list from 1990-1999, showing outcomes of receiving a transplant, dying while waiting, or being censored.
