    "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses the background of animal ID and traceability, the current U.S. system, and arguments for and against a national animal ID system. The report provides background on animal ID and traceability, including the development of the current U.S. system. It reviews the controversy surrounding a national animal ID system, outlines unresolved issues, and includes a brief chronology of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and international organizations involved in animal health and trade standards. The report discusses the development and controversy surrounding a national animal ID system, highlighting unresolved issues. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced a revision to achieve animal disease traceability on February 5, 2010. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in favor of a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability. This new approach allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations. The USDA has abandoned the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in favor of a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability. This new framework allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce will be required to have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. Under the new Animal Disease Traceability framework, USDA will require all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. USDA collaborated with states and tribal nations to establish this framework after abandoning the National Animal Identification System. The Secretary of Agriculture regulates interstate movement of farm-raised livestock under the Animal Health Protection Act. USDA collaborated with states and tribal nations to establish a Traceability Regulation Working Group for feedback on a proposed rule. USDA collaborated with states and tribal nations to establish a Traceability Regulation Working Group responsible for synthesizing feedback and making recommendations for a proposed rule on animal disease traceability. APHIS held forums and public meetings to gather feedback from officials and producers, leading to the release of the Animal Disease Traceability Framework in August 2010. In August 2010, USDA released two publications outlining recommendations for animal disease traceability. APHIS held public meetings to gather feedback from officials and producers on the new framework. The USDA released two publications in August 2010 on animal disease traceability, followed by public meetings held by APHIS to gather feedback. The traceability framework is still evolving, with states having the option to implement mandatory animal ID and traceability programs. The USDA's traceability framework is still developing, with states and tribal nations responsible for managing traceability programs. States may choose to have no mandatory animal ID, rely on existing systems for disease control, or develop their own detailed ID system. The within-state programs will be implemented by states and tribal nations, not the federal government. The USDA's traceability framework allows states and tribal nations to manage their own programs for disease control. States can choose to implement no mandatory animal ID, rely on existing systems, or develop a detailed ID system. Federal rules will only apply to livestock moving in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI). The federal government will not be responsible for data collection and storage, as states and tribal nations will handle this. Livestock moving in interstate commerce will need official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI). Exemptions for identification and ICVI requirements will be outlined in the rules, with acceptable official identification types defined through federal regulations. Each state and tribal nation's animal disease traceability capacity will be assessed. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal disease traceability. Performance standards will describe desired outcomes, leaving the method of achieving them to states and tribal nations. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, in collaboration with state and tribal animal health officials, will establish performance standards for animal disease traceability. Each state and tribal nation will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual cooperative agreements. No funding is designated for animal in the agriculture appropriations bill for FY2011. The method for animal disease traceability will be determined by states and tribal nations through detailed cooperative agreements with APHIS. Federal funding, if available, will be provided through annual agreements. The agriculture appropriations bill for FY2011 does not allocate funding for animal traceability, but potential funding may be considered later. Coordination between state programs for animal identification and traceability will be governed by a program for interstate animal movements. The Senate Committee on Appropriations report indicates that funding for animal traceability is not designated in the finalized bill, but could be considered later. USDA will implement a program for animal disease traceability through federal regulations, with a proposed rule expected in April 2011. The USDA will implement identification and traceability programs for animal disease through federal regulations, with a proposed rule expected in April 2011. The rule could take 12 to 15 months to be finalized after the comment period. Major outbreaks of diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and mad cow disease have resulted in the slaughter of millions of animals and significant economic losses. The USDA is planning to implement identification and traceability programs for animal diseases through federal regulations, with a proposed rule expected in April 2011. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have led to the slaughter of millions of commercial animals and caused significant economic damages, impacting domestic and international markets. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have led to the slaughter of millions of commercial animals and caused billions of dollars in economic damages. The economic harm extends beyond the farm place to disrupt markets domestically and internationally, affecting consumers. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic animal disease outbreaks like FMD events in Taiwan in 1997 or the United Kingdom in 2001. If a similar FMD outbreak were to hit the United States, the economic consequences could be staggering, possibly costing $30 billion to $100 billion. If a Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak were to hit the United States, it could cost the cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion. This was highlighted by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson during a hearing in 2009. The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s have been significant. The economic impact of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification systems. These systems vary in nature and motivation across countries, with the U.S. focusing on voluntary programs for animal health. The economic impact of animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. Programs vary from voluntary in the U.S. to mandatory in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Some major importers like Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products for market access. Some major importers like Japan and South Korea are discussing the possibility of requiring traceability on imported meat products for market access, which could impact U.S. livestock industries due to the country's significant production and export of animal products. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production and ranking third in pork production behind China and the EU. It is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry exports (after Brazil), and third in beef exports. Changes in animal health, food safety, and import standards globally can have significant economic implications for U.S. livestock industries. The United States is the top producer of beef and poultry, ranking third in pork production globally. It is the leading exporter of pork, second in poultry exports (after Brazil), and third in beef exports. U.S. exports of animal products make up a significant portion of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef in 2007 and 2008. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups. The United States is the top producer of beef and poultry, ranking third in pork production globally. It is the leading exporter of beef and pork, while also being the world's leading importer of beef. U.S. exports of animal products account for significant portions of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef in 2007 and 2008. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for tracking purposes. Animal identification involves tracking individual farm animals or groups for traceability purposes, including information on origins, genetics, and parentage. A national database combined with traceability is considered the ideal system for this purpose. A national database of animal ID combined with traceability is essential for tracking individual farm animals and their genetics. This system allows for quick response to disease outbreaks and tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. An animal ID system allows for quick response to disease outbreaks and tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Information collected includes the animal's birth details, owner information, movement history, and slaughter details. An animal ID system collects information on birth details, owner information, movement history, and slaughter details. More elaborate systems include data on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. The system allows for rapid response to health and safety concerns. The animal ID system collects information on birth details, owner information, movement history, and slaughter details. It includes data on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement for rapid response to health and safety concerns. In the United States, the focus is on animal health traceability from birth to slaughter. In the United States, animal ID focuses on animal health traceability from birth to slaughter, while other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems that track products to the retail consumer for both animal health and food safety concerns. In the United States, animal ID focuses on traceability from birth to slaughter, while other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems that track products to the retail consumer for both animal health and food safety concerns. International buyers are demanding better information on products' history, leading to the need for traceability systems that provide details on how animals were raised, product preparation, and marketing chain information. Increasingly, international buyers of U.S. animal products are demanding better information on products' history, including how animals were raised, product preparation, and marketing chain information. Traceability systems aim to meet these demands by providing details on the origin and journey of the products to the retail consumer. The development of a national animal ID and traceability system in the United States has sparked debates between proponents highlighting its benefits and critics raising concerns. The national animal ID and traceability system in the United States has proponents citing benefits such as enhancing animal health surveillance and disease eradication, while critics raise concerns about the program. Proponents argue that an animal ID and traceability system enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of dangerous animal diseases, identifying sources of outbreaks, and reducing producers' disease testing costs. The USDA proposes a national animal ID and traceability program to reduce disease testing costs and minimize economic impact of outbreaks by containing diseases through zoning or compartmentalization. This system aims to control and eradicate animal diseases at regional and national levels, limiting the spread of outbreaks and avoiding international trade restrictions. Regionalization or compartmentalization is a disease management tool that contains a disease outbreak to a specific zone, limiting economic damage and facilitating re-establishing international market access. Rapid identification and compartmentalization of a disease outbreak helps prevent the spread of harmful diseases and reduces the number of animals that would need to be destroyed or removed from marketing channels. The outbreak limits the spread of harmful diseases, reduces economic damage, and helps re-establish international market access. Farmers track individual animals for marketing opportunities like \"organic\" or \"grass-fed\" to command higher prices in certain markets. Increasing domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers by utilizing universal bar codes on processed food to manage inventories and verify products raised according to specific standards. Universal bar codes on processed food are used by processors and retailers to manage inventories and monitor consumer buying. ID and traceability help verify production methods for meat, eggs, and milk raised according to specific standards. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, provide assurance of consistent quality products for livestock and meat producers. Government-coordinated programs, such as USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, offer process verification for livestock and meat producers to assure customers of consistent quality products. The USDA's \"Process Verified\" program allows suppliers to make marketing claims about breeds and feeding practices through independent audits. Other programs also provide varying levels of traceability for domestic origin products. A traceability program, such as USDA's \"Process Verified\" program, confirms manufacturing processes through audits and allows marketing claims for livestock products. Other programs, like national organic certification and country-of-origin labeling, also offer traceability for domestic origin products. This provides a valuable management tool for producers and ensures quality products for consumers. A traceability program, such as USDA's \"Process Verified\" program, confirms manufacturing processes through audits and allows marketing claims for livestock products. It provides valuable management tools for producers and ensures quality products for consumers. Traceability includes the national organic certification program and mandatory country-of-origin labeling. It offers post-mortem information on cattle and tracks performance history of animals, increasing transparency in the supply chain. An animal ID and traceability program would provide post-mortem information on cattle, track performance history of animals, increase transparency in the supply chain, reduce liability claims, and help maintain records on animal movements and health. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns. An animal ID and traceability program would increase transparency in the supply chain, reduce liability claims, and address food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state food safety agencies to protect the food supply from threats to human health. Safety and national security concerns are addressed by federal and state food safety agencies collaborating with APHIS to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis, Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7. Tracing back products to processors and slaughter facilities is easier than determining the specific animals involved. A more rigorous traceback and animal ID system could improve food recalls and contain the spread of foodborne illnesses. Some believe that a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system would facilitate food recalls and contain the spread of foodborne illnesses, while others in the food industry disagree, citing concerns about the system's scientific basis, technical feasibility, and cost. Enhancing foreign marketing opportunities for animal products through animal disease programs and traceability systems can reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals, satisfy foreign safety requirements, and improve credibility with consumers for value-added niche markets. After the appearance of BSE in North America in 2003, USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of various countries, aiding in reassuring buyers about the health of U.S. animals and satisfying foreign safety requirements. This also helps in certifying production processes for value-added niche markets. After the 2003 BSE outbreak in North America, USDA's AMS created an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import standards of countries like Japan. This program certifies production processes for niche markets and is now a requirement for access to foreign markets. The USDA's AMS established an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import standards of countries like Japan. This program certifies production processes for niche markets and is now a requirement for access to foreign markets, enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. exports. The USDA aims to establish an internationally recognized system of traceability to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. exports of animals and animal products. A standardized national animal identification system is crucial for the United States to receive \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health, which would improve international competitiveness and support domestic price structures for all producers. The USDA aims to establish a national animal ID system to receive \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the OIE, enhancing international competitiveness and supporting domestic price structures. The system could also aid in animal welfare during natural disasters by locating at-risk populations. Opponents argue against the system. Opponents argue that a national animal ID and traceability system constitutes an invasion of privacy, as it collects personal identification information and production methods, potentially leading to the disclosure of proprietary information. The national animal ID program is criticized for invading privacy by collecting personal information and increasing costs without guaranteeing market benefits. Critics fear government authorities may not secure personal data, leading to potential public disclosure of proprietary information. Critics argue that the national animal ID program raises concerns about data security and increased costs without market benefits. A USDA-funded analysis revealed that the majority of costs would fall on the cattle sector, with uncertainties about technology requirements. The USDA-funded benefit-cost analysis of animal ID implementation in the United States found that over 90% of the annual cost would fall on the cattle sector. Technology requirements could complicate operations and exceed operators' capabilities, potentially favoring vertical integration over family farms. The implementation of a national ID program in the cattle industry is expected to heavily burden cattle producers with the cost of tagging each individual animal, unlike in the pork and poultry industries. Critics argue that this added cost would disadvantage cattle producers in both domestic and international markets, especially smaller operators who cannot spread out the expenses. The national ID program in the cattle industry will require tagging each individual animal, which critics argue will disadvantage cattle producers, especially smaller operators, in domestic and international markets. This added cost factor may erode profit margins for small farms and ranches, while large retailers and meat packers could shift compliance costs back to producers. Critics argue that the national ID program in the cattle industry disadvantages smaller producers by eroding profit margins and giving market power to large retailers. Some religious groups object to the program on apocalyptic grounds. Some producers object to the national ID program on religious grounds, believing it signals the end of the world. Others fear increased transparency may lead to higher tax liabilities. Some producers are concerned that increased transparency from a national animal ID program may raise tax liabilities, especially for those who previously underreported livestock numbers. The program has evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts. A national animal ID and traceability program has emerged from various state and national disease eradication efforts. USDA's APHIS oversees programs that include animal identification components, such as uniquely numbered brucellosis ID tags for tracking animals. The USDA's APHIS oversees programs for animal disease eradication and control, including animal identification components like uniquely numbered brucellosis ID tags. These tags were successful in eradicating brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID requirements as the program ended. Certain classes of livestock have official identification requirements before entering interstate commerce. The successful brucellosis eradication program led to a decrease in animal ID requirements as the program ended. Certain classes of livestock have official identification requirements before entering interstate commerce, such as swine for pseudorabies and sheep for scrapie. State laws and breed association rules also often require identification for animals participating in shows or races. The official disease programs for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep require official identification before entering interstate commerce. State laws and breed association rules also often require animal identification for shows or races. Various animal ID programs vary in scope and data management. U.S. animal ID limitations were highlighted after the discovery of BSE in the United States in 2003. After the discovery of BSE in the United States in 2003, U.S. animal ID limitations were noted due to difficulties in tracing cattle movements, hindering trade with some countries. In 2003, trading partners hesitated to reopen borders to U.S. beef due to difficulties in tracing cattle movements, including those of BSE-infected cows. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to address these challenges through a state-federal-industry partnership for voluntary participation in animal health programs. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, established in 2002, aimed to improve tracing of cattle movements to prevent diseases like BSE. It was a voluntary state-federal-industry partnership, but some states mandated components like premises registration. In 2010, USDA replaced NAIS with a more flexible, state-based program for livestock traceability in interstate movements. The USDA replaced the voluntary NAIS program with a state-based program for livestock traceability in interstate commerce due to criticism from the cattle sector regarding cost and implementation burdens. The USDA replaced the voluntary NAIS program with a state-based program for livestock traceability in interstate commerce, addressing criticism from the cattle sector regarding cost and implementation burdens. NAIS was intended to cover various livestock and poultry species in the United States. The NAIS system aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the United States, excluding household pets. It was a new nationwide animal ID system for animals entering commerce or interacting with animals at other premises. The NAIS system in the United States focused on identifying animals entering commerce or interacting with animals at other premises, excluding household pets. The program was voluntary, with USDA's role being to promote and provide information about it. The USDA's involvement in the NAIS program focused on popularizing the voluntary program, ensuring information availability, prioritizing implementation by species, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, and integrating disease programs. The USDA focused on popularizing the NAIS program, ensuring information availability, prioritizing implementation by species, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating disease programs, partnering with states, tribes, territories, and advancing ID technologies. USDA published reports to provide participants with pertinent information about the program. The USDA focused on popularizing the NAIS program by ensuring information availability, prioritizing implementation by species, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating disease programs, partnering with states, tribes, territories, and advancing ID technologies. USDA published reports to provide participants with pertinent information about the program, including participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. Three reports provided detailed information about the status of NAIS, how to participate in the program, including necessary technical details, and the future direction of program implementation. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability. The NAIS User Guide, first published in November 2006, offered guidance on participating in the program. The Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability outlined strategies to improve animal disease traceability by harmonizing existing animal health programs and identification techniques. The NAIS User Guide, published in November 2006, provided guidance on participating in NAIS and its benefits. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS. The User Guide, published in November 2006, offered guidance on participating in NAIS and its benefits. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document set data standards for NAIS, including formats for identification numbers and devices. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document set data standards for NAIS, including formats for premises identification numbers, animal identification numbers, and group/lot identification numbers. Utilizing these standards would ensure system effectiveness and protect commercial interests in U.S. agriculture. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards were used in NAIS to ensure system effectiveness and protect commercial interests in U.S. agriculture. The primary goal of NAIS was to enhance disease response capabilities and limit disease spread in the United States. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to protect U.S. agriculture from animal disease outbreaks by increasing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. USDA's long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem. The USDA's goal with the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was to enhance disease response capabilities, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, and maintain market access. To achieve this, rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history is crucial during disease outbreaks. Animal health officials need key information on which animals are involved and their current locations to contain outbreaks and limit commercial damage. NAIS was designed to provide animal health officials with rapid access to complete data on animal ID and movement history during disease outbreaks. It aims to facilitate quick traceback from the point of discovery of an animal disease back to its original premises and identify other animals that may have been exposed. The NAIS system was created to quickly trace back the origin of animal diseases and identify other exposed animals. It consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. The first phase involved registering the location where livestock or poultry were raised. The NAIS system, consisting of premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking, required collecting specific information such as premises identification number, entity name, contact details, location, and operational details. The USDA required states and tribes to collect specific information for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact details, location coordinates, phone numbers, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and reasons for retirement. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, remains unchanged even after a change of ownership. Multiple PINs could be assigned to a producer based on different operations. The USDA required specific information for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact details, location coordinates, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and reasons for retirement. Producers could have multiple PINs based on different operations. Premises registration was free and maintained by the USDA in a National Premises Information system. Premises registration for animal production operations was required by the USDA, with information stored in a National Premises Information Repository to protect privacy. This data would help notify producers quickly in case of disease outbreaks or health events. The USDA required premises registration for animal production operations to be stored in a National Premises Information Repository to protect privacy. This information would help notify producers quickly in case of disease outbreaks or health events, allowing officials to locate at-risk animals and take necessary actions to minimize hardships and speed up disease eradication efforts. As of September 6, 2009, only about 37% of premises (excluding horses) were registered. In an emergency, animal health officials can quickly locate at-risk animals and take precise actions to address the situation, minimize hardships, and speed disease eradication efforts. By September 6, 2009, only 37% of premises (excluding horses) were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA emphasized the need for higher participation levels to successfully implement NAIS, which involves assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups. By September 6, 2009, only 37% of premises (excluding horses) were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA emphasized the need for higher participation levels to successfully implement NAIS, which involves assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups, such as swine or poultry raised in confined lots. An animal identification number (AIN) is a unique, 15-digit number with the first three digits as the country code and the following 12 digits as the animal's unique identifying number. The Animal Identification Number (AIN) is a unique 15-digit number with the first three digits as the country code. In the United States, the first three numbers are always 840. Tags, radio frequency identification devices, and other ID devices that comply with the 15-digit AIN numbering system are often referred to as 840 devices. AIN devices for animal identification under NAIS include traditional visual ear-tags or tattoos, RFID tags, and injectable transponders. These devices can be read physically or electronically from a distance without direct line of sight. USDA does not specify a particular identification method. The USDA does not specify specific identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders for animal identification is increasing as they allow for faster and easier access to ID information. In recent years, RFID devices and injectable transponders are being used more for animal identification as they provide faster access to ID information and eliminate the need to approach animals, reducing stress and improving data quality. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if their movement poses a low disease risk. RFID and electronic transponder devices provide faster access to ID information for animals, eliminating the need to approach or restrain them, reducing stress and improving data quality. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if their movement poses a low disease risk. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises, regardless of the number of animals present, to prevent the spread of animal diseases. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises, regardless of the number of animals present, to prevent the spread of animal diseases like avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, and vesicular stomatitis. The person responsible for the animal can choose when to place the ID on the animal, with some attaching ID devices shortly after birth and others at a later time. USDA recommends registering all animal premises to prevent disease spread. Animals should have an ID attached before moving to another location. Producers can choose when to tag their animals, either shortly after birth or later. If unable to tag at current premises, tagging can be done at an auction market. USDA recommends registering all animal premises to prevent disease spread and insists on animals having an ID attached before moving to another location. Producers can choose to tag their animals shortly after birth or later. If tagging cannot be done at the current premises, it can be done at an auction market before animals are commingled with others. Producers can have their animals tagged at an auction market providing tagging services before commingling with animals from other premises. Additional identification is not needed for animals already tagged when purchased and brought into an operation. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group. Animals can be tagged at an auction market before commingling with others. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, with no need for additional individual identification. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) are used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, with a 15-character number consisting of a PIN, date of assembly, and count of groups. The GIN is self-generated by the producer and maintained in their records. The GIN is a 15-character number used for group/lot identification of animals in the production chain. It consists of a PIN, assembly date, and group count. The GIN is self-generated by the producer and linked to the animal's birthplace or premises of origin. The ID remains with the animal for its lifetime, and the protocol is tailored to different species and their management. The ID remains with the animal for its lifetime, linking each producer's livestock to the animal's birthplace. The identification protocol is tailored to different species and their management, with access to timely animal movement records for disease outbreak control. Producers can choose from NAIS-compliant animal tracking databases for this purpose. The third phase of NAIS focused on accessing timely and accurate animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during a disease outbreak. Producers could choose a NAIS-compliant animal tracking database to report animal movements, with only minimum tracing information required for participation. This information included the national premises identification number (PIN) and the animal ID number (AIN) or group ID. The NAIS required minimum, standardized tracing information for participation, including the national premises identification number (PIN), animal ID number (AIN) or group ID number (GIN), date of the event, and event type. Other animal-specific data like age, species, and sex were standardized but not necessary for participation. The NAIS required standardized tracing information for participation, including the premises identification number (PIN), animal ID number (AIN) or group ID number (GIN), date of the event, and event type. Animal-specific data like age, species, and sex were standardized but not required for participation in the voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS was a public/private partnership where industry and states would operate and maintain Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) containing animal location and movement records. The federal government would not maintain the ATDs; states and private entities would handle this responsibility. The NAIS involved a public/private partnership where industry and states would maintain Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) with animal location and movement records. The federal government would not handle the ATDs; states and private entities would. USDA would operate a portal system called the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for animal health officials to request information during disease investigations. The USDA's plan involved maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for confidentiality. The Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) allowed officials to request information during disease investigations for timely and accurate reports on animal movements. Retrieval of traceback data within 48 hours was deemed optimal for disease containment. The Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) were part of the USDA's plan for maintaining confidentiality. The system, known as ATPS, provided timely and accurate reports on animal movements during disease outbreaks. Retrieval of traceback data within 48 hours was considered optimal for disease containment, to be used in specific situations by state and federal animal health officials. The ATPS system was designed for disease containment, to be used in specific situations by state and federal animal health officials. By September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered, with varying participation across species and states. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered in the ATPS system for disease containment. Registration varied across species, with poultry and sheep at 95%, swine at 80%, goat at 60%, horse at 50%, and cattle at 18%. By September 6, 2009, 531,284 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered, representing 36.9% of the estimated 1.4 million livestock and poultry farms. According to USDA, NAIS would need 70% participation to achieve 48-hour traceback for disease containment. 531,284 animal premises were registered by September 6, 2009, representing 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the United States. To effectively respond to an animal disease outbreak, USDA's NAIS program requires a \"critical mass\" level of 70% participation from livestock and poultry farms in the United States. This participation is necessary for achieving a 48-hour traceback goal for disease containment. USDA's NAIS program requires 70% participation from livestock and poultry farms for a 48-hour traceback goal in disease containment. Dr. John Clifford suggests a participation rate as high as 90% for full benefits of the system. Some supporters criticize USDA for slow progress. The USDA's NAIS program requires 70% participation for effective traceability, but Dr. Clifford suggests a 90% participation rate for full benefits. Critics argue that USDA is moving too slowly in implementing universal animal ID. The USDA's NAIS program has faced criticism from the Government Accountability Office for slow implementation and lack of clear priorities. The 2008 NAIS Business Plan aimed to address some of these issues, but progress has been hindered by differences among producers and stakeholders. The USDA's NAIS program faced criticism for slow implementation and lack of clear priorities. The 2008 NAIS Business Plan aimed to address some issues, but progress was hindered by differences among producers and stakeholders. There was no plan to integrate NAIS into existing USDA and state animal ID requirements, and no requirement for critical data like species or age. Participation rates were too low for NAIS to be effective, prompting calls for Congress to address the issue. The USDA's NAIS program faced criticism for slow implementation and low participation rates. USDA officials and other stakeholders called for Congress to address the issue by increasing incentives or making the program mandatory. The AVMA also supported mandatory participation in NAIS. The USDA's NAIS program faced criticism for slow implementation and low participation rates. Stakeholders called for Congress to address the issue by increasing incentives or making the program mandatory. The AVMA supported mandatory participation in NAIS, along with state animal health officials and consumer advocacy groups. The USDA's NAIS program faced criticism for slow implementation and low participation rates. Stakeholders called for Congress to address the issue by increasing incentives or making the program mandatory. The National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials and the U.S. Animal Health Association approved a recommendation for mandatory animal ID for U.S. breeding cattle. Consumer advocacy groups and industry organizations like NPPC, NMPF, and AMI also supported a mandatory national system. The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), and the American Meat Institute (AMI) support a mandatory animal identification system, while some cattle industry groups, like the Rancher's-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF), oppose it. Congressional leaders like Collin Peterson and Rosa DeLauro are interested in implementing the system to prevent losses from diseases. The House Committee on Appropriations' Subcommittee on Agriculture, led by Rosa DeLauro, supports implementing NAIS as a mandatory program to prevent losses from virulent diseases. Opponents, mainly from the cattle industry including R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, fear high costs and favor continued industry concentration. Opponents, including R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, are working to block mandatory or voluntary NAIS programs due to concerns about high costs, industry concentration, and confidentiality of information. Members of Congress from cattle-producing districts share these concerns about the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture's authority in implementing NAIS. Several members of Congress and the cattle industry have raised concerns about the USDA's ability to keep NAIS information confidential. In response to these concerns, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that NAIS would remain voluntary. In August 2006, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) would remain voluntary, despite calls for it to be mandatory. Proponents argue that a mandatory program would impose costs for tags and data systems to track animals. Secretary Vilsack may have the authority to make NAIS mandatory for the U.S. livestock industry, which would incur costs for tags, data systems, and traceability. The question of who should bear these costs - industry, government, or consumers - remains unresolved. Cost estimates for a national animal traceability system vary widely, with questions arising about who should bear the expenses - industry, government, or both. USDA suggests a cost-sharing approach, but concerns exist that compliance costs may be shifted back to farms and ranches by large retailers and meat packers. The USDA proposes cost-sharing for a national animal traceability system, but concerns exist that compliance costs may be shifted to farms and ranches by large retailers and meat packers. Larger, vertically integrated operations are seen as better equipped to handle traceability costs, while smaller, independent ones may struggle to remain in business. APHIS released a study in 2009 on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS, conducted by economists at Kansas State University in collaboration with researchers from Colorado State University. The 2009 APHIS study by economists at Kansas State University, in collaboration with researchers from other universities, estimated the economic benefits and costs of implementing USDA's NAIS. Key assumptions included individual ID tagging for all cattle and various participation rates across multiple species. The report from Colorado State University, Michigan State University, and Montana State University estimated the results of adopting NAIS across multiple species with varying participation rates. Key assumptions included individual ID tagging for cattle, group ID tagging for swine (except for cull breeding animals), and uniquely group ID tagging for poultry. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) showed the annual estimated costs for implementing NAIS in the livestock industries. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated that implementing NAIS in the livestock industry would cost approximately $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. This cost increases to $304.2 million when horses are included. Costs are lower for lower participation levels and limited traceability features. The cost of implementing full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation in the livestock industry is estimated to be approximately $228 million, increasing to $304.2 million when horses are included. The majority of the costs, over 90%, are associated with the cattle sector, amounting to $5.97 per animal marketed. Identification tags and tagging cattle account for 75% of the cattle sector's annual costs. The food animal industry costs for implementing a full pre-harvest traceability system are mainly associated with the cattle sector, averaging $5.97 per animal marketed. Identification tags and tagging cattle make up 75% of the annual adoption costs, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. Other livestock sectors have lower average costs per animal: $0.059 for swine, $1.39 for sheep, and $0.0007 for poultry. The estimated tag and tagging costs for cattle producers ranged from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal, accounting for 75% of the cattle sector's annual adoption costs. Compared to other livestock sectors, the average cost per animal for cattle was $5.97, while it was $0.059 for swine, $1.39 for sheep, $0.0007 for broilers, $0.002 for turkeys, and $0.0195 for layers. The study showed that the economic benefits of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) with full participation outweighed the costs, resulting in savings for federal and state governments in disease control programs. The economic benefits of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) with full participation easily exceeded the costs. Benefits included savings in administration of disease control programs, re-establishing markets post-outbreak, expanded market access, avoidance of significant losses, and increased consumer demand. The study found that the implementation of NAIS would be more cost-effective with higher participation levels, and may not be economically viable at lower levels. Some producers are concerned about potential implications. The study found that implementing NAIS would be more cost-effective with higher participation levels and may not be economically viable at lower levels. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination after animals leave the farm, but documentation of management practices can help protect against this. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination after animals leave the farm. Documentation of management practices can help protect against this, proving where animals originated and how they were raised. There is also debate on whether producers should be protected from public scrutiny of their records under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Producers are concerned about liability for contamination after animals leave the farm and the need for documentation of management practices to prove the origin and raising of animals. There is debate on whether producers should be protected from public scrutiny of their records under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In the 110th Congress, conferees removed a provision in the omnibus 2008 farm bill that would have required USDA regulations to protect trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2419, the omnibus 2008 farm bill enacted as P.L. 110-246, removed a provision requiring USDA regulations to protect trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, while the EU mandates individual identification and traceability for all suppliers. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef, but has other specifications in place. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef, but the opposition party plans to pass a law to impose traceability requirements on imported beef. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan plans to pass laws imposing traceability requirements on imported beef, aligning them with domestic beef regulations. The DPJ's recent election victory gives them the majority needed to push through legislation, but addressing imported meat traceability may not be an immediate priority. The DPJ, after winning 308 seats in the Japanese Diet, aims to form a coalition for a two-thirds majority to pass legislation. However, addressing imported meat traceability, a concern shared with India, may not be a top priority as they focus on setting up their new administration. The need for beef traceability, especially in countries like India, is becoming increasingly important in the global beef market. The implementation of traceability systems may soon become a requirement for market access, as per the WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures enforces traceability rules to restrict market access, with traceability becoming crucial for global beef trade. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. USDA has invested $142 million since 2004 in traceability efforts. The USDA has invested $142 million in traceability efforts since 2004, with traceability requirements for imports needing to be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. Despite the significant investment, participation in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) remained low at about 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Since 2004, USDA has invested $142 million in the development of NAIS, but participation remained low at 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held listening sessions in 2009 to address concerns and slow growth in NAIS participation rates. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions in 2009 to gather feedback from livestock producers and other stakeholders regarding the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in response to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. The aim was to address slow growth in NAIS participation rates and make decisions about the future of animal ID and traceability in the United States. In 2009, Secretary Vilsack held listening sessions to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). This feedback led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010. Approximately $142 million was allocated for NAIS from FY2004 to FY2009. Secretary Vilsack's decision to abandon the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in 2010 was influenced by feedback obtained from listening sessions and written comments submitted to USDA. Approximately $142 million was allocated for NAIS from FY2004 to FY2009, with Congress expressing frustration over the slow implementation pace. This led to a directive in the FY2009 USDA appropriation to make demonstrable progress in implementing the program. In 2009, Congress expressed frustration over the slow implementation pace of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and directed APHIS to make demonstrable progress in implementing the program. Funding for NAIS was proposed to increase slightly to $14.6 million in FY2010, but on June 11, 2009, the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. In 2009, the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) from the FY2010 appropriations bill, despite proposed funding increase to $14.6 million. Subcommittee members expressed frustration with slow national sign-up for NAIS. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) from the FY2010 appropriations bill (H.R. 2997). Subcommittee members, including chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson, expressed frustration with the slow national sign-up for NAIS. The full committee's report (H.Rept. 111-181) criticized APHIS for not implementing an effective system despite receiving $142 million since FY2004. Continued investments in NAIS are deemed unwarranted until USDA provides details on how it will implement an effective ID system. The report (H.Rept. 111-181) criticized APHIS for not implementing an effective system despite receiving $142 million since FY2004. Continued investments in NAIS are deemed unwarranted until USDA provides details on how it will implement an effective ID system. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 originally provided for the entire $14.6 million proposed by the Administration, but a floor amendment (S.Amdt. 2230) passed on August 3, 2009, reducing funding. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 originally provided $14.6 million for NAIS, but a floor amendment reduced funding to $7.3 million for FY2010. The amendment restricted the use of funds to ongoing NAIS activities and rulemaking purposes. The amended bill was passed by the full Senate on August 4, 2009. House and Senate differences in NAIS funding for FY2010 were resolved. The FY2010 funding for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was reduced to $5.3 million from the original $14.6 million proposed in the Senate version of H.R. 2997. The final funding level was set in the FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. The final FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama. USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority or establishing a program were proposed but not adopted. Several bills were proposed in the 110th Congress to establish an animal ID program, including H.R. 1018, H.R. 2301, and S. 1292. H.R. 3485 would have required new traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat, poultry, and other foods. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 814 and S. 425 aimed to establish a comprehensive animal ID and meat traceability program, requiring FSIS to trace each animal and carcass to their respective premises before slaughter. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 814 and S. 425 aimed to establish a comprehensive animal ID and meat traceability program for poultry and other FDA-regulated foods. The provisions required FSIS to trace each animal to its premises before slaughter and track carcasses and meat products through processing and distribution to the consumer. The Secretary of Agriculture could mandate record-keeping for traceability purposes. The 111th Congress considered bills for a national animal ID system and meat traceability program for FDA-regulated foods. The legislation aimed to trace animals before slaughter and track products through processing and distribution to consumers. The Secretary of Agriculture could require record-keeping for traceability purposes. The 111th Congress considered legislation for a national animal ID system and meat traceability program for FDA-regulated foods, not for FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products. Hearings were held in the House to review animal identification systems. The House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry held public hearings to review the National Animal Identification System and related issues such as animal health, disease, bio-security, and agro-terrorism. The National Animal Identification System was reviewed by the House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry. The system's development dates back to the 1800s with the use of hot iron brands for animal identification in the U.S. West. In the 1940s, the USDA initiated a program to identify vaccinated cattle for brucellosis. In the 1940s, the USDA started a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis using official tags and ear tattoos. The system was successful for decades but has been phased out as brucellosis nears eradication in the United States. In the 1950s-1980s, early detection of sick animals in disease outbreaks became crucial for containment efforts. The USDA had a successful animal ID program for cattle for decades, but it has been phased out as brucellosis nears eradication in the United States. In the 1980s, the need for early detection of sick animals in disease outbreaks became crucial. The identification system was slowly developed, and in 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" was first identified in the UK. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" was first identified in the UK's cattle and dairy herds. BSE is believed to be transmitted mainly by feeding infected cattle parts back to cattle. Subsequent testing found BSE to be widespread in the UK's cattle population, resulting in the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan led to $6.9 billion in losses and the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs. A major outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands resulted in the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in economic losses. In 2001, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK led to the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle. In 2001, an outbreak of FMD in the UK led to the forced slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing an estimated $7.9 billion in losses and eradication costs. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated on an animal ID plan. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated with various organizations to draft an early version of an animal ID plan, which was further developed by a group of representatives in 2003 to create the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP). The plan called for recording the movement of individual animals or groups in a central database. In December 2003, the National Identification Development Team produced an initial draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP), calling for recording the movement of animals in a central database. APHIS was responsible for designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004. APHIS was tasked with designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection for the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP), which aimed to have all states implement an animal premises ID system by July 2004. The plan was accelerated after the first case of mad cow disease was detected in the United States in December 2003. In response to the first case of mad cow disease in the US in December 2003, USDA accelerated the implementation of a national animal ID system. Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million to APHIS for this purpose and announced the framework for the National Animal Identification System on April 27, 2004. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was accelerated after the first case of mad cow disease in the US in December 2003. Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million to APHIS for this purpose and announced the framework for NAIS on April 27, 2004. The program outlines have been periodically revised in response to industry input, with a Draft Strategic Plan issued in May 2005 for a mandatory program by January 2009. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has undergone revisions since its inception in response to industry input. The USDA issued a Draft Strategic Plan in May 2005 with timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009. In August 2005, the USDA announced Draft Program Standards with guiding principles. By April 2006, a new plan called \"Implementation Strategies\" was unveiled, setting a timeline for full implementation by 2009. The program was initially voluntary, but regulations could be considered if participation levels were insufficient. In April 2006, USDA introduced a new plan called \"Implementation Strategies\" with a timeline for full implementation by 2009. The program was voluntary, but there was a possibility of regulations if participation levels were not sufficient. In August 2006, the NAIS program was intended to transition from voluntary to mandatory, but due to concerns raised by producers, small farmers, and religious groups, it was announced to remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. In response to concerns raised by producers, small farmers, and religious groups, the NAIS program was announced to remain entirely voluntary at the federal level in August 2006. The USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" in November 2006 outlining the three-step approach of premises registration, animal ID, and animal tracking. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining the three-step approach of premises registration, animal ID, and traceability for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The guide assured livestock producers that the program would remain voluntary and protect individuals' private information. The USDA released a user guide in November 2006 outlining the three-step approach to implementing a national animal ID program. The guide assured livestock producers that the program would remain voluntary and protect individuals' private information. In December 2007, the USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and in April 2008, they released a Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability. The Business Plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and provide benchmarks for the NAIS' progress. The USDA released a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability through the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. The USDA released a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability through the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), providing benchmarks for achieving 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. One key strategy is to prioritize species, with commercial food animals in \"Tier 1\" and other livestock in Tier 2. Another objective is to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. APHIS published a proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System in January 2009 for public comment. The USDA released a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability through the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Livestock and poultry are categorized into Tier 1 and Tier 2. The goal is to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. A proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published in January 2009 for public comment. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on NAIS. The proposed rule in March 2009 established the seven-character PIN as the standard location identifier. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the NAIS. USDA's APHIS released the results of a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis in April 2009. Secretary Vilsack announced substantial revisions to the USDA's approach in February 2010. In April 2009, USDA's APHIS released a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability. The USDA announced a new approach for animal disease traceability in February 2010, replacing NAIS. States can now choose their own level of animal identification and traceability. All animals moving in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 for feedback on the Animal Disease Traceability framework. USDA will require all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 for feedback on the Animal Disease Traceability framework. APHIS released documents in August 2010 outlining the proposed rule on traceability. APHIS released two documents on August 13 describing a proposed rule on traceability and the United States' participation in international animal ID and traceability organizations and standards. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock. U.S. livestock products must meet export certification standards of importing countries. US, as a WTO member, follows international trade rules for harmonizing participation in global commerce. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock. U.S. livestock products must meet export certification standards of importing countries. As a member of the WTO, the United States agrees to abide by international trade rules for harmonizing global commerce. The CODEX alimentarius and the OIE recommend scientifically-based standards for food safety and animal health, serving as guidelines for countries developing their own standards. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures for imports to scientifically justified requirements. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures limits traceability measures for imports to scientifically justified requirements, equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established in 1963 by the FAO and WHO, sets international food safety standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established in 1963 by the FAO and WHO, develops food standards based on risk assessment for human, animal, and plant health. These standards must be equivalent to domestic industry standards and aim to protect consumer health, ensure fair trade practices, and coordinate international food standards work. The FAO and WHO collaborate to develop food standards and guidelines under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) works to improve animal health globally. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is an intergovernmental organization responsible for improving animal health worldwide through setting international standards for animal identification and traceability. The OIE is a leading international organization for animal identification and traceability, helping member countries implement systems to improve disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. In 2006, the OIE established guidelines on identification and traceability, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006, which became official standards in 2007. The guidelines include sections on general principles and guidance for system design and implementation. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006, which became official standards in 2007. In April 2008, the Director General of the OIE called for the progressive implementation of animal identification and product traceability systems worldwide. These systems would allow compartmentalization and regionalization of disease outbreaks to facilitate trade continuity for animal products. The OIE has called for the global implementation of animal identification and product traceability systems to allow compartmentalization and regionalization of disease outbreaks, facilitating trade continuity for animal products. Export certification is often required by importing countries as part of the verification process. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on compartmentalization for trade continuity of animal products. Export certification, handled by USDA's FSIS, ensures compliance with importing countries' standards. In the United States, certification for beef imports is managed by USDA's FSIS, ensuring compliance with importing countries' standards. The OIE promotes international certification standards harmonization through programs and reliance on scientific information. The OIE contributes to harmonization of international certification standards through various programs and promotion of transparency and reliance on scientific information. Many countries have adopted national animal identification systems for foreign animal ID and traceability programs. The OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines general obligations and certification procedures. Many countries, including Canada, have national animal identification systems for traceability. Canada's system is managed by the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA). The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) manages Canada's national individual identification, tracking, and trace-back system for the cattle and bison industry, with oversight from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and collaboration with Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC). The CCIA oversees Canada's cattle and bison industry with input from various sectors. The CFIA and AAFC collaborate to meet funding needs. Initially voluntary, cattle identification became mandatory in 2002, transitioning to new methods in 2003. The Canadian cattle industry transitioned from voluntary to mandatory animal identification in 2002, moving to RFID technology in 2003. All cattle leaving their farm of origin must now be tagged with a CCIA-approved RFID tag for better tag retention and data integrity. The Canadian cattle industry transitioned to mandatory RFID tagging in 2006. CCIA-approved RFID tags with transponders and antennas are required for all cattle leaving their farm of origin. Benefits of RFID include tag retention, data integrity, and future animal movement tracking capabilities. CCIA reported a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% in March 2009. Personal information associated with ear tag numbers is securely stored. The Canadian cattle industry transitioned to mandatory RFID tagging in 2006 for all cattle leaving their farm of origin. CCIA reported a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% in March 2009. Personal information associated with ear tag numbers is securely stored in the Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS). The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) securely maintains ear tag numbers in a national database accessed by authorized personnel for animal health issues. The system covers various industry and species groups like dairy, beef, bison, sheep, pork, and poultry. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs were established in 2004 and 2008. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is a whole-of-life system for livestock traceability. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is a permanent whole-of-life system that electronically identifies and tracks individual animals from birth to slaughter. It was established in the early 1960s and includes tracing systems for sheep, goats, and developing systems for pigs and alpacas. Australia implemented a National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) in the early 1960s to track animals from birth to slaughter. The system includes mandatory tracing for cattle since 2005 and for sheep and goats since 2009. Similar systems are being developed for pigs and alpacas. In the early 1960s, Australia implemented a National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory cattle identification system using Property Identification Codes (PICs) was started in 1967, which later transitioned to an electronic system with Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs) in the mid-1990s. In the mid-1990s, the visual-read-only PIC system was converted to an electronic whole-of-life individual cattle identification system using RFIDs for biosecurity, food safety, and market access. Individual identification became compulsory for EU market supply in 1998, leading to the introduction of NLIS in 1999. In 1998, individual identification became compulsory for EU market supply, leading to the introduction of NLIS in 1999. The NLIS ensured quick tracing of animals to their origin, with a 2004 audit showing 100% success rate for NLIS animals within 24 hours. By 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory identification for all cattle leaving their birth property. In 2004, the National Livestock Tracing Audit showed that all animals identified using NLIS were traced to their property of origin within 24 hours, compared to only 41% of cattle without NLIS tags. By 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, with all stock movements required to be read at points of transfer. At slaughter in Australia, each individual animal is assigned a unique ID number linked to a barcode, allowing for tracking of carcasses, hides, and byproducts. At slaughter in Australia, each animal is assigned a unique ID number linked to a barcode, allowing for tracking of carcasses, hides, and byproducts. Individual animal ID information can be linked to live animals and their products. However, unless specific agreements are made, animals are grouped into lots by harvest date and time, and individual animal information is not available. Australia's NLIS is a joint commitment between the Australian Government and state. Australia's NLIS is a joint commitment between the Australian Government and state governments, with the Federal government playing a policy coordination role and providing funding. State governments have legal jurisdiction over livestock movement and health, working with industry to develop and implement legislation. Individual animal information at slaughter is not readily available unless specific agreements are made. The Australian Government, at federal and state levels, along with the industry, work together for the national animal identification program. State governments have jurisdiction over livestock movement and health, collaborating with industry in joint committees to develop legislation. State governments also manage producer education programs and maintain a registry of PICs. The state governments collaborate with industry committees to develop legislation for the animal identification program. They also coordinate education programs and manage the registry of PICs. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS. The registry of PICs manages identification devices, establishes reading infrastructure, audits device performance, and monitors compliance with legislative requirements. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the NLIS database, protecting data from Australian FOI laws. The EU considers animal identification part of food safety programs with mandatory requirements. The NLIS data is protected from Australian FOI laws, while the EU considers animal identification crucial for food safety programs with mandatory requirements for major commercial animal species. EU rules focus on localizing and tracing animals for veterinary purposes to control infectious diseases. The EU has mandatory programs for animal identification to ensure food safety and control infectious diseases. Species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and BSE crisis. Traceability is a key goal in these systems. In response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and the BSE crisis, the EU implemented mandatory animal identification systems. By January 1, 2000, all bovine animals were required to be identified with double ear tags for reliable traceability from birth to death. The Council of the European Union mandated permanent identification of individual bovine animals for traceability from birth to death by January 1, 2000. This system includes double ear tags, maintaining registers at animal locations, cattle passports, and a national electronic database. An additional regulation on July 17, 2000, made the bovine ID and traceability system mandatory in the EU. The EU mandated permanent identification of bovine animals for traceability, including ear tags, registers, passports, and a national database. A regulation on July 17, 2000, made the system mandatory. Meat products must be labeled with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state of harvest, and facility approval numbers. EU regulations require meat products to be labeled with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state of harvest, and facility approval numbers. Mandatory food traceability has been in place since January 1, 2005, with equidae requiring passports for movement since July 1, 2000, and porcine animals needing identification since August 28, 2008. Since January 1, 2005, mandatory food traceability has been a part of EU regulations. Equidae must have passports for movement since July 1, 2000, and porcine animals require identification since August 28, 2008. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in place since December 1, 2004. The EU implemented an ID system for ovine and caprine animals in July 2005. Japan has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004, tracking animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently lacks the same traceability requirements as domestic beef, but pressure for change is growing due to food safety concerns. Imported beef in Japan is not currently held to the same traceability standards as domestically produced beef. However, there is increasing political pressure to implement such requirements. This push for traceability regulations stems from past food safety crises, such as the discovery of BSE in domestic cattle and labeling scandals. Japan began implementing animal traceability regulations in response to these issues, starting with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures in July 2002. The Japanese government implemented animal traceability regulations and food safety oversight in response to labeling scandals. The first phase began in July 2002 with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures, requiring traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 2003. The second phase included the Food Safety Basic Law passed in May 2003 and the Beef Traceability Law in June 2003, extending traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2003. The Japanese government implemented animal traceability regulations in response to labeling scandals. The Beef Traceability Law enacted in June 2003 extended traceability from farms to slaughterhouses to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumers to reference information about domestic beef. Additionally, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture announced a new Japan Agricultural Standard program for traceability certification. The Japanese government implemented animal traceability regulations in response to labeling scandals. The Beef Traceability Law extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumers to reference information about domestic beef. Japan's Ministry of Agriculture also announced a new Japan Agricultural Standard program for traceability certification of imported beef. The Japanese government implemented animal traceability regulations in response to labeling scandals, extending traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2004. To gain certification for the Beef Traceability Law, exporters must provide specific information about the imported beef, including details like date of birth, breed, and slaughter date. South Korea also has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, requiring individual identification and registration in a central database system. South Korea implemented a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) in 2009, tracking each animal from birth to consumer with details like sex, breed, and feed administered. Consumers can access animal-specific information for domestically produced beef. The Beef Traceability System (BTS) in South Korea tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing details like sex, breed, quality grade, and location. Korean consumers can access specific information including owner details, feed, medications, slaughter location, and processing details. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand does not have a fully functioning national animal ID system. In July 2009, South Korea planned to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a fully functioning national animal ID system, but efforts were made to improve traceability through the establishment of working groups in 2004 and 2006. In August 2004, the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group (AITWG) was established in New Zealand to improve animal traceability. A Governance Group (AITGG) was formed in March 2006 to oversee the development of the NAIT system. As of early 2009, NAIT is still in development and does not function as a complete system. New Zealand currently has partial traceability systems at herd levels but lacks effective traceability for individual animals. The NAIT system is being developed to improve animal traceability in New Zealand, focusing on cattle and deer populations. Current partial systems lack effective traceability for individual animals and leave coverage gaps at the national level. Expansion to other species will be considered later. The NAIT system in New Zealand aims to enhance animal traceability for cattle and deer populations. Current partial systems lack individual animal traceability and have coverage gaps at the national level. Expansion to other species will be considered once the system is established for cattle and deer. New Zealand's existing animal ID systems for cattle and deer include MINDA and NBTIP. MINDA is a voluntary herd management system with high dairy herd participation, but lacks animal traceability. NBTIP is a mandatory system for identifying cattle and deer before movement from their property of origin. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011, dependent on confirmation of radio frequency performance. Several traceability databases are available for producers, including a new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer by June 2011. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) in 2001, now known as ERAS, as a farm-level identification system for cattle. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) in 2001, now renamed ERAS, as a farm-level identification system for cattle. Initially intended as mandatory, SISBOV remains voluntary due to lack of demand for origination information in Brazil's domestic market. SISBOV, now ERAS, was initially a mandatory program for cattle identification in Brazil but remains voluntary due to lack of domestic demand. It focuses on providing origination information for slaughterhouses supplying foreign markets like the EU, which has strict traceability criteria for imported animal products. The EU, Brazil's largest beef export market, requires strict identification and traceability criteria for imported animal products. SISBOV, now ERAS, focuses on providing origination information for slaughterhouses supplying foreign markets like the EU. However, audits by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office have found severe shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification and traceability system. The EU has strict requirements for animal identification and traceability in Brazil's beef export market. Despite the SISBOV system focusing on providing origin information for slaughterhouses, audits by the EU have revealed significant deficiencies. In 2008, a near-total ban on Brazilian beef imports was imposed, with concerns about inadequate information and the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. In 2008, the EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil due to concerns about inadequate information and the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. Argentina established a limited mandatory system of animal identification and traceability for animal products destined for the EU in 2003. Argentina implemented a limited mandatory animal identification and traceability system in 2003, known as the Argentine Animal Health Information System (SGS), aimed at animal products for the EU. The system includes farm-of-origin details and permits documenting cattle movements, particularly focusing on areas exposed to foot-and-mouth disease. Official ID tagging for all calves born after September 2007 became compulsory. Argentina's animal identification system, implemented in 2003, focuses on cattle movements and tracking for disease control. Official ID tagging for calves born after September 2007 is compulsory, with plans to tag the entire beef herd by 2017. Argentina's beef exports to the United States have been restricted due to disease control issues, particularly foot and mouth disease outbreaks. The compulsory cattle identification program in Argentina aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, with plans to tag the entire beef herd by 2017. Due to disease control issues, particularly foot and mouth disease outbreaks, Argentina's beef exports to the United States have been restricted to thermo-processed beef. This has incentivized Argentina to improve its animal identification and traceability system. Uruguay heavily relies on external markets for selling a large portion of its annual domestic production. Argentina is improving its animal identification and traceability system due to export restrictions on beef to the United States. Uruguay heavily depends on foreign markets for selling its beef production, with 68% being sold abroad during 2004-2008. Uruguay has recently implemented a comprehensive national program for animal identification and traceability. Uruguay's annual beef production heavily relies on foreign markets, with 68% being sold abroad during 2004-2008. To meet the demands of foreign buyers, Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in late 2006. Under SNIG, all animals must be tagged before six months of age or before being transported from their birth property. Uruguay's Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries implemented the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006. All cattle must be tagged before six months of age with two tags - one visible and one electronic. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010. The Uruguayan government requires all cattle to be tagged with two tags - one visible and one electronic, along with accompanying paperwork tracking them from birth to slaughter. By 2010, all herds are expected to be registered and tagged. Traceability will be extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. The Uruguayan government mandates traceability for all cattle, requiring them to be tagged with two tags and tracked from birth to slaughter. The SNIG system extends traceability to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin, with movement notification handled by registered individuals or companies. The database includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data, with further traceability to consumers being considered. The SNIG system in Uruguay mandates traceability for cattle, requiring two tags for each animal from birth to slaughter. Movement notification is handled by registered individuals or companies, with termination records recorded by MAGyP. The database includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently covers the cost of ID tags but plans to shift this expense to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs. The Uruguayan government currently pays for ID tags for cattle, but plans to shift the cost to producers in the future. Countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs due to reasons such as large agrarian populations, lack of technological advancement, and reliance on local production and marketing processes. In countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia, animal ID programs do not exist due to reasons such as large agrarian populations, lack of technological advancement, and reliance on local production and marketing processes. Additionally, lower-income consumers in these countries are not willing to pay a premium for identified and traceable food products."
