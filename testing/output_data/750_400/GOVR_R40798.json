The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed individuals in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older. It is calculated by dividing the number of people actively searching for work by the total labor force. The unemployment rate may fluctuate based on changes in both the number of jobless individuals and the size of the labor force. The unemployment rate can fluctuate based on changes in the number of jobless individuals and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the size of the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop searching for jobs, while it may increase if people believe the economy is improving and start looking for work again. During a recession, the unemployment rate can rise even when the economy shows signs of improvement, as discouraged workers reenter the labor force. This phenomenon is known as a lagging economic indicator, where the unemployment rate may continue to increase after a recession ends. Firms are cautious about hiring until they are confident in the economic recovery. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator, rising even when the economy is improving as discouraged workers reenter the labor force. Firms are hesitant to hire until they are certain of sustained economic growth. Employers are reluctant to add workers until they are convinced of sustained economic growth. They may increase production by restoring hours and having employees work overtime instead of hiring new workers. Job growth may not happen immediately when the economy shows signs of improvement. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for job data. Employers may increase production by having employees work overtime instead of hiring new workers or recalling laid off workers, delaying job growth when the economy improves. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for accurate job data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys nonfarm employers monthly to gather payroll job data, which is considered more accurate than household surveys for employment information. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses GDP and employment trends from these surveys to determine recession periods. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with the most recent one occurring from December 2007 to June 2009. The Business Cycle Dating Committee relies on changes in national output (GDP) and employment trends to determine recessions. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates typically continued to rise even after recessions ended. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates typically continued to rise even after recessions ended, peaking at different points in the business cycle. During 10 recessions since World War II, U.S. unemployment rates peaked at different points in the business cycle, reaching 7.9% in October 1949, 7.8% in July 1980, and 10.8% in November 1982. In some cases, the rate continued to climb for a few months into the economic recovery, while in others, it peaked well into the recovery period. The unemployment rate peaked at different points in the business cycle during 10 recessions since World War II. In some instances, it continued to rise for several months after the recession ended, indicating no steady job growth until later. Job growth did not sustain until after the end of all 10 recessions. During 10 recessions since World War II, the unemployment rate peaked at different points in the business cycle. Job growth did not sustain until after the end of all recessions, with a sustained period of job growth failing to ensue until after the end of each recession. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries. During 10 recessions since World War II, job growth did not sustain until after the end of all recessions. In only one instance, immediate employment level increase was seen. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries, but in other cases, it took longer for steady job growth to begin. The delayed improvement in the labor market following the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to jobless recoveries, with employment failing to show consistent improvement for well over a year. Many observers believe the nation is experiencing another jobless recovery. The economy's rebounds after recessions have been labeled as jobless recoveries due to the lack of consistent improvement in employment. While private sector job growth started to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments have slowed overall job growth."
