    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 were reported by the Senate Finance Committee and approved by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources in March 2005. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, is part of the government's social safety net. It is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975 under Title IV of the Social Security Act, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is funded by general revenues and operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services at no cost. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program operates in all 50 states and is funded by federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Child support collected on behalf of TANF families reimburses state and federal governments. Other families must apply for CSE services and may be charged an application fee not exceeding $25. Support collected for nonwelfare families goes directly to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased from $1 billion to $21.2 billion. The number of children with established paternity also rose significantly. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations and payments for 50% of its caseload. The child support enforcement (CSE) program saw a significant increase in payments from $1 billion in FY1978 to $21.2 billion in FY2003. The number of children with established paternity also rose by 1,274%, from 111,000 to 1.525 million. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations and payments for 50% of its caseload. In FY2003, paternity was established for 77% of children on the CSE caseload without legally identified fathers. The CSE program handles 50% of all child support cases and provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, and collection of support payments. The CSE program offers seven key services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, child support order establishment, support order review and modification, support payment collection and distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods involve various strategies like income withholding, tax refund interception, and reporting to credit bureaus. Jurisdictions also have contempt-of-court procedures for enforcement. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support their children. Collection methods used by CSE agencies include income withholding, tax refund interception, and reporting to credit bureaus. All jurisdictions have contempt-of-court procedures for enforcement. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States were required to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 mandated states to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and seizing assets of noncustodial parents. States were also required to have the authority to withhold licenses of individuals who owe child support. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 mandated states to implement procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages, including seizing assets and withholding licenses of individuals who owe child support. It also required states to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize the financial resources of debtor noncustodial parents. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 mandated states to secure assets for child support arrearages by seizing assets and withholding licenses of individuals who owe child support. It also required states to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize the financial resources of debtor noncustodial parents. Additionally, P.L. 104-193 authorized the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents and required states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to clarify jurisdiction in cases involving multiple child support orders. P.L. 104-193 authorized the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents and required states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). The federal government reimburses states for administering their Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program and pays for laboratory costs of establishing paternity. Additionally, states receive incentive payments to operate effective programs. The federal government reimburses states for administering their Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program and pays for laboratory costs of establishing paternity. It also provides incentive payments to encourage effective programs. P.L. 105-200 established a new cost-neutral incentive payment system with a statutory limit of $446 million for FY2005. The CSE program has evolved into a multifaceted program over the years. The CSE program, established by P.L. 105-200, has a cost-neutral incentive payment system with a $446 million limit for FY2005. It focuses on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents. The CSE program focuses on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average. Child support payments are crucial for single-parent families, making up 17% of family income on average and 30% for poor families. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the CSE program to boost collections and support economic independence for former welfare families and all single-parent families with a noncustodial parent. Child support constitutes about 30% of family income for poor families. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the CSE program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and single-parent families with a noncustodial parent. Both bills share objectives of simplifying CSE rules and enforcing \"family-first\" policies, but differ in their approaches and enforcement tools. Both bills, S. 667 and H.R. 240, aim to simplify CSE assignment and distribution rules, strengthen \"family-first\" policies, and improve enforcement tools. The Senate Finance Committee bill includes a larger list of CSE provisions compared to the House Subcommittee bill. For a detailed description of all CSE provisions in both bills, refer to Table 1 in the report. The report discusses the differences in CSE provisions between S.667 and H.R. 240, highlighting the assignment rules for TANF benefits and child support payments. The report compares the assignment rules for TANF benefits and child support payments, detailing how families must assign their child support rights to the state to receive TANF benefits. Assigned child support collections are kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement for welfare benefits. Nonwelfare families applying for CSE services do not assign their child support rights. Child support accrued while receiving TANF benefits and before starting TANF is kept by states and the federal government. Nonwelfare families keep all child support collected on their behalf. The date of assignment determines the treatment of arrearages. The assignment date determines how child support arrearages are treated: if assigned before September 30, 1997, all arrearages are permanently assigned to the state; if assigned after October 1, 1997, only arrearages accumulated during assistance are permanently assigned. Pre-assistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and revert back to the family when they leave TANF. Under S. 667 as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, child support arrearages accrued before the family started receiving TANF benefits would not be covered by the assignment. Only arrearages that accumulate while the family receives TANF benefits are permanently assigned to the state. The child support assignment under S. 667 as reported by the Senate Finance Committee would only cover child support that accrues while the family receives TANF benefits. This means that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving TANF benefits would not have to be assigned to the state, and any child support collected for pre-assistance arrearages would go to the family. In contrast, H.R. 240 as approved by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources does not make any changes regarding the child support assignment. The child support assignment rules under S. 667 do not cover arrearages accrued before TANF benefits, ensuring any collections go to the family. H.R. 240 does not alter these rules, but distribution rules determine the order of payment for child support collections. The distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, prioritizing current support and assigned arrearages collected during TANF benefits. The 1996 welfare law does not change the child support assignment rules. The 1996 welfare law allows states to decide how much of the child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family, and whether to treat child support payments as income. States also have discretion over their share of child support. The 1996 welfare law (P.L. 104-193) repealed the $50 required pass through and gave states the choice to decide how much of the state share of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family. States also decide whether to treat child support payments as income. States are required to pay the federal government's share of child support collections collected on behalf of TANF families. As of August 2004, 18 states continued the $50 pass-through and disregard policy for child support collections collected on behalf of TANF families. Both bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing more child support to families, known as a \"family-first\" policy, by offering federal cost-sharing incentives. Both bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing more child support to families, known as a \"family-first\" policy, by offering federal cost-sharing incentives. The approaches of the bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing provided and whether to help states pay for their current CSE pass-through and disregard policies or to encourage states to establish new ones. The Senate Finance Committee's bill, S. 667, proposes federal cost-sharing for states' pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month in child support collected for TANF families. The Senate Finance Committee's bill, S. 667, proposes federal cost-sharing for states' pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month in child support collected for TANF families. The federal government would share in the costs of these policies, with states not required to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments. The House bill, H.R. 240, aims to incentivize states to increase their pass-through and disregard policies for child support collected on behalf of TANF families. Unlike S. 667, this bill would not require states to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments. States would be allowed to increase the amount of collected child support they pay to families. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase pass-through and disregard policies for child support collected for TANF families. States can pay more child support to families without reimbursing the federal government. The subsidized payments would be above the state's 2001 levels. The House bill incentivizes states to increase pass-through and disregard policies for child support collected for TANF families. The federal government would share in the cost of increased pass-through payments, with limits set on the amount. The federal government would limit cost-sharing of new pass-through payments to $100 per month or $50 more than the state's previous share with the family. States must disregard child support collections when determining TANF benefits to qualify for federal cost-sharing. Former TANF families must receive child support collections before states and the federal government are reimbursed. Former TANF families are entitled to receive child support collections before states and the federal government are reimbursed, following the \"family-first\" policy outlined in the 1996 welfare reform law. This includes current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and arrearages accrued before TANF benefits were received. The 1996 welfare reform law established a \"family-first\" policy for TANF families, prioritizing their receipt of child support collections over state and federal government reimbursement. This includes current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and arrearages accrued before TANF benefits were received. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritized child support for TANF families, aiming to reduce dependence on public assistance. Child support before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 offers states the choice to distribute to former TANF recipients. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 would allow states to distribute the full amount of child support collected on behalf of former TANF families, including current support and arrearages. This aims to reduce dependence on public assistance by promoting exit from TANF and preventing re-entry. S. 667 and H.R. 240 offer states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected on behalf of former TANF families, including arrearages. This aims to simplify the distribution process and reduce dependence on public assistance. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose sharing the costs of paying child support arrearages with states. The bills offer states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected on behalf of former TANF families, including arrearages. This aims to simplify the distribution process and reduce dependence on public assistance. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose sharing costs of paying child support arrearages with states, including facilitating collection from various sources like Social Security and veterans' benefits. They also aim to lower the threshold for denying passports to noncustodial parents with past-due child support. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to lower the threshold for denying passports to noncustodial parents with past-due child support and facilitate collection from sources like Social Security and veterans' benefits. They also propose allowing states to use federal income tax refund offsets to collect past-due child support. The proposed legislation aims to allow states to use federal income tax refund offsets to collect past-due child support and authorizes the comparison of information on noncustodial parents with insurers to pursue child support arrearages. It also allows assisting states to establish child support interstate cases based on another state's request for assistance. The proposed legislation aims to expand states' ability to collect child support payments by allowing federal income tax refund offsets, comparing information with insurers, and enabling assisting states to establish interstate child support cases. Additional provisions in S. 667 include authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents and requiring cooperation with multi-state financial institutions. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 bill includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments. This includes authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents and requiring medical support for children from both parents. Additionally, the bill mandates CSE agencies to notify health care plan administrators when a child loses coverage. The bills aim to improve child support collection by requiring medical support from parents, notifying health care plan administrators of coverage loss, and reviewing TANF family support orders every three years. Additionally, they establish minimum funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service. The bills aim to improve child support collection by adjusting support orders for TANF families every three years, requiring reports on locating custodial parents, and setting minimum funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service. Additionally, there is a provision for a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but not on TANF. H.R. 240 and S. 667 aim to improve child support collection by adjusting support orders for TANF families every three years, increasing funding for CSE access and visitation programs, and allowing Indian tribes access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. H.R. 240 includes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but not on TANF, while S. 667 requires states to adopt a later version of UIFSA for interstate child support payments and allows Texas to continue its CSE program. S. 667 aims to increase funding for CSE access and visitation programs, require states to adopt a later version of UIFSA for interstate child support payments, and allow Texas to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver. Table 1 provides a comparison of CSE provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240 with current law. The comparison of CSE provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240 with current law is detailed in Table 1, showing the differences in the bills regarding automatic monitoring and enforcement of court orders for nonwelfare families. Table 1 compares Child Support Provisions in current law with S. 667 and H.R. 240."
