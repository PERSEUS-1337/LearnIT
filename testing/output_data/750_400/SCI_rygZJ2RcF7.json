A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this challenge by learning how neurons encode edits for improved out-of-sample generation. Neural networks struggle to generalize transformations beyond their training data. Neuron editing technique aims to improve out-of-sample generation by learning how neurons encode edits for transformations in a latent space. The technique involves using an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and applying transformations in a latent space for complex data changes. It is demonstrated in image domain/style transfer and biological applications like removing noise artifacts and predicting drug synergy. The technique involves using an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and applying transformations in a latent space for complex data changes. It is demonstrated in image domain/style transfer and biological applications like removing noise artifacts and predicting drug synergy. Experiments in biology study the effect of treatments on samples, such as drug administration to groups of cells, often performed on a small subset of the entire population. Mathematically modeling the effects and interactions with background information in biology experiments would provide a powerful tool to assess how treatments generalize beyond measured samples. The proposal suggests using a neural network-based method to learn a general edit function for treatment in biology, allowing for assessment of generalization beyond measured samples. The proposal suggests using a neural network-based method to learn a general edit function for treatment in biology, aiming to go beyond specific sample measurements. This approach reframes the problem as learning an edit function between pre-treatment and post-treatment data distributions, rather than just generating post-treatment data from pre-treatment data. The proposal suggests using a neural network-based method to learn a general edit function for treatment in biology, reframing the problem as learning an edit function between pre-treatment and post-treatment data distributions. The approach involves training an autoencoder on the entire population of data to learn an edit function, termed neuron editing, in the latent space with non-linear activations. The proposal suggests using a neural network-based method to learn an edit function for treatment in biology, termed neuron editing, in the latent space of an autoencoder neural network with non-linear activations. The autoencoder is trained on the entire population of data to represent the data with existing variation decomposed into abstract features (neurons) for accurate data reconstruction. The autoencoder neural network represents data with existing variation decomposed into abstract features. Neuron editing involves extracting differences between pre-and post-treatment activation distributions to synthetically generate post-treatment data. This process encodes complex multivariate edits in the latent space. Neuron editing involves extracting differences between pre-and post-treatment activation distributions to generate post-treatment data in the latent space of neural networks. This process encodes complex multivariate edits in meaningful features. In neuron editing, complex multivariate edits are encoded in the ambient space using denoised and meaningful features. This technique focuses on the autoencoder to model distribution-to-distribution transformations in high-dimensional space efficiently. In this work, the focus is on leveraging the autoencoder's advantages for modeling complex distribution-to-distribution transformations in high-dimensional space. Research shows that working in a lower-dimensional manifold helps in learning transformations that are otherwise infeasible in the original ambient space. The non-linear dimensionality reduction by autoencoders straightens the curvature of data, making complex effects simpler shifts. The non-linear dimensionality reduction by autoencoders facilitates learning transformations in a lower-dimensional manifold, simplifying complex effects into computationally efficient shifts in distribution. Editing the neural network internal layer allows for modeling context dependence with some neurons showing drastic changes between pre and post-treatment versions. By editing the neural network internal layer, complex effects can be simplified into computationally efficient shifts in distribution. Some neurons show drastic changes between pre and post-treatment versions, while others encoding background context information have less change. These edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in complex ways. The editing of neurons in the internal layer of a neural network simplifies complex effects into computationally efficient shifts in distribution. Neurons encoding background context information have less change but still influence the output. Edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in predictive ways, allowing editing on a denoised version of the data. Editing neurons in the internal layer of a neural network simplifies complex effects into computationally efficient shifts in distribution. By editing in a low-dimensional internal layer, significant dimensions are retained while noise dimensions are discarded, allowing for more predictive treatment outcomes. This approach assumes semantic consistency across data manifolds, ensuring that edited neurons encode the same types of features consistently. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder simplifies complex effects into computationally efficient shifts in distribution. It retains significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions, ensuring that edited neurons encode consistent features across data manifolds. This approach is supported by the autoencoder learning a joint manifold of all given data, demonstrating semantic consistency in neuron encoding.

Neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs, with neuron editing extrapolating better than generative models on important criteria. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder simplifies complex effects into computationally efficient shifts in distribution, ensuring consistent features across data manifolds. It demonstrates that neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models on important criteria, producing more complex variation by preserving existing data variation. Comparisons are made with traditional GANs and ResnetGAN to highlight the differences in generating residuals versus editing.

Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder simplifies complex effects into computationally efficient shifts in distribution, ensuring consistent features across data manifolds. Comparisons with traditional GANs and ResnetGAN highlight the differences in generating residuals versus editing. In other applications, GANs struggle with generating plausible individual points, motivating the need for neuron editing during inference. The extrapolation problem is illustrated by attempting natural image domain transfer on the CelebA dataset. The autoencoder performs internal layer transformations during training, with the decoder learning to reconstruct the input unchanged. Neuron editing is detailed, followed by the extrapolation problem demonstrated on the CelebA dataset. Two biological applications where extrapolation is crucial are correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. The CelebA dataset is used to demonstrate the extrapolation problem in two biological applications: correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. GANs learn a transformation that aligns distributions between source and target sets, with ReLU or leaky ReLU activations commonly used for parameterization. The GAN optimization paradigm aims to learn a transformation aligning distributions between source and target sets, but struggles to behave comparably on both. Instead, a transformation is defined in a learned space to address this issue. The transformation in leaky ReLU activations is piecewise linear, but GAN optimization struggles to behave comparably on both source and target sets. To address this, a transformation is defined in a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair to map data into an abstract neuron space with high-level features. The encoder/decoder pair E/D is trained to map data into an abstract neuron space with high-level features. Activations from internal layers are extracted for inputs from source (S) and target (T) sets, and a piecewise linear transformation called NeuronEdit is applied to these distributions of activations. NeuronEdit is a piecewise linear transformation applied to distributions of activations from internal layers of the network for inputs from source (S) and target (T). It operates on percentiles of activations independently on each neuron in the layer. The NeuronEdit function transforms input activation distributions based on the difference between source and target distributions, operating independently on each neuron in the layer. The NeuronEdit function operates on distributions represented by activations over network input samples, transforming them based on the difference between source and target distributions. It has properties similar to a GAN generator and guarantees the same neuron editing on both the source distribution and extrapolation distribution. The NeuronEdit function, similar to a GAN generator, has properties of approximating distributions, maintaining linearity, and ensuring consistent editing between source and extrapolation distributions. To apply the transformation to X, activations from the encoder are extracted and cascaded through the decoder without additional training to obtain the transformed output X. The NeuronEdit function, akin to a GAN generator, approximates distributions and ensures consistent editing between source and extrapolation distributions. To transform X, encoder activations are extracted and passed through the decoder without further training to obtain the transformed output X. The nomenclature of an autoencoder no longer strictly applies as training is frozen to prevent the network from undoing the transformations. The transformed outputX is obtained by applying neuron editing, turning an autoencoder into a generative model. Training a GAN in this setting exclusively utilizes data in S and T, without real examples of the output for X. Neuron editing models the intrinsic variation in X. Training a GAN in this setting exclusively utilizes data in S and T, without real examples of the output for X. Neuron editing models the intrinsic variation in X, providing more information compared to GANs. Modeling the intrinsic variation of X in an unsupervised manner is challenging due to the lack of real posttransformation data. GANs, while effective, are difficult to train due to issues such as oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse where the discriminator fails to distinguish between real and fake examples. Mode collapse in GANs refers to the generator producing very realistic but repetitive outputs, making it difficult for the discriminator to distinguish between real and fake examples. This can lead to the generator favoring simple outputs over the complex variability of real data. The discriminator struggles to detect differences in real and fake distributions, with the generator favoring simpler outputs over the natural variability of real data. Neuron editing avoids these issues by learning an unsupervised model of the data space with an autoencoder, facilitating generation. Neuron editing, similar to word2vec embeddings in natural language processing, learns an unsupervised model of data space with an autoencoder to isolate variations in neuron activations between source and target distributions for generation. Neuron editing is an extension of word2vec embeddings in natural language processing, where a constant vector in a latent space can be learned on one example and extrapolated to predict locations in the space for other examples. Neuron editing is a complex extension of word2vec embeddings, allowing for the transformation of entire distributions in a latent space. It is compared to other generating methods like regularized autoencoders, GANs, ResnetGANs, and CycleGANs. Neuron editing transforms entire distributions in a latent space, compared to other generating methods like regularized autoencoders, GANs, ResnetGANs, and CycleGANs. The regularized autoencoder penalizes differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy. Different layer configurations were used in the experiments, with leaky ReLU activation consistently applied. The experiment penalized differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy in a latent layer. Convolutional layers with specific filters were used for the image experiment, while fully connected layers were used for other models. Training was done with minibatches, the adam optimizer, and a learning rate of 0.001. A motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset was considered. ReLU activation with 0.2 leak was used for training with minibatches of size 100 and the adam optimizer BID16. A motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset explored the limitations of training a generative model to map between images with different hair colors. The model could only apply the color change to images similar to those in the training data, unable to extrapolate. The limitations of training a generative model to map between images with different hair colors were explored using a motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset. The model could only apply the color change to images similar to those in the training data, unable to extrapolate to unseen examples. The experiment on the CelebA dataset showed that GAN models struggle to extrapolate transformations to unseen examples, particularly in changing hair color. The models often fail to accurately recreate input images, especially in areas other than the hair color, resulting in artifacts. The GAN models struggle to accurately model transformations on out-of-sample data, especially in changing hair color. They often fail to recreate input images accurately, resulting in artifacts. This highlights the benefits of stable training methods like autoencoders and neuron editing. The difficulty in training GAN models results in artifacts, emphasizing the advantages of stable training methods like autoencoders and neuron editing. Neuron editing allows for complex transformations in the neuron space, such as changing hair color, through a simple linear shift. Neuron editing enables complex transformations in the neuron space, like changing hair color through a simple linear shift. Another application is batch correction, addressing differences in data caused by technical artifacts during measurement. Batch correction is the ability to learn to transform a distribution based on a separate source/target pair to address differences in data caused by technical artifacts during measurement. Batch effects are a common problem in biological experimental data that can lead to wrong conclusions. Various models, including deep learning methods, aim to tackle batch effects. One method for addressing batch effects in biological experimental data is to repeatedly measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation in its version of the control. This approach aims to transform the data distribution to mitigate the impact of technical artifacts during measurement. One method for addressing batch effects in biological experimental data is to repeatedly measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation in its version of the control. In our study, we choose Control1/Control2 as the source/target pair and extrapolate to Sample1 to compare it with raw Sample2 cells, removing any variation induced by the measurement process. This approach aims to transform the data distribution to mitigate technical artifacts during measurement. The dataset investigated in this section comes from a mass cytometry experiment measuring proteins in cells from two individuals infected with dengue virus. Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2 have different numbers of observations. The two samples were measured in separate runs. The data analyzed in this section is from a mass cytometry experiment measuring proteins in cells from two individuals infected with dengue virus. Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2 have varying numbers of observations. The two samples were measured in separate runs, leading to both biological and technical variations between them. One batch effect observed is artificially low readings of the protein InfG in Control1. The goal is for the model to identify these variations. In addition to biological differences between two samples, technical artifacts also contribute to variation. A batch effect is observed with artificially low readings of protein InfG in Control1. The model aims to identify and compensate for this variation without losing true biological differences, such as higher values of protein CCR6 in Sample1. The model aims to compensate for batch effects like low InfG readings in Control1 without losing true biological differences, such as high CCR6 values in Sample1. However, GANs and CycleGANs fail to preserve these biological variations, mapping most cells to the same low CCR6 values. The GANs and CycleGANs fail to preserve biological variations, mapping most cells to low CCR6 values, losing important information about high CCR6 levels in the cells. The ResnetGAN also does not address this issue due to the generation objective encouraging output similar to the target distribution. The ResnetGAN fails to preserve biological variations in cells with high CCR6 levels, as it produces output similar to the target distribution, resulting in low CCR6 values. The model learns to generate more ellipsoid data instead of preserving the original source distribution's variation.

Neuron editing decomposes variability into controls and edits the sample to include this variation, removing batch effects while preserving real variation.

The source is defined as basal cells, the target as Das cells, and extrapolation to Bez cells is attempted. Neuron editing accurately models the decrease in p4EBP1 without introducing vertical change. The regularized autoencoder does not change the output despite manipulations in its internal layer. GAN models do not accurately predict the real combination, introducing additional vertical shifts and losing original variability within the dataset. Despite attempts to extrapolate to Bez cells, the ResnetGAN model fails to accurately predict the real combination, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variability within the dataset. The ResnetGAN model struggles to accurately mimic the target distribution, even with residual connections. Neuron editing is used to evaluate global transformation, comparing every dimension for meaningful changes. Neuron editing in GANs aims to replicate target data but struggles to do so accurately. A comparison of real and predicted means and variances across all dimensions shows that neuron editing better predicts transformation direction and magnitude, preserving variation more effectively than GANs. Neuron editing in GANs outperforms GANs in predicting transformation direction and magnitude, preserving data variation more effectively. The GAN tends to generate data with less variance than actually exists.
