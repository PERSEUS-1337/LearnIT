The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts for public review and comment. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for developing five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The program development process involves multiple drafts for public review and comment, with leasing areas examined and narrowed based on economic and environmental analysis before final leasing schedules are determined. The Secretary of the Interior must submit each program to the President and Congress for approval after a 60-day review period. The leasing areas are examined and narrowed based on economic and environmental analysis to arrive at a final leasing schedule. The Secretary of the Interior must submit each program to the President and Congress for approval after a 60-day review period. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The planning process for leasing areas includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) required by NEPA. Public comments are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program itself. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program easily due to review and comment requirements under OCSLA and NEPA. The Administration cannot easily revise a finalized program due to review and comment requirements under OCSLA and NEPA. Scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during program implementation, but not added. BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas plan on November 18, 2016. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. It included 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. It included 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Three sales proposed in earlier versions were not included in the final program. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 approved 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf: 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Congress plays a role in the planning process for these programs, although they do not have approval authority. Congress plays a role in the planning process for the five-year oil and gas leasing programs, influencing them through public comments, oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. Members of Congress can influence the five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs by submitting public comments, participating in oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. The 114th Congress utilized these methods to influence the proposed program for 2017-2022. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of the program. The 114th Congress utilized various methods to influence the proposed 2017-2022 offshore oil and gas leasing program. The report covers the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of the program. Congressional oversight and legislation related to the program are also discussed. For more details and issues related to the program, refer to CRS Report R44692. The report discusses the role of Congress in oversight and legislation related to the 2017-2022 offshore oil and gas leasing program. In 1953, Congress enacted laws addressing jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States, including regulation of subsurface oil and gas exploration. Coastal states are generally entitled to an area extending 3 geographical miles from their coast. In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA to address jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States, including regulation of subsurface oil and gas exploration. The Submerged Lands Act grants coastal states rights to an area extending 3 geographical miles from their coasts, while the OCSLA defines the OCS as submerged lands subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The OCSLA aims for the orderly development of OCS resources with environmental safeguards. The OCSLA defines the OCS as submerged lands subject to U.S. jurisdiction, aiming for orderly development of resources with environmental safeguards to achieve national energy goals. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18, which mandates the creation and maintenance of an OCS in a manner consistent with national energy goals and environmental protection. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions for environmental protection, state and local government involvement, and a competitive leasing process. Section 18 mandated the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for five-year periods. These programs have guided OCS oil and gas exploration and production since 1980. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 mandated the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for five-year periods. These programs have guided OCS oil and gas exploration and production since 1980, with subsequent actions by Congress altering the scope of offshore exploration, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 were additional actions taken by Congress to alter offshore oil and gas exploration and production after the 1978 amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain regions for oil and gas exploration, revenue sharing with Gulf states, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congress removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions starting in 2008, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain regions for oil and gas exploration, revenue sharing with Gulf states, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congress removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions starting in 2008, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes the OCSLA, NEPA, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. The framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes the OCSLA, NEPA, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program to meet national energy needs for the following five years. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program to meet national energy needs for the next five years, considering economic, social, and environmental values. The program includes a schedule of proposed lease sales indicating the size, timing, and location of leasing activity. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values. Section 18 directs the Secretary to schedule oil and gas exploration based on various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws and policies. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws and policies. Leasing under the five-year program must assure fair market value for lands leased and rights conveyed by the Federal Government. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws and policies. Leasing under the five-year program must assure fair market value for lands leased and rights conveyed by the Federal Government. Additionally, the program must include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs, as well as consultation requirements with interested Federal agencies. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics. The five-year program must include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. Consultation requirements involve inviting suggestions from interested Federal agencies, the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and Governors of affected states. The Secretary may also consult with local government officials in affected states. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values. Consultation requirements involve inviting suggestions from interested Federal agencies, the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and Governors of affected states. The Secretary may also consult with local government officials in affected states. Once the Secretary has prepared a proposed program, it must be submitted to the governor of each affected state for further comments at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The OCSLA also authorizes the Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, to submit comments regarding potential effects of the proposed program. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values. Once the proposed program is prepared, it must be submitted to the governor of each affected state for comments at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, can also submit comments on potential competition effects. Subsequently, the Secretary must submit the proposed program to Congress and the President for approval, along with explanations for any rejected recommendations. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to Congress and the President for approval, along with explanations for any rejected recommendations. The Secretary is then free to approve a final five-year program, with the ability to revise it at any time, subject to a mandated review process. The OCSLA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to develop a leasing program, which can be revised at any time. The responsibilities under the OCSLA are carried out by BOEM, with regulations detailing consultation requirements with affected states. The Secretary of the Interior authorizes the leasing program under the OCSLA, which is implemented by BOEM. Regulations require BOEM to consult with affected states, including sending letters to governors for input on laws and policies. The proposed program is published in the Federal Register. Other federal statutes also influence the five-year planning process. The OCSLA authorizes the leasing program, implemented by BOEM, which consults with states for input on laws and policies. The proposed program is published in the Federal Register. NEPA and CZMA also play a role in the five-year planning process, requiring detailed environmental impact statements for major federal actions. The five-year program formation involves compliance with NEPA and CZMA, requiring detailed environmental impact statements for major federal actions. NEPA mandates agencies to assess environmental impacts and alternatives, with an environmental assessment determining if an action significantly affects the environment. If deemed major without an EA, agencies proceed to preparing the environmental statement. The process for compliance with environmental requirements includes an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an action significantly affects the environment. If deemed major without an EA, agencies prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). BOEM's five-year programs assume significance on the environment and prepare a programmatic EIS (PEIS) concurrently with the program. BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) alongside the five-year program to assess environmental impact and alternatives. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. The CZMA encourages states to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection, emphasizing preservation alongside sustainable development. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance and must address water pollution sources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) encourages states to develop approved programs for habitat and resource protection. These programs must address conservation measures, permissible land and water uses, and water pollution sources. Federal regulations require compliance with state programs in leasing program development. The BOEM regulations governing the five-year program require compliance with state coastal zone management programs. BOEM requests information on the relationship between state programs and OCS oil and gas activity from governors and the Secretary of Commerce before developing the leasing program. The development of a five-year program typically takes two to three years. The BOEM regulations require information on the relationship between state coastal zone management programs and OCS oil and gas activity from governors and the Secretary of Commerce before developing the leasing program. The development of a five-year program typically takes two to three years, with drafts published for review and comment from state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each step involves additional public comment. The development of a five-year program for OCS oil and gas activity takes place over two to three years, with drafts published for review and comment from various stakeholders. The process involves consultation with state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President, as well as public comment and environmental review at each step. Individual lease sales and companies' exploration and development plans also undergo environmental review and public comment before oil and gas production begins. The development of a five-year program for OCS oil and gas activity involves public comment and environmental review. Individual lease sales and companies' exploration plans also undergo review before production begins. The successive drafts of the program represent a winnowing process, analyzing planning areas and considering public input. The successive drafts of the five-year program for OCS oil and gas activity represent a winnowing process, analyzing planning areas and considering public input to develop an initial schedule of proposed lease sales. Subsequent versions of the plan focus on further analysis and environmental review of the listed areas, with the possibility of removing proposed sales but not adding new ones. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) develops a new five-year program by analyzing planning areas and considering public input to create an initial schedule of proposed lease sales. Subsequent versions of the plan focus on further analysis and environmental review of the listed areas, with the possibility of removing proposed sales but not adding new ones. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) develops a new five-year program by analyzing planning areas and considering public input to create an initial schedule of proposed lease sales. The agency may remove proposed sales at the final stage but cannot add new sales without reverting to an earlier stage of the process and undertaking new environmental reviews. The process begins with a Request for Information (RFI) published in the Federal Register to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and input from state and local governments, tribes, and the public for the next five-year period. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) develops a new five-year program through a Request for Information (RFI) published in the Federal Register to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and input from state and local governments, tribes, and the public. The RFI for the 2017-2022 leasing program was published on June 16, 2014, followed by a comment period with over half a million comments received. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published a draft proposed program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program after receiving over half a million comments during the comment period following the Request for Information (RFI). The DPP is the initial proposal for lease sales in the upcoming five-year period and is the first of three decision documents leading to BOEM's final program. It analyzes all available OCS planning areas for leasing, identifies areas proposed for lease sales, and includes a preliminary schedule. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published a draft proposed program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, which analyzes all available OCS planning areas for leasing and identifies areas proposed for lease sales over the next five years. BOEM received over 1 million comments on the DPP, and also issued a notice of intent (NOI) to publish a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for the proposed lease. BOEM published a draft proposed program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, which includes a preliminary schedule for proposed sales.

The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released by BOEM on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior approved the final program on January 17, 2017. The Secretary approved the final program for 2017-2022, which becomes final after approval. Former Secretary Sally Jewell issued a record of decision on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress, each taking effect after a 60-day review period. These programs reflect different presidential administrations' offshore oil and gas leasing policies. The 2012-2017 five-year program was submitted to Congress by the Obama Administration under Secretary Ken Salazar, reflecting their policies on offshore energy development. Previous submissions dating back to 1980 have also been approved after a 60-day review period, reflecting different presidential administrations' leasing policies. The Obama Administration submitted the 2012-2017 five-year offshore energy development program to Congress under Secretary Ken Salazar. It included 15 proposed lease sales, with 11 lease sales held by late November 2016. Two of the three Alaska sales were later canceled. The 2007-2012 five-year offshore energy program was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration, reflecting their policies on domestic energy production and environmental protection. It included 21 sales and went into effect in July 2007. The 2007-2012 five-year offshore energy program was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration under the direction of former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne. It included 21 sales and went into effect in July 2007. The program was revised by the DOI in accordance with a 2009 court order. The Obama Administration resubmitted the program to Congress in 2010 with a schedule of 16 sales, of which 11 were held. The 2007-2012 offshore energy program, initially with 21 sales, was revised by DOI in 2009. The Obama Administration resubmitted it in 2010 with 16 sales, of which 11 were held. The program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 OCS leasing plan had 20 lease sales, 15 of which were held under Secretary Gale Norton. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan, submitted in 2002 under Secretary Gale Norton, included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007.

The 1992-1997 program, presented in 1992 under Secretary Manuel Lujan, included a schedule of 18 lease sales, with twelve sales held before the program expired in June 1997. The 1992-1997 program, presented in 1992 under Secretary Manuel Lujan, included a schedule of 18 lease sales, with twelve sales held before the program expired in June 1997. The 1987-1992 program, presented in 1987 under Secretary Donald Hodel, had a lease sale schedule with 42 sales, 17 of which were held before the program expired in June 1992. The 1980-1982 program, presented in 1982 under Secretary James Watt, had a lease sale schedule with 41 sales, 23 of which were held before the program expired in June 1987. The 1980-1982 program, presented in 1982 under Secretary James Watt, had a lease sale schedule with 41 sales, 23 of which were held before the program expired in June 1987. The plan was consistent with the Reagan Administration's national energy policies. The original Section 18 submission for domestic oil and gas leasing was prepared in October 1978 under President Carter's \"Energy Message\" and approved in June 1980. The program proposed 36 sales, with 12 held, succeeding the program prior to 1980 which had over 3,000 tracts leased. The proposal for domestic oil and gas leasing was approved in June 1980 under President Carter's \"Energy Message.\" The program included 36 sales, with 12 held, succeeding the program prior to 1980 which had over 3,000 tracts leased. In November 2016, BOEM released its offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The BOEM released its final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS, including the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The program identifies four OCS regions and 26 planning areas. The BOEM's final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 schedules lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015, a decline from FY2010. In FY2015, U.S. offshore crude oil production decreased to 16% of total production from 31% in FY2010. Offshore natural gas production also declined to 4% from 9.5% in FY2010. U.S. total crude production reached near-record levels of 9.4 million barrels per day in FY2015, a 73% increase from FY2010. Offshore natural gas production accounted for 4% of total production, down from 9.5% in FY2010. Offshore natural gas volumes fell by nearly 50% between FY2010 and FY2015, while total annual U.S. natural gas production rose by over 30%. The surge in U.S. crude oil and natural gas production is due to increased production of shale gas and shale oil in unconventional onshore formations. The surge in U.S. crude oil and natural gas production from FY2010 to FY2015 was driven by increased production of shale gas and shale oil in unconventional onshore formations. This led to a 30% rise in total U.S. natural gas production, reducing the need for imports from OPEC countries. Shale oil plays have lower production costs compared to deepwater plays, contributing to the overall increase in production. The surge in U.S. oil production from shale plays like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford has reduced imports from OPEC countries. Shale oil plays have lower production costs than deepwater plays. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS, with most located in the Central Gulf of Mexico. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS, with the majority in the Central Gulf of Mexico. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over the 2015-2020 period. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts decreased domestic investment in oil and gas projects from 2015-2020, impacting future production levels. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) estimates a decline in bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years, with projections dropping from $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019 to around $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. The ONRR predicts a significant decrease in offshore leasing revenues over the next five years, with estimates dropping from $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019 to around $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. The decline is attributed to lower crude oil prices, impacting new investment in oil production on federal lands, especially offshore. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates decreased from $80-$90 per barrel in FY2015 to $50-$60 per barrel in FY2017. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. BOEM emphasizes energy diversification in the 2017-2022 PP. Offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. Energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, remains vital for meeting the country's energy needs. Oil and gas exploration and production proceed in stages with increased data. \"Diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, is crucial for meeting the country's energy needs. New production from other OCS regions can also contribute. Oil and gas exploration involves stages with increasing data certainty about resource volumes. Discovered oil and gas volumes are measured as reserves within pools or fields.\" Prior to drilling wells, estimated volumes of oil and gas are termed undiscovered resources. When oil or gas is discovered, the volumes are measured within pools or fields via well penetration or other technology, and are called reserves. Reserves are reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the owners of the wells. Reserves have been reported for U.S. OCS areas that have been developed, but no reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS. According to BOEM, the U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS, and only modest oil reserves are found on the Alaska OCS. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, with most resources in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources include 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority of these resources. The Gulf of Mexico contains 54% of the estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources for oil and 43% for natural gas. Alaska's UTRR estimates are mainly in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts in OCS region planning. In preparing its five-year programs under the OCSLA, BOEM must consider the resource potential of individual OCS regions and planning areas, along with environmental and socioeconomic impacts of oil and gas leasing. Some U.S. OCS areas were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. Some areas of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. This included regions in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico and Alaska Withdrawal Areas. The 2017-2022 program excluded areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico due to the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. President Obama also withdrew certain ocean areas in Alaska, affecting leasing in the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. President Obama withdrew certain ocean areas in Alaska from leasing, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also off-limits for future oil and gas leasing activities. In December 2016, President Obama withdrew parts of the U.S. Arctic, including the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea, from future oil and gas leasing activities. Protected areas in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also off-limits for leasing. In December 2016, President Obama withdrew parts of the U.S. Arctic, including the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea, from future oil and gas leasing activities. Protected areas in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also off-limits for leasing. The President's withdrawals in December 2016 did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program. The President's December 2016 withdrawals included parts of the U.S. Arctic and planning areas in the North Bering Sea, as well as certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals did not affect the 2017-2022 leasing program but will impact future leasing considerations. BOEM's tailored leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region separately based on leasing criteria outlined in the OCSLA. The BOEM's tailored leasing strategy evaluates U.S. ocean regions separately based on leasing criteria outlined in the OCSLA. Factors considered include oil and gas potential, infrastructure, environmental issues, and state interests. The final program includes 11 lease sales. BOEM evaluates U.S. ocean regions separately for leasing based on factors like oil and gas potential, infrastructure, environmental issues, and state interests. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. An Atlantic lease sale and two Alaska lease sales proposed earlier were not included in the final program. The final program includes a total of 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, accounting for almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. OCS. The Gulf of Mexico region is the most mature in terms of proven and estimated resources. The BOEM program offers lease sales for almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. OCS, with the Gulf of Mexico being the most mature region. This region has the most abundant resources, industry interest, and infrastructure, accounting for 97% of U.S. offshore production. Gulf states like Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama support offshore oil and gas activities. The Gulf of Mexico region has the most abundant oil and gas resources, with broad industry interest and well-developed infrastructure. It accounts for 97% of U.S. offshore production and is supported by Gulf states like Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. The majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in the Gulf region, with three BOEM planning areas: Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf. The 2017-2022 program includes 10 out of 11 proposed sales in the Gulf region, which consists of the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf planning areas. The Eastern Gulf and a portion of the Central Gulf are closed to leasing due to a congressional moratorium. BOEM has replaced area-specific sales with region-wide sales offering all available lease blocks in the Gulf. BOEM has replaced area-specific lease sales in the Gulf with region-wide sales for the 2017-2022 program, providing more flexibility to industry and fewer lease sales overall. BOEM has made changes to the lease sales in the Gulf for the 2017-2022 program, offering more flexibility to industry with fewer overall lease sales. The final program includes fewer lease sales in the Gulf compared to previous five-year programs. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about the reduced number of lease sales. The final program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf compared to previous five-year programs, with some Members of Congress expressing concerns about the decrease. BOEM attributed the lower number of sales to the consolidation of area-specific sales in the Gulf, offering all available blocks at each sale to increase availability in individual planning areas. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreased summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season. Recent estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters have also increased interest, despite the region's severe weather conditions. Sales have decreased in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS, leading to increased interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas due to decreased summer polar ice. Challenges such as severe weather and lack of infrastructure continue to pose obstacles to new exploration. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with existing federal leases, with only the Beaufort Sea having producing wells in federal waters. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS is increasing despite challenges like severe weather and lack of infrastructure. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with existing federal leases, with only the Beaufort Sea having producing wells in federal waters. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, are pushing for expansion, while others, including environmental groups, oppose drilling due to concerns about potential oil spills. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, seek to expand offshore oil and gas activities in federal waters. Some environmental groups oppose drilling in the Arctic due to concerns about oil spills and climate change. The Obama Administration supported offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic while implementing safety regulations to prevent oil spills. BOEM included lease sales in the 2012-2017 five-year program. The Obama Administration supported expanding offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic while implementing safety regulations to prevent oil spills. BOEM included lease sales in the Alaska region, but canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. The 2017-2022 program drafts also included Alaska lease sales. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. The final program for 2017-2022 only included a lease sale for Cook Inlet, removing sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. BOEM considered factors favoring sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi planning areas. BOEM removed lease sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in the final program, retaining only the sale for Cook Inlet. Factors considered included significant hydrocarbon resources and state support, but ultimately sales were rejected due to existing lease opportunities and the unique Arctic ecosystem. BOEM decided against lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to declining industry interest, low oil prices, and sufficient existing domestic energy sources. BOEM noted declining industry interest in Arctic exploration due to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea. Active leases on the Arctic OCS decreased by over 90% between February and November 2016. Companies gave up leases rather than investing further. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) reported a significant decrease in industry interest in Arctic exploration following low oil prices and Shell Oil Company's failed drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. The number of active leases on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) dropped by more than 90% between February and November 2016 as companies relinquished leases to avoid further investment costs. BOEM anticipates a potential increase in industry interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas after the 2017-2022 period, citing a stronger U.S. energy outlook. The agency also concluded that the two Arctic lease sales were not immediately necessary to meet U.S. energy demands due to the current robust domestic energy supply. BOEM noted a decline in Arctic exploration interest due to low oil prices and Shell's failed drilling. Industry interest may increase in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas post-2017. The Arctic lease sales were deemed unnecessary for U.S. energy needs. President Obama withdrew portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration for an indefinite time period. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region that was proposed in the DPP version of the program. This would have been the first offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Atlantic since 1983. Congressional bans on Atlantic leasing have contributed to the lack of oil and gas activity in the region in the past 30 years. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region that was proposed in the DPP version of the program. The lack of oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region in the past 30 years was due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria on offshore leasing. President George W. Bush removed the long-standing administrative withdrawal. Since FY1983, congressional bans and presidential moratoria prevented Atlantic leasing until FY2008. In FY2009, Congress removed the leasing moratorium, allowing potential lease sales. However, no Atlantic lease sale has occurred since then. As of December 2016, parts of the Atlantic are under a new presidential moratorium. The administrative withdrawal for the Atlantic region was removed, allowing potential lease sales. However, no Atlantic lease sale has occurred since then. Certain parts of the Atlantic are under a presidential moratorium as of December 2016. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region for the 2017-2022 program. BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region under the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, safety concerns, and state attitudes towards drilling. A planned lease sale in the Mid- and South Atlantic areas was scheduled for 2021 but was later withdrawn. The initial analysis for the DPP resulted in a planned lease sale in a combined portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021. However, after further analysis, BOEM removed the Atlantic sale due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and current market dynamics. After further analysis, BOEM removed the Atlantic sale from the DPP due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and current market dynamics. BOEM cited conflicts with existing uses such as ocean-dependent tourism, fishing, shipping, and Department of Defense and NASA activities. BOEM cited conflicts with existing ocean uses, including tourism, fishing, shipping, and military activities, as reasons for not holding an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period. The agency noted that the Gulf of Mexico has a history of offshore mineral production, unlike the Atlantic, which raised concerns among stakeholders. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to concerns raised by stakeholders over conflicts with existing ocean uses. BOEM cited the lack of offshore mineral production history in the Atlantic and noted that domestic oil and gas production will remain strong without additional production from the Atlantic region. The 2017-2022 program also does not schedule any lease sales for the Pacific region. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to concerns over conflicts with existing ocean uses. BOEM stated that domestic oil and gas production will remain strong without additional production from the Atlantic region. No lease sales are scheduled for the Pacific region in the 2017-2022 program. Federal oil and gas lease sales have not been held in the Pacific region since 1984, but some active leases with production remain in the Southern California planning area. No federal oil and gas lease sales have been held for the Pacific region since 1984, despite active leases with production in Southern California. Congressional and presidential leasing moratoria were in place for the past 30 years, but were lifted in FY2009. However, the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments on a draft program.

Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. Congress also reviews each finalized program under the OCSLA. Members of Congress can influence the Administration's five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress engaged in various forms of influence regarding the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress may also address it through legislation. Members of Congress can influence the Administration's five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress pursued various forms of influence on the proposed 2017-2022 program, receiving comments from Members on different aspects. The 115th Congress has the option to address the program through legislation or choose not to do so. Members of Congress, along with other stakeholders, can submit comments on draft versions of five-year programs. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM received comments from Members on the initial request for information (RFI), the DPP, and the PP. Some comments opposed certain regions in the program, while others supported lease sales or sought an expansion of lease areas. Some comments from Members on the PP opposed certain regions in the program, while others supported lease sales or sought an expansion of lease areas. The comments also addressed related issues such as seismic testing in the Atlantic. BOEM considers these public comments when developing successive drafts of the five-year program. Each draft includes an appendix summarizing the comments received on the previous version, including those from Members of Congress, and BOEM's response to each.

Each draft includes an appendix summarizing comments and BOEM's responses. The House or Senate may hold oversight hearings to evaluate the proposed program. After BOEM releases a draft of a five-year oil and gas leasing program, the House or Senate may hold oversight hearings to evaluate it. These hearings help inform legislative decision-making and provide an opportunity for BOEM to hear Members' views. Members and witnesses discuss issues such as the number of lease sales, leasing in the Atlantic and Arctic, and seismic surveying in the Atlantic. After BOEM released the DPP for 2017-2022, hearings were held by the House and Senate to discuss issues like lease sales in the Atlantic and Arctic, seismic surveying, and targeted lease sales in Alaska. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the PP version of the program, discussing targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale from the 2017-2022 program. Congress may use legislation to modify the program, such as adding or removing lease sales. The 114th Congress considered legislation that could impact the program. The 114th Congress considered legislation that could impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program, including bills that were not enacted. H.R. 1487 and S. 791 proposed using an earlier-drafted program for FY2015-FY2020. Legislation in the 114th Congress, including H.R. 1487 and S. 791, aimed to use a previous draft program for FY2015-FY2020, but none of the bills were enacted. The proposed program would have included 31 lease sales, with 3 excluded from the final program. Additionally, the bills would have required BOEM to conduct a sale in the Atlantic region within a year of enactment. The proposed legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to use a previous draft program for FY2015-FY2020, including 31 lease sales with 3 excluded. The bills would have required BOEM to conduct a sale in the Atlantic region within a year of enactment and mandated lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest. The bills also declared the program approved under NEPA, with no further environmental review needed. The proposed legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to use a previous draft program for FY2015-FY2020, including 31 lease sales with 3 excluded.
