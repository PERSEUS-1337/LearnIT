The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia are descendants and political successors to the original Creek Indian Nation at the time of European contact and signatories of the 1832 Treaty of Washington. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, descendants and political successors to the signatories of the 1832 Treaty of Washington, declined removal and continue to operate as a sovereign tribe with over 2,500 eligible members residing close to their ancestral homeland in Georgia. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, with over 2,500 eligible members, chose not to be removed according to the 1832 Treaty of Washington.

The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, comprising those Lower Creeks who declined removal under the 1832 Treaty of Washington, continues its political and social existence with a viable tribal government. In 1972, the tribe petitioned for Federal recognition as the Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe East of the Mississippi River. In 1972, the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs for Federal recognition but lacked critical historical information due to a lack of education and resources.

Despite this, political leaders of the Tribe have been recognized by the Federal Government, the government of Georgia, and local governments. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
