Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in approximately 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at genetic risk. There is currently no effective treatment to halt or slow the disease's progression, with clinical indicators including loss of movement control and cognitive impairment. Huntington's Disease affects 30,000 individuals in the US, with another 200,000 at genetic risk. There is no effective treatment to slow the disease's progression. Clinical indicators include loss of movement control, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms between 30 and 50 years of age, while late-onset occurs after 50 years with a milder course.
