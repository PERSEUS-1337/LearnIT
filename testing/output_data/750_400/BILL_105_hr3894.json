Congress acknowledges the importance of scientific research and technology development in ensuring America's aeronautical defenses. A strong research base is crucial for maintaining air, space, and information superiority. Investment in Air Force research and development is crucial for maintaining air, space, and information superiority. The vision of Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold to build the Air Force around science remains vital today. Investment in Air Force research and development, based on General Henry H. Arnold's vision, has greatly benefited American industry, particularly the aerospace sector, and has made significant contributions to the American economy. The text chunk discusses the importance of science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force, highlighting its significant contributions to American industry and the economy. Congress emphasizes the need for dedicated funding for emerging technologies within the Air Force, with a minimum of 2.5 percent of funds allocated to science and technology. It also calls for separate management and funding for science and technology compared to acquisition, and at least 15 percent of funds should be invested in new technology areas. The Air Force should have separate management and funding for acquisition. At least 15 percent of science and technology funds should be invested in new technology areas for the next 5 years. Increasing the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees is also recommended to meet future technological challenges. The Air Force should invest at least 15 percent of science and technology funds in new technology areas for the next 5 years. To meet future technological challenges, they should increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields and expand the variety of technical degrees at the master's level. To prevent stagnation in Air Force science and technology, a concentrated effort should be made to eliminate 5 percent of programs annually, reallocating funds to new programs. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Amendments are made to separate the research and development function from the equipping function of the Secretary of the Air Force. This includes adding a new paragraph for research and development and amending sections related to the research and development function of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.

Amendments are made to establish the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology, increasing the number of Assistant Secretaries to five. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology will have the principal duty of supervising research and development functions. Amendments establish the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology, increasing the number of Assistant Secretaries to five. The Assistant Secretary will supervise research and development functions. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology is also established. Amendments establish the Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology within the Department of the Air Force. This position is added to oversee research and development functions. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology, addressing the effects on national defense and civilian industries. The National Research Council will study the Air Force's technology base to recommend minimum requirements for air and space weapons systems and information technology superiority, address effects on national defense and civilian industries, and determine appropriate staff levels with advanced degrees. The National Research Council will study the Air Force's technology base to recommend staff levels with advanced degrees and submit a report to Congress within 120 days of completing the study."
