Additionally, modifications are made to required distribution rules for pension plans. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to require distributions from a trust if an employee dies before their interest is fully distributed. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now mandates that if an employee passes away before their interest is fully distributed from a trust, the entire interest must be distributed within 5 years after their death, with an exception for eligible designated beneficiaries. The employee's interest must be distributed within 5 years after their death, with an exception for eligible designated beneficiaries. The employee's interest is payable to an eligible designated beneficiary, distributed over their life expectancy, and distributions begin after the employee's death. If the employee's interest is payable to an eligible designated beneficiary, distributions must begin within 1 year of the employee's death or a later date set by the Secretary. Special rule for surviving spouse: Distributions must begin within 1 year of the employee's death or a later date set by the Secretary for eligible designated beneficiaries. The distributions for the surviving spouse of the employee must begin within 1 year of the employee's death or a later date set by the Secretary for eligible designated beneficiaries. If the surviving spouse is the eligible designated beneficiary, the distributions are treated as distributed on the date they begin. The distributions for the surviving spouse of the employee must begin within 1 year of the employee's death or a later date set by the Secretary for eligible designated beneficiaries, with the requirement that distributions cannot begin before the employee would have attained age 70 1/2. If the surviving spouse dies before distributions begin, this rule applies. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before distributions begin, the rules apply as if the surviving spouse were the employee. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before distributions begin, the rules apply as if the surviving spouse were the employee. If the beneficiary dies before the employee's interest is fully distributed, the remaining portion must be distributed within 5 years. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before distributions begin, the rules apply as if the surviving spouse were the employee. If the beneficiary dies before the employee's interest is fully distributed, the remaining portion must be distributed within 5 years. Definitions and rules relating to designated beneficiary are amended in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amends definitions and rules for designated beneficiaries. An eligible designated beneficiary is defined as an individual designated by the employee. Designated beneficiary is any individual chosen by the employee. An eligible designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse or a designated beneficiary specified by the employee at the time of their death. Designated beneficiary means the surviving spouse, a child under majority age, or a disabled individual of the employee at the time of their death. The designated beneficiary can be the surviving spouse, a child under majority age, a disabled individual, or a chronically ill individual. The curr_chunk describes a chronically ill individual as defined in section 7702B(c)(2), with specific requirements that need to be met for certification. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for an individual to be considered chronically ill under section 7702B(c)(2), including the requirement of a lengthy period of inability. The curr_chunk explains that an individual described in clause (ii)(II) will no longer be an eligible designated beneficiary once they reach majority age. An individual described in clause (ii)(II) will cease to be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority age, and any remaining portion of an employee's interest must be distributed within 5 years after that date. An individual described in clause (ii)(II) will cease to be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority age, and any remaining portion of an employee's interest payable to the individual must be distributed within 5 years after that date. Additionally, Section 401(a)(9)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new clause regarding employees becoming 5-percent owners after age 70\\1/2\\. Employees who become 5-percent owners after age 70 1/2 will have their retirement year adjusted accordingly. Employees who become 5-percent owners after age 70 1/2 will have their retirement year adjusted accordingly for distributions after December 31, 2013. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions for employees who die after December 31, 2013, and to employees becoming 5-percent owners for plan years ending before, on, or after the enactment of this Act. The Act applies to employees becoming 5-percent owners for plan years ending before, on, or after the enactment date. If an employee became a 5-percent owner before January 1, 2013, and has not retired by 2014, they are treated as a 5-percent owner for that plan year. If an employee became a 5-percent owner before January 1, 2013, and has not retired by 2014, they are treated as a 5-percent owner for that plan year. There is an exception for certain beneficiaries if the employee dies before January 1, 2014, but the beneficiary dies after December 31, 2013. The amendments made in 2013 apply to beneficiaries of employees who die before January 1, 2014, and the designated beneficiary is treated as an eligible designated beneficiary for tax purposes.
