    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on the risk characteristics of enrollees. For example, if women's healthcare costs are $100 more than men's, insurers could be paid $100 more for enrolling women to prevent bias. In a hypothetical scenario, adjusting payments to insurers based on gender could prevent bias and ensure equal enrollment of men and women in health plans. By paying insurers $100 more for enrolling women and $100 less for enrolling men, the playing field could be leveled, making insurers indifferent between the two genders. This risk adjustment strategy aims to reflect the different expected health expenditures between men and women. Health care costs vary by more than just gender, and sophisticated risk adjustment models consider factors like age, geography, health status, tobacco use, and family size. However, these models do not fully explain the differences in expected health care spending. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage (MA or Medicare Part C) and how these payments are risk adjusted. The report also discusses how risk scores for MA enrollees are initially generated and change over time. Medicare Advantage provides private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B, with CMS paying private health plans and adjusting payments based on risk scores. The report discusses how risk scores are generated and change over time, along with CMS audits on risk-adjusted payments and potential issues with risk adjustment and audits. The report discusses how CMS audits risk-adjusted MA payments and potential issues with risk adjustment. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, with health plans receiving capitated monthly payments adjusted for demographics and health status. The plan assumes financial risk regardless of the services used by beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage plans provide all required Medicare benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries in return for a monthly payment adjusted for demographics and health status. The plan is at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are less than payments. Payments are based on each plan's estimated cost relative to the maximum amount the government will pay. Medicare Advantage plans receive payments based on their estimated costs compared to the government's maximum payment amount. Plans submit bids reflecting their cost estimates for covering an average beneficiary, including administrative costs and profit. If a plan's bid exceeds the benchmark, it receives a base rate equal to the benchmark. Medicare Advantage plans submit bids based on their cost estimates for covering an average beneficiary, including administrative costs and profit. If a plan's bid is above the benchmark, it receives a base rate equal to the benchmark; if below, it receives a base rate equal to its bid. CMS adjusts payments to private plans based on the characteristics of enrolled Medicare beneficiaries. CMS adjusts payments to private Medicare Advantage plans based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries, such as age, gender, and health history. The current risk adjustment methodology uses demographic and health factors to adjust payments to plans. The current Medicare Advantage (MA) risk adjustment methodology adjusts payments to plans based on beneficiary characteristics like age, gender, and health history. CMS uses demographic and health factors from a base year to estimate next year's healthcare expenditures for beneficiaries. CMS determines risk adjustment for MA plan payments based on beneficiary demographic and health factors from a base year. Factors such as age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability are considered in estimating healthcare expenditures for the following year. The risk adjustment for MA plan payments considers factors like age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. Health status is determined through diagnosis using the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical. The process of incorporating health status into Medicare payments involves using ICD-9-CM codes to diagnose signs, symptoms, injuries, diseases, and conditions for reimbursement. Physicians have been required to submit these codes since 1988, with over 13,000 codes currently in use. ICD-9-CM codes are used for Medicare reimbursement since 1988, with over 13,000 codes currently in use. The codes are hierarchical, with only the most significant manifestation of a disease coded for payment purposes. ICD-9-CM codes are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories, with a hierarchy imposed on them for payment purposes. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, ranging from Acute Myocardial Infarction to Coronary Atherosclerosis/Other Chronic Ischemic Heart Disease. Hierarchical coding in ICD-9-CM ensures that a person with a code in a higher severity category is excluded from lower severity categories, even if codes grouping into those categories are present. For example, a person with codes in both Unstable Angina and Angina Pectoris/Old Myocardial Infarction is coded for the higher severity category. Hierarchical coding in ICD-9-CM ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement. Only 70 out of 189 hierarchical condition codes are used in the current CMS model, predicting Medicare expenditures for the following year. Hierarchical coding in ICD-9-CM determines reimbursement based on the most costly disease. Currently, 70 out of 189 HCCs are used to predict Medicare expenses. In 2012, 87 HCC codes will be included in the model. Figure 2 illustrates the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes to HCC codes for a 76-year-old female with various diagnosed conditions. In 2012, 87 HCC codes will be incorporated into the model for Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures. Figure 2 shows how ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes for a 76-year-old female with multiple diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC code. The woman has multiple diagnosed conditions, including acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, chronic bronchitis/emphysema, renal failure, chest pain, and an ankle sprain. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC code, as shown in Figure 2. Some conditions map to one of the 189 HCCs. The woman's diagnoses do not all result in an HCC code, as some conditions are excluded from the CMS model if they are not chronic or short-term illnesses. These models aim to predict future expenditures, so conditions that are fleeting or not good predictors are not captured. The CMS model excludes certain conditions like pain and ankle sprain that do not map to HCCs and are not chronic. Short-term illnesses are also not considered as they are not good predictors of future expenditures. The model uses the highest code in a related disease category and adds risk factors across unrelated categories. For example, a 76-year-old female's total risk score is the sum of individual risk factors estimated for each condition. The model is additive, using the highest code in a related disease category and adding risk factors across unrelated categories. For example, a 76-year-old female's total risk score is the sum of individual risk factors estimated for each condition, which is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment. This results in a total estimated annual payment of $11,810. The risk score (1.583) is calculated by summing individual risk factors and considering disease hierarchy. It is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment, resulting in an estimated annual payment of $11,810. Interaction effects of multiple conditions can lead to higher costs, such as with diabetes and congestive heart failure. Empirical studies have shown that interaction effects between certain diseases can result in higher healthcare costs. For example, individuals with both diabetes and congestive heart failure incur higher costs than expected by simply adding the costs of each condition. Additionally, there are interaction effects between disability and diabetes, leading to increased healthcare costs for individuals with both conditions. The costs of congestive heart failure and diabetes are higher than expected due to interaction effects between certain diseases and disability. CMS has incorporated these interactions into the CMS-HCC model for adjusting payments to MA plans. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between certain diseases, disability, and demographic variables. The model uses a linear regression approach with expenditures predicted by diagnoses and demographic factors, including interactions. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between certain diseases, disability, and demographic variables using a linear regression approach with expenditures predicted by diagnoses and demographic factors. The model includes interactions between diseases and permanent disability, and is based on actual claims data for original Medicare Parts A and B. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between diseases, disability, and demographic variables using actual claims data for original Medicare Parts A and B. The model's results can be standardized to equate risk scores to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries' average costs. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between diseases, disability, and demographic variables using actual claims data for original Medicare Parts A and B. The model recalculates coefficients periodically using current data, standardizing risk scores to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between diseases, disability, and demographic variables using actual claims data for original Medicare Parts A and B. Risk scores can be standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries, allowing CMS to individualize payments based on health status and demographics. CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on risk scores that reflect health status and demographics. These scores help individualize payments to reflect likely costs for treating beneficiaries, rather than predicting individual expenditures. The CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on risk scores reflecting health status and demographics, not to predict individual expenditures but to estimate average expenditure variations. Risk scores for MA enrollees are attributed based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses for new enrollees. For new Medicare Advantage enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility in the previous year, rates are determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not diagnoses. Non-new enrollees include those switching plans or with 12 months of Part B eligibility. CMS collects data from MA plans for risk scoring. CMS collects information from Medicare Advantage plans to periodically update the risk score of each beneficiary enrolled in MA, using the Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS). Historically, diagnostic information was primarily provided by physician claims, but CMS is transitioning to encounter level data. This data is used for non-new enrollees, including those switching MA plans or with at least 12 months of Part B eligibility in the previous year, to determine rates based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses. Advantage plans now use the Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries. Data includes dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes for accurate risk assessment. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1. The Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) is used by Advantage plans to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1, based on data that include dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes. The data used for risk-adjusted payments are always from a prior 12-month period, with no diagnosis data reported in the service year affecting payment adjustments. The risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments are updated twice a year on January 1 and July 1, based on data from a prior 12-month period. Errors in payment calculations can stem from age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease information. Demographic and eligibility data are sourced from administrative files, while health status data comes from plans submitting diagnoses to CMS. Error in risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments can stem from inaccuracies in age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease information. Plans are responsible for providing accurate health status data to CMS for payment justification, which is auditable. CMS conducts audits to ensure data accuracy and prevent errors in payment calculations. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans to verify the accuracy of risk-adjusted payments claimed by plans, ensuring that payments are supported by medical records (RADV audits). Previously, audits only aimed to recover payment errors for sampled enrollees, but now audits are more comprehensive. In February 2011, CMS proposed to extrapolate RADV error rates to entire Medicare Advantage plan contracts, aiming to save $2.27 billion over five years. This followed the release of a methodology for auditing plan data and identifying payment errors in December 2010. In February 2012, CMS finalized the methodology for auditing Medicare Advantage plan data and extrapolating payment errors, aiming to recover larger amounts from plans. CMS finalized the methodology for auditing Medicare Advantage plan data in February 2012. Audits are conducted at the contract level, with plans likely to push back as CMS seeks to recover larger amounts. The three-step audit process includes sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment. The audits for Medicare Advantage plans are likely to be more aggressive, causing potential issues for some Part C plans. CMS conducts audits at the contract level using a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. Samples are used to reduce data burden, with 201 enrollees considered a sufficient sample size. CMS uses samples for audits of Medicare Advantage plans to reduce data burden. 201 enrollees are considered a sufficient sample size, drawn from eligible beneficiaries enrolled in the contract in January of the payment year. Enrollees must meet specific criteria, including continuous enrollment in the same MA contract for 12 months and non-ESRD status. Medicare beneficiaries must meet specific criteria to be eligible for audits of Medicare Advantage plans, including continuous enrollment in the same MA contract for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, full Medicare Part B coverage, and a diagnosis of at least one risk adjustment diagnosis. Eligible enrollees for audits of Medicare Advantage plans must have continuous enrollment in the same MA contract for 12 months, full Medicare Part B coverage, and at least one risk adjustment diagnosis leading to CMS-HCC assignment. The validation HCCs for sampled enrollees are based on risk adjustment data submitted by plans. Enrollees are divided into three groups for sampling, with 67 each from the highest, lowest, and middle risk score groups. The goal is to sample 201 eligible enrollees divided into three groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 enrollees randomly drawn from the highest, lowest, and middle risk score groups. Sampling weights ensure representation of each group. The final group of 67 enrollees is randomly selected from the lowest risk scores. Sampling weights are used to ensure representation of each group, with each sampled enrollee assigned a weight of 14.925 for scaling up the sample payment error findings to the population. The sample of eligible enrollees to be audited is divided into three equal groups representing high, medium, and low strata. An equal number of enrollees are randomly selected from each group with a weight of 14.925 assigned to each sampled enrollee. Enrollee sampling weights are used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the population. The MA plan is informed of the audited enrollees and their HCC codes, and is required to provide evidence from medical records to substantiate each HCC code they were paid for within 12 weeks. The MA plan is directed to reproduce and deliver evidence from medical records to substantiate HCC codes for audited enrollees. Plans have 12 weeks to provide medical records for sampled enrollees, which are reviewed to confirm the diagnosis for risk-adjusted payments. The MA plan must provide medical records within 12 weeks to confirm diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments. If the records confirm the diagnosis, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Plans can appeal findings to CMS for review. The MA plan must provide medical records within 12 weeks to confirm diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments. If the records confirm the diagnosis, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Plans can appeal findings to CMS for review. The final decision is binding unless the plan requests a review by the CMS Administrator. CMS notes that payment errors for each enrollee can be positive (net overpayment) or negative (net underpayment), based on the first medical record that validates the audited CMS-HCC. The CMS Administrator's review is binding unless requested by the MA plan. Payment errors can be positive or negative based on the first medical record validating audited CMS-HCC. Underpayments cannot be supported by submitting additional medical records. Enrollee-level payment errors are corrected based on supported HCCs from RADV medical record reviews. Payment errors can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment) and are calculated for each sampled enrollee. The corrected risk scores are used to calculate payment errors for each sampled enrollee in the MA selected contract. Payment errors can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment) and are determined based on the enrollee's enrollment duration and sampling weight. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The weighted enrollee payment errors are then summed to determine the MA contract's estimated payment error. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The weighted enrollee payment errors are then summed to determine the MA contract's estimated payment error. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract will be determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, modified by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster to address methodological concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. The payment error calculation for MA contracts involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review. Errors identified during the audit are used to establish the total error in payment for each enrollee, which is then extrapolated to the contract. The fee-for-service adjuster is applied to address concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. In the \"Concerns with CMS Audit Process\" section, the payment error calculation involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review. Errors identified during the audit are used to establish the total error in payment for each enrollee, which is then extrapolated to the contract. The estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50. The payment error calculation involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review. Errors are identified and extrapolated to the contract, with an estimated plan level error of $1,187.50. A 99% confidence interval is then calculated for the estimated plan error. The estimated plan error is $1,187.50, with a 99% confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. If the interval includes $0, the recovery amount is $0. The error in payment to the hypothetical plan is estimated to be at least $1,037.50 with a certainty of over 99%. The recovery amount is constrained to $0 if the 99% confidence interval includes or is below $0. If the interval does not include $0, a fee-for-service adjuster modifies the lower bound to determine the reimbursement amount to the government, with the recovery amount capped at $0 if it would result in a negative recovery. The RADV audit results will not lead to additional payments to MA plans. Recent academic studies and preliminary research by MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. The distribution of actual costs for beneficiaries with the same HCC code varies, leading to potential discrepancies in Medicare reimbursements to plans. The RADV audit results will not result in additional payments to MA plans. Recent academic studies and MedPAC's research have raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage. Medicare reimburses plans based on the average cost of treating beneficiaries with the same HCC code. Plans may manipulate screening efforts to enroll beneficiaries who are below average cost. Plans may manipulate screening efforts to enroll beneficiaries who are below average cost, leading to below average expenses while being reimbursed at rates established for average beneficiaries. MedPAC is concerned about some Medicare Advantage plans enrolling beneficiaries with below average costs. MedPAC is concerned about Medicare Advantage plans enrolling beneficiaries with below average costs, potentially leading to below average expenses while being reimbursed at rates set for average beneficiaries. Stakeholders have expressed concerns about the audit and the reimbursement of high-cost individuals in certain plans. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process and reimbursement of high-cost individuals in certain Medicare Advantage plans, including special needs plans and PACE plans. MedPAC and Brown et al. have differing views on improving the CMS risk adjustment model. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process for Medicare fee-for-service data used in risk adjustments, highlighting potential errors in the methodology and premium adjustments not reflecting actual enrollee risk profiles. The American Academy of Actuaries raised concerns about the audit process for Medicare fee-for-service data used in risk adjustments. They noted potential errors in the methodology and highlighted that the resulting premiums may not accurately reflect the risk profiles of actual enrollees. The inconsistency between the development and application of risk adjustment factors was a primary concern, as the data used for estimation was not validated for accuracy. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply these factors only to MA data that are validated, creating a discrepancy between the data used in the RADV audit and the risk adjustment model. The proposed audit process would only apply validated MA data to determine payment errors, creating a discrepancy with the FFS data used to develop risk adjustment factors. This could lead to inadequate payments if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic in the RADV audit but were in the FFS data. The RADV audit may result in inadequate payments for diabetic members if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic, leading to understated risk scores. This discrepancy could affect the total payments for those with diabetes. The inconsistency in data validation for diabetic patients may lead to inadequate payments and systematic underpayment, creating uncertainty and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency in applying factors to substantiated data, potentially leading to underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system. Extrapolating RADV payment-error calculations for MA plans could result in a significant change in the payment methodology. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency in applying factors to substantiated data, potentially leading to underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system. The notice of final calculation methodology added a fee-for-service adjustment to the final recovery amount, which may address concerns about the risk adjustment methodology for MA plans. The final calculation methodology for MA plans added a fee-for-service adjustment to address concerns about the risk adjustment system. This adjustment aims to compensate plans for enrolling sicker or healthier beneficiaries, but there are still issues with under or overcompensation for certain plans. More information on the fee-for-service adjuster is expected. Risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage plans aims to compensate for enrolling sicker or healthier beneficiaries, but concerns remain about under or overcompensation. Using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients has raised methodological concerns, with some plans worried about financial risks from RADV audits. The Secretary's approach to addressing these concerns remains to be seen. The use of Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients in Medicare Advantage plans has raised concerns about accuracy and financial risks from RADV audits. The Secretary's approach to addressing these methodological concerns remains to be seen. Appendix A provides a history of Part C risk adjustment payments to private plans under Medicare, detailing the different models used to calculate risk adjustment. The models have evolved in complexity and explanatory power over the years. Table A-1 shows the various risk adjustment models, the years they were in use, and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The appendix briefly describes risk adjustment models used for Medicare private plan payments. Table A-1 shows the models, years in use, and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The R2 measures how well a model explains beneficiary expenditure variations. Individual Medicare spending can range from $0 for healthy beneficiaries to hundreds of thousands for very ill beneficiaries. The R2 is a measure of how well a model explains beneficiary expenditure variations in Medicare. It quantifies the model's ability to predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics, ranging from 0 (no explanation) to 1 (perfect prediction). The R2 quantifies how well models predict beneficiary spending in Medicare, with values ranging from 0 to 1. The AAPCC model has an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of expenditure variation. Subsequent models have increased this percentage, with the most recent proposed model showing improved prediction capabilities. The AAPCC model in Table A-1 predicts beneficiary expenditures with an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of the variation. CMS's latest model can explain around 12.5% of expenditure variation. Prior to 2000, private plan payments were risk-adjusted for demographic factors. The most recent model can explain approximately 12.5% of expenditure variation. Prior to 2000, private plan payments were risk-adjusted for demographic factors including age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These demographic variables explain less than 1% of the variation. The demographic variables in the AAPCC model, including age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status, explain less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. The model does not account for beneficiary health costs or adjust for enrolling very ill beneficiaries. Private plan enrollees are generally healthier than original Medicare enrollees. The demographic data in the AAPCC model explain less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. Private plan enrollees are healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by 2000. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by 2000, which led to the use of the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model from 2000 to 2003. This model considered beneficiary health status and the worst principal inpatient diagnosis for hospital admissions. From 2000 to 2003, CMS utilized the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model, which factored in the worst principal inpatient diagnosis for hospital admissions. The PIP-DCG model explained more of the variation in Medicare expenditures compared to the AAPCC model, but had limitations such as not counting illnesses with high expenditures that did not lead to hospital admissions. Efforts to reduce hospital admissions could potentially lower risk-adjusted costs. The PIP-DCG model explained more Medicare expenditure variation than the AAPCC model but had limitations. Illnesses with high costs not leading to hospital admissions were not included. Efforts to reduce hospital admissions could lower risk-adjusted payments. The phase-in schedule for the PIP-DCG model was held at 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method through 2003 to soften the financial impact on M+C organizations. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were based on the CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) model. The PIP-DCG model was phased-in with a schedule of 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method through 2003 to soften the financial impact on M+C organizations. In 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) model, which considers severity of illness. In 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which considers severity of illness and explains nearly 10% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness and explains nearly 10% of expenditure variation. Version 12 of the model is updated annually to reflect changes in diagnosis codes. The CMS-HCC model, which adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness, explains nearly 10% of expenditure variation. Version 12 is updated annually to reflect changes in diagnosis codes, with the latest update increasing the explained variation to nearly 11%. Version 21 includes updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model was recalibrated with more recent diagnosis and expenditure data, increasing the predictive power to approximately 12.5%. This version also underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. It is slated to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices, increasing its predictive power to approximately 12.5%. It is scheduled to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
