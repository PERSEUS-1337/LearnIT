    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act for over five years. The Act authorizes various specific Indian Health Service programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes specific IHS programs such as health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Authorizations for IHCIA programs expired in FY2001, but Congress continues to appropriate funds for them. Major changes to IHCIA have been suggested by Indian health proponents, but some have not been accepted by HHS or other stakeholders. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes specific IHS programs and other health insurance programs. Authorizations for IHCIA programs expired in FY2001, but Congress continues to appropriate funds for them. Major changes to IHCIA have been suggested by Indian health proponents, leading to ongoing negotiations and reauthorization bills through the 106th-109th Congresses. Negotiations for the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) have been ongoing through the 106th-109th Congresses. Several bills have been introduced, including S. 1057 and H.R. 5312 in the Senate, and S. 3524 in the Senate Finance Committee. A House bill (H.R. 5312) similar to S. 1057 was referred to House committees and ordered reported by the Resources Committee. A Senate Finance Committee bill, S. 3524, amending the Social Security Act for Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP, was reported by the Committee. Congress faces a multi-billion-dollar problem with Indian trust funds due to federal mismanagement. The federal government's mismanagement of Indian trust funds has led to financial claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes, with claims totaling as much as $176 billion. This issue has also resulted in the controversial reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians. The mismanagement of Indian trust funds and lands has resulted in financial claims against the United States totaling $176 billion by Indian individuals and tribes. This issue has led to the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians. Trust lands amount to 56 million acres, with an asset value of $3.3 billion, mostly held for tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has managed trust funds, lands, and assets for Indian tribes and individuals totaling 56 million acres. The funds' total value is $3.3 billion, with $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The Treasury Department oversees the accounts and makes payments to beneficiaries. The BIA has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds, with investigations revealing various problems. The Treasury Department holds $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has been criticized for its management of trust lands and funds, leading to the enactment of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted to address issues with the Bureau of Indian Affairs' management of trust lands and funds. This led to the creation of the Office of the Special Trustee (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. Subsequently, IIM account holders filed a class action suit demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. The 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act led to the creation of the Office of the Special Trustee (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. Subsequently, IIM account holders filed a class action suit demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. This has resulted in the reorganization of the BIA and OST, along with congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims related to trust fund and lands mismanagement. The class action suit (Cobell v. Norton) demanded an accounting and correction of fund mismanagement by the DOI and Treasury. This led to the reorganization of the BIA and OST, as well as congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims related to trust fund mismanagement. The district court found breaches in trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and staffing for trust management. DOI and Treasury were ordered to bring trust management up to current standards. In the first stage of the Cobell case, the district court found that DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and staffing for trust management. They were ordered to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage will determine the amount of money owed to the IIM plaintiffs. The final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money owed to the IIM plaintiffs. DOI proposed a historical accounting method to reconcile trust account transactions, estimating losses in the tens of millions, while the plaintiffs proposed using databases to estimate total losses. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to conduct a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, estimating compliance costs at $12-13 billion. DOI's method estimated losses in the tens of millions, while the plaintiffs' method showed losses of over $100 billion. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, with estimated compliance costs of $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the district court's orders. DOI continues with its historical accounting plan, while Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the district court's order for a historical accounting of IIM trust account transactions. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. Congress has addressed the Cobell lawsuit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. Concerns exist about the costs of the lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation and funding for other Indian programs. No bills have been introduced to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. Congress has not introduced any bills to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. Concerns persist about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation and funding for other Indian programs, including ongoing litigation expenses and potential future costs. Possible future costs for the ongoing Cobell lawsuit include $12-$13 billion for court-ordered historical accounting, a settlement amount proposed by Cobell plaintiffs, and estimated IIM account debts of over $100 billion. Funding sources may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" which some senior appropriators believe may be insufficient for a settlement. The ongoing Cobell lawsuit may incur future costs of $12-$13 billion for court-ordered historical accounting and over $100 billion in estimated IIM account debts. Funding sources could include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" which some senior appropriators deem insufficient for a settlement. Congress has introduced two settlement bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, to address these issues. Congress has introduced two settlement bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund for distribution to IIM claimants and to review Indian trust asset management. The introduced bills aim to establish a fund for IIM claimants, create a commission to review trust asset management, increase payments for individual Indian trust interests, and require audits of all trust funds. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 in July. The bills aim to establish a fund for IIM claimants, create a commission to review trust asset management, increase payments for individual Indian trust interests, and require audits of all trust funds. Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 in July and March 2006. H.R. 4322 awaits further committee action. Senate Indian Affairs Committee mark-up of an amended S. 1439, with a settlement amount of $8 billion, was scheduled for August 2 but withdrawn. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 in July and March 2006, along with the House Resources Committee on March 1, 2006. H.R. 4322 is pending further committee action. A mark-up of an amended S. 1439 with an $8 billion settlement was scheduled but withdrawn for more negotiations on trust management reform. DOI, BIA, and OST have proposed changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act. The $8 billion settlement for IIM land and funds mismanagement claims was scheduled for August 2 but withdrawn for further negotiations. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made administrative changes since the 1994 Act, including transferring trust fund management from BIA to OST in 1996. In April 2003, a reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services at the regional and agency levels. The 1996 transfer of trust fund management from BIA to OST was a significant change in trust management reform. In April 2003, a reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services at regional and agency levels, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the current reorganization, citing insufficient consultation. The reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services at regional and agency levels, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing insufficient consultation. The DOI reorganization faced opposition from tribes due to insufficient consultation and undefined new OST duties. Despite claims of prior consultation and a court-ordered deadline, attempts to stop the reorganization in Congress have failed. Previous bills proposing changes in trust management have not advanced, but S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to address these issues. Recent Congresses have failed to pass bills proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to reorganize DOI's management of Indian trust assets, with S. 1439 potentially being marked up pending negotiations. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA; P.L. 100-497) was enacted to regulate gambling on Indian reservations and other lands, with the goal of tribes using gaming revenues for tribal purposes. H.R. 4322 and S. 1439 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations, aiming for tribes to use gaming revenues for tribal development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for certain tribes and circumstances. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) aims for tribes to use gaming revenues for tribal economic development and governmental programs. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for certain tribes and circumstances, critics argue that these exceptions allow for \"reservation shopping\" and undermine the Act. Critics argue that exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allow for \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development. Bills introduced to address this issue delete the exception requiring secretarial and gubernatorial agreement. Two bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to address exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that allow for \"reservation shopping\" and hinder on-reservation economic development. These bills eliminate the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed. H.R. 4893 also includes a geographic limitation on lands related to the tribe. Exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes are retained with some restrictions. Both bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to address exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by eliminating the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement. Applications filed before specific dates are allowed to proceed, with H.R. 4893 adding a geographic limitation on lands related to the tribe. Exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes are retained with restrictions. H.R. 4893 repeals the land claim exception and adds a new exception for tribes landless on the date of its enactment. The bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to address exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by eliminating the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement. H.R. 4893 adds a new exception for tribes landless on the date of its enactment, with limitations and mitigation agreements. Opponents argue that the bills impose new burdens on tribes and that the requirement for mitigation agreements in H.R. 4893 is unprecedented. Opponents of the bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, argue that they add new and unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. They also criticize the requirement for mitigation agreements in H.R. 4893 as an unprecedented subjection of tribal sovereignty to local governments. H.R. 4893 failed to pass in the House on September 13. (For more information, see CRS Report RS21499, Indian Gaming Regulatory Act: Gaming on Newly Acquired Lands.) Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawaii, are not currently considered. The bill H.R. 4893, which failed to pass in the House on September 13, includes a requirement for mitigation agreements seen as a threat to tribal sovereignty. Native Hawaiians, not recognized as Indians under federal law, lack a political entity recognized by the federal government. Congress has authorized federal programs for Native Hawaiians. Native Hawaiians, not considered Indians under federal law, lack a recognized political entity like Indian tribes. Congress has authorized federal programs for Native Hawaiians, but the absence of recognition poses a threat to these programs. Congressional action is needed for Native Hawaiian recognition. The absence of a recognized political entity for Native Hawaiians endangers federal and state programs, leading to legal challenges claiming the programs are race-based. Congressional action is required for a Native Hawaiian political entity to be recognized, with three bills in the 109th Congress aiming to establish this recognition process. Questions regarding governmental powers and lands are left for future negotiations and legislation. Three bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity. The bills defer questions about governmental powers and lands for future negotiations and legislation. Arguments for and against the bills are summarized, with proponents citing Congress's constitutional authority over commerce. The 109th Congress has three bills aiming to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, with arguments for and against the bills summarized. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over commerce with indigenous peoples in the US. They also point to the special relationship Congress has with Native Hawaiians through established programs. Proponents argue that Congress has the authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity based on its constitutional power over commerce with indigenous peoples in the US. They highlight the special relationship Congress has with Native Hawaiians through established programs like the Hawaiian homelands program. The Hawaiian homelands program, established in 1921, reserves certain public lands for lease only to Native Hawaiians. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians had sovereignty forcibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and like Indian tribes, they have maintained a claim to sovereignty. In 1893, Americans in Hawaii led the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, resulting in the loss of sovereignty for Native Hawaiians. The new Republic of Hawaii agreed to U.S. annexation in 1898. Some argue that Congress does not have the authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, arguing it extends only to Indian tribes. They also question the special responsibility the United States has towards Native Hawaiians compared to Indian tribes, and argue that recognition would be based on race alone. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it would be based on race alone and set a precedent for other non-Indian groups. They also question the special responsibility towards Native Hawaiians compared to Indian tribes. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it would set a precedent for other non-Indian groups and raise concerns about racial discrimination. They also dispute claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, questioning the historical basis for it. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue against the passage of S. 147 due to concerns of racial discrimination and dispute claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, citing historical arguments. Bills similar to S. 147 have been considered in previous Congresses, with S. 147 being reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005. Sovereignty resided in the monarch, not the Native Hawaiian people, and ended with the 1893 overthrow. Bills similar to S. 147 and H.R. 309 were considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005. S. 3064, an amended version of S. 147, failed to proceed in the Senate in 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee. The bill introduced on May 25, 2006, was based on discussions among congressional offices, the Administration, and the state of Hawaii. The Senate failed to proceed with considering S. 147 and S. 3064. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309 on July 19, 2005."
