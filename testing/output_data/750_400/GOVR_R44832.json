    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid rise in retail drug spending. This increase is attributed to manufacturers introducing new drugs and raising prices for existing brand-name products. Additionally, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection has resulted in lower savings from generic substitutes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. Retail drug spending is expected to continue rising due to new drug introductions and price increases for existing brand-name products. The slower rate of brand-name drugs losing patent protection has led to reduced savings from generic substitutes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services forecast a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other areas of medical spending. Retail drug spending is projected to increase at a 6.3% annual growth rate from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other areas of medical spending. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. References to more detailed CRS products and relevant congressional hearings are provided in the appendix. The report covers federally funded research, regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation in the context of prescription drug topics. It references more detailed CRS products and relevant congressional hearings in the appendix. Data on prescription drug spending is commonly sourced from the National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts compiled by CMS, tracking annual spending by all payers in retail settings. The National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts compiled by CMS track annual spending on prescription drugs in retail settings. The data exclude drugs dispensed in institutions and over-the-counter products. In 2016, the US spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs, with a projected $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of total healthcare spending. According to recent NHE data, the United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of total healthcare spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to about 11% of national healthcare spending by 2027. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total healthcare expenditures since 1960. Prescription drug spending in the United States is projected to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, representing 10% of total healthcare spending. By 2027, it is expected to increase to about 11% of national healthcare spending. Retail drug spending has been between 5% to 10% of total healthcare expenditures since 1960. However, some analysts believe that the data on retail drug sales do not provide a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use. National estimates of prescription drug spending vary due to different assumptions about rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use. National estimates of prescription drug spending vary due to different assumptions about rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Private consultants and academics also publish forecasts of U.S. prescription drug spending, showing a trend towards higher spending in recent years. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the decades. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the decades, with growth slowing from 2003 through 2013 to a historically low average annual rate of 5%. This moderation in spending growth was influenced by factors such as the economic recession from 2007 to 2010 and a decrease in the number of expensive new drugs. Retail drug spending growth slowed from 2003 to 2013, with an average annual rate of 5%. This was influenced by factors such as the economic recession and a decrease in expensive new drugs. However, in 2014, spending accelerated with a 12.4% increase, the largest in over a decade. Retail drug spending growth slowed from 2003 to 2013 due to economic factors and a decrease in expensive new drugs. However, in 2014, spending accelerated with a 12.4% increase, the largest in over a decade. Drug spending rose by 8.9% in 2015 before slowing down in subsequent years. Retail drug spending is projected to grow by about 6.3% a year on average through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail drug spending rose by 8.9% in 2015, slowed to 1.3% in 2016, and is forecasted to increase by 2.9% in 2017. The growth is projected to average 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than that of physician services and hospital care. Retail drug spending is projected to increase by 2.9% in 2017 and grow at an average rate of 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster price growth for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than that of physician services and hospital care. Hearings have been held on prescription drugs in response to the acceleration in spending and sharp increases in prices for specific drugs. Retail prescription drug spending has been a focus in hearings due to the rise in prices and spending, driven by new high-cost drugs, price increases, and fewer generic substitutions. The rapid increase in retail drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven by new high-cost drugs, price increases, and less generic substitution. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also contributed to the rise in drug demand. Prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 despite increased utilization, attributed to fewer new drug approvals and less use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to factors like fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and a deceleration in spending for diabetes treatment drugs. Drug mix, which compares the cost of new drugs to older ones, also played a role in the overall decrease in spending. New brand-name drugs are typically more expensive than older ones and may not have cheaper alternatives, while newly introduced generic drugs are a more cost-effective option. In 2016, prescription drug spending slowed due to factors like fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and a deceleration in spending for diabetes treatment drugs. The cost of new drugs versus older ones, known as drug mix, also contributed to the decrease in spending. The FDA approved many expensive specialty drugs for conditions like hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, leading to increased prescription drug costs. Generic drugs, less expensive than brand-name products, can reduce the cost of therapies. FDA approved many new expensive specialty drugs for conditions like hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, leading to increased prescription drug costs. Hepatitis C drugs played a significant role in increased drug spending in recent years. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs significantly increased U.S. prescription drug spending, accounting for a large portion of the growth in 2014 and 2015. However, the impact of these expensive drugs is decreasing as fewer new patients are treated and prices drop. New generic substitution had a smaller role in reducing costs compared to the expensive specialty drugs approved by the FDA. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs significantly increased U.S. prescription drug spending in 2014 and 2015. However, the impact of these expensive drugs is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated and prices drop. Generic substitution played a smaller role in reducing costs compared to specialty drugs. Patents expiring for best-selling brand-name drugs led to the production of new generic versions, resulting in a $32.6 billion decrease in spending in 2012. Since 2009, patents for best-selling brand-name drugs have expired, leading to the production of generic versions and a $32.6 billion decrease in spending in 2012. Changes in drug mix, particularly the rise of biologics with high introductory prices, will continue to impact spending. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some drugs. Annual savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased. Changes in drug mix, especially the rise of high-priced biologics, will impact spending. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some drugs, but prices continue to rise faster than overall inflation. The FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for biologics losing patent protection, but prices remain high. Prescription drug prices have outpaced overall inflation since 2014, with a significant narrowing of the gap in 2017. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017, with U.S. retail drug inflation at 6.4% in 2014, 6.2% in 2016, and 2.8% in 2017. Drug inflation is driven by price increases for brand-name and generic drugs. Drug inflation in the U.S. retail sector was 6.4% in 2014, 6.2% in 2016, and 2.8% in 2017, driven by price increases for brand-name and generic drugs. Manufacturers raised prices for existing brand-name and generic drugs, while new innovator brand-name drugs also contributed to the inflation. However, a 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major factor in inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed that average prices for commonly used brand-name drugs rose by 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while average prices for generic drugs declined by 8.7% during the same period. In 2016, a HHS study found that generic price increases did not significantly contribute to inflation. Express Scripts analysis revealed that average prices for common brand-name drugs increased by 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices decreased by 8.7% during the same period. Biologics and specialty drugs were key drivers of price inflation in the brand-name drug category. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage since 2014 has boosted demand for prescription drugs. Biologics and specialty drugs have driven much of the price inflation in the brand-name drug category. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand for prescription drugs, with a nearly 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015. Medicaid coverage also expanded under the ACA. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage led to a 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015. Medicaid coverage also expanded under the ACA, contributing to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging of the baby boomers has also increased demand for prescription drugs. The ACA expansion increased drug coverage for non-elderly, low-income individuals. In 2014, Medicaid changes led to an 8% rise in prescription drug claims and a 20% increase in spending. The aging baby boomers also drove up demand, with patients aged 50 and older accounting for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. In 2016, patients aged 50 and older made up 70% of dispensed prescriptions and 77% of the increase in drug dispensing since 2011. Out-of-pocket spending for filled prescriptions decreased from 57% in 1990 to 13.2% in 2017, with commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs covering the majority of drug spending. Out-of-pocket spending for filled prescriptions has decreased significantly over the years, accounting for 13.2% of drug spending in 2017. Commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs now cover the majority of the nation's retail prescription drug bill. Despite this shift, consumers may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on the type of drugs prescribed. In 2026, out-of-pocket spending is forecast to account for 12.1% of retail drug costs, with health plans imposing higher cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending. Consumers may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on the specific drugs prescribed and their insurance coverage. Health plans are increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs, with a rise in drug deductibles from 2012 to 2015. Formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance are becoming more common, especially in health plans on ACA state exchanges. The share of commercial health plans with a prescription drug deductible increased from 23% to 46% between 2012 and 2015. Formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance are more prevalent, especially in ACA state exchange plans, imposing a greater financial burden on consumers. Tiered pricing in health plans involves different cost-sharing structures for drugs, with consumers facing higher costs for expensive specialty drugs compared to generic ones. The widening price differential between tiers has increased financial burden on consumers. For example, in 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans paid an average co-payment of $110 for high-priced tier-four drugs, compared to $11 for tier-one generic drugs. The cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by other factors, such as the ACA's cap on out-of-pocket expenses. The financial burden on consumers using higher-priced drugs has increased due to tiered pricing in health plans. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored plans paid $110 for tier-four drugs compared to $11 for generic drugs. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by the ACA's cap on out-of-pocket expenses and pharmaceutical manufacturers offering patient assistance programs. The ACA has capped annual out-of-pocket spending in health plans and reduced cost sharing for Part D enrollees. Pharmaceutical manufacturers offer patient assistance through discount coupons and assistance programs. Generic drug use rates have increased, leading to a decline in average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs. However, some insured consumers still face high out-of-pocket costs. According to recent studies, average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased in the past few years. However, the number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs, especially those with serious conditions or prescribed specialty drugs, has increased. In 2014, the average out-of-pocket spending for enrollees in large employer-sponsored health plans was $144, down from $167 in 2009. Despite this decrease, nearly 3% of enrollees had out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with nearly 3% of enrollees facing out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. Median out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rose from $24 to $35 per month for those costing $600 or more per month. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, forecasted to dip to $137 in 2017 and gradually increase to $207. Specialty drug costs rose from $24 to $35 per month for drugs costing $600 or more per month, while nonspecialty drug costs declined from $14 to $6 per month. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, forecasted to dip to $137 in 2017 and gradually increase to $207 by 2026. This decrease is expected to continue as a share of retail drug expenditures due to slower rise in overall U.S. retail drug spending. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, forecasted to dip to $137 in 2017 and gradually increase to $207 by 2026. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending rose from about 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017 due to expanded subsidized drug coverage. The government has increased its share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, with a forecasted rise to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits or setting drug prices. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased from 25% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2017, with a projected increase to 47% by 2026. Unlike many other countries, the United States does not have a centralized system for managing government-sponsored drug benefits or setting drug prices. Various federal health programs operate different drug discount and contracting systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D, direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration, and a combination of mandatory rebates and negotiations in Medicaid. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs. Federal agencies overseeing federal health programs operate various drug discount and contracting systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D, direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration, and a combination of mandatory rebates and negotiations in Medicaid. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs but does not have the authority to set drug prices. Price discounts for prescription drugs vary widely among federal programs. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs but lacks the authority to set drug prices. Federal agencies can secure significant discounts for prescription drugs through various systems, with price discounts varying widely among different programs. Medicaid rebates were substantial, equaling 47% of Medicaid spending in 2012, while Part D rebates were smaller at 15% that same year. Legislation has been proposed to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate drug prices. According to a 2015 HHS Office of Inspector General report, Medicaid rebates were 47% of Medicaid spending in 2012, while only 15% of Part D spending. Some Medicaid rebates were over 10 times larger than Part D rebates for the same drugs. Legislation has been introduced to empower the HHS Secretary to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. The HHS Secretary may be given more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers and contract with retail pharmacies to dispense drugs to enrollees at set reimbursement rates. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 created this system to bolster market competition. The Medicare Part D program involves commercial health payers competing for enrollees based on drug coverage. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers and contract with pharmacies. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations between plan sponsors, manufacturers, and pharmacies. The Medicare Part D program, created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, includes a \"noninterference provision\" that prevents the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations between plan sponsors, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs, with total Part D drug rebates increasing from 9.6% in 2007 to a forecasted 24% in 2018. The market-based model for controlling drug prices in the Medicare Part D program has been debated. Program spending has been below budget projections, with drug rebates increasing from 9.6% in 2007 to a projected 24% in 2018. A 2014 CBO study found lower premiums in areas with more competition among Part D plans, but Part D plans have higher average drug prices compared to Medicaid. The 2014 CBO study found that Medicare Part D premiums were lower in areas with robust competition among plans. However, Part D plans have higher average drug prices compared to Medicaid, which secures lower drug prices. Lawmakers have proposed giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices to leverage combined purchasing power. Some lawmakers propose modifying the noninterference provision to allow the Secretary to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, leveraging their combined purchasing power. In 2007, the House approved a bill that would have granted this authority but not the ability to create a formulary. The House approved H.R. 4 in 2007, allowing the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices but not create a formulary. A CBO analysis suggested minimal savings without additional regulatory authority. Patient and consumer groups have opposed giving this authority. The Senate did not approve a measure to allow the Secretary to create a central formulary for Part D drug prices. A CBO analysis indicated minimal savings without additional regulatory authority. Patient and consumer groups have opposed giving the Secretary more control over the formulary, fearing potential reductions in drug coverage. Lawmakers have introduced various bills to modify the noninterference provision, and the Obama Administration recommended granting the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for high-cost Medicare Part D drugs. Groups have opposed proposals to give the Secretary more control of the Part D formulary, fearing reductions in drug coverage. Lawmakers introduced bills to modify the noninterference provision, and the Obama Administration recommended granting the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for high-cost Medicare Part D drugs. The Trump Administration suggested requiring Part D plans to pass on more negotiated drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. The Trump Administration has recommended additional approaches for Medicare Part D, including requiring plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have also introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to CBO. The Trump Administration has recommended additional approaches for Medicare Part D, including requiring plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to CBO. State governments play an active role in regulating prescription drug use and pricing, as they are the main regulators of health insurance and administer and fund Medicaid. State governments play a key role in regulating prescription drug use and pricing, administering and funding Medicaid, and offering health insurance plans to state employees. Some states have patient assistance programs for low-income residents. Various approaches are being used by states to address prescription drug spending and access, focusing on limiting spending for high-priced drugs. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, fund Medicaid, and provide health insurance plans. Some states offer patient assistance programs for low-income residents. States are implementing strategies to control prescription drug costs and increase transparency in pricing. California, Delaware, and Vermont have passed laws to limit cost sharing and require manufacturer disclosure for drugs. In 2015, California set a $250 cap on cost sharing for a 30-day supply of drugs. Vermont passed a law in 2016 requiring manufacturer disclosure for drugs with large price increases. Manufacturers must justify price hikes to the state attorney general. Similar laws have been passed in other states to limit spending on high-priced drugs and increase transparency in drug prices. Vermont's 2016 law requires manufacturers to justify large price increases for drugs used by residents. Similar legislation in other states aims to increase transparency and limit spending on expensive drugs. Some states are also prohibiting gag clauses in pharmacy contracts to allow pharmacists to inform consumers about cheaper options. The Vermont law aims to force drug companies to justify prices based on costs. Some states are also passing legislation to prohibit gag clauses in pharmacy contracts, allowing pharmacists to inform consumers about cheaper options. Maine enacted a law in 2013 allowing citizens to import prescription drugs from certain countries, but it was ruled unconstitutional in 2015. The United States spends more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations. In 2013, Maine enacted a law allowing citizens to import prescription drugs from certain countries, but it was ruled unconstitutional in 2015. The United States spends more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations, with a projected increase in global drug spending share by 2021. The U.S. accounts for a significant share of global drug spending, projected to increase to 45% by 2021. U.S. per capita spending on retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, much higher than the OECD average of $553. The OECD found that U.S. per capita spending on retail prescription drugs in 2015 was $1,162, compared to the OECD average of $553. U.S. spending was higher than any of the other 30 industrialized nations examined, with significant price differences for specific drugs compared to other countries. In a recent study, researchers at the University of Liverpool compared the prices of cancer drugs in the United States and the European Union (EU), finding that U.S. prices were often double those in the EU. Reasons for higher U.S. drug prices include faster adoption of new drugs, patent protections, and market exclusivity for manufacturers. The higher U.S. spending and prices on drugs compared to the European Union are attributed to faster adoption of new drugs, patent protections, market exclusivity for manufacturers, and differences in healthcare systems such as government-run systems and external reference pricing. In the EU, health care systems set price limits for drugs using external reference pricing. National programs may use value-based pricing, while in Canada, the Common Drug Review assesses new and existing drugs for effectiveness. In Canada, the Common Drug Review evaluates the clinical and economic effectiveness of new and existing drugs for reimbursement by federal, territorial, and provincial drug plans. In the U.S., government and commercial payers are exploring alternative pricing models, such as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's agreement with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on specified goals for drug effectiveness. In the U.S., government and commercial payers are experimenting with alternative pricing models. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has a deal with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on specified goals for drug effectiveness. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to move towards value-based purchasing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing public reports on comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The CMS has encouraged state Medicaid programs to shift towards value-based purchasing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing public reports on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly approved drugs, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is conducting research on the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of newly approved drugs, which has caused concern in the pharmaceutical industry. The research aims to refine methodology for valuing prescription drugs and has led to discussions with various healthcare industry segments. The federal government focuses on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more funding towards clinical trials. ICER has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs by reaching out to different segments of the health care industry. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging due to the distinction between basic and applied research. Various studies have attempted to draw this line. When assigning credit for therapeutic advancements, distinguishing between basic and applied research can be difficult. Studies have tried to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery compared to private industry. A study in 2003 found that only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990-1999 originated from sources other than private industry. A study in 2003 found that of the 284 new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990-1999, only 6.7% originated from sources other than private industry. Another study in 1993 found that 7.6% of new drugs approved from 1981-1990 came from nonindustry sources. FDA focuses on new molecular entities (NMEs) for truly innovative drugs. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded work. Another study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 provides a comprehensive look at the contribution of nonindustry sources to innovative new drugs. A 2011 study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. The Stevens study revealed that 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007 originated from publicly funded research, with 19% of priority review applications stemming from this source. Public-sector research institutions had a higher rate of priority reviews compared to private-sector research. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research. This suggests that drugs discovered by PSRIs are more likely to receive priority review designation from the FDA. The authors found that drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions are more likely to receive priority review designation from the FDA, with an increase by a factor of 2.3. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with a disproportionately important clinical effect. The 2011 Stevens study found that drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions (PSRIs) tend to have a disproportionately important clinical effect. PSRIs are considered to have participated in the research leading to drug discovery if they created intellectual property specific to the drug that was later transferred to a company through a commercial license. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that contributed to the development of new drug classes approved by the FDA. The Stevens study found that drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions (PSRIs) have a significant clinical impact. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to the creation of new drug classes approved by the FDA. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods, as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates. The Cohen-Boyer, Riggs-Itakura, Cabilly, Axel, and Mello-Fire patents revolutionized drug development. Public funding played a crucial role in the approval of new drugs by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The development of new drugs using platform technologies significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook. A 2018 study revealed that public funding, particularly from the NIH, was associated with every NME approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. This funding supported both basic and applied research on new drugs. The analysis found that NIH funding was linked to every one of the 210 new drug approvals from 2010-2016, with 29% directly associated with NIH-funded projects. Up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, approximately $100 billion, contributed to research on new drug approvals. The study suggests that the NIH's role in new drug research is greater than previously thought. The study found that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, or about $100 billion, was associated with research contributing to new drug approvals from 2010-2016. This suggests that the NIH's contribution to new drug research is greater than previously thought. Publicly traded pharmaceutical manufacturers release aggregate corporate research and development spending information, but detailed data on specific drug development costs is limited. Academic researchers have estimated average drug development spending, with the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development study being the most cited. The study uses data from 10 large drug manufacturers to estimate average spending on clinical research for new drugs and development time costs. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development conducted a study based on data from 10 large drug manufacturers to estimate average spending on clinical research for new drugs. According to a 2014 estimate, the cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. The cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was estimated at $2.6 billion in 2014, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. There are challenges to the study's assumption of a 10.5% rate of return for drug companies. The 2014 estimate for developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was $2.6 billion, with $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Tufts studies have been challenged for assuming a 10.5% rate of return for drug companies and not capturing the positive impact of federal tax breaks on research and development spending. The 2016 HHS study noted that estimates for new drug development range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are highly sensitive to factors such as assumptions about development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs with special federal tax breaks. Transparency legislation being debated would compel drugmakers to provide necessary information. The 2016 HHS study highlighted the sensitivity of estimates for new drug development costs to factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs with special tax breaks. Price transparency legislation aims to compel drugmakers to disclose data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs or those with significant price increases. Price transparency legislation aims to compel drugmakers to provide data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs or those with significant price increases. However, studies show that research cost is not always a primary factor in drug pricing, as seen in the investigation of Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Several studies of specific drugs indicate that research cost was not a primary factor in pricing.
