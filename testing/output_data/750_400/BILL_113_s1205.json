    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy, more than 27% of total energy consumption in the United States, is released as waste heat from power plants. Additionally, 36% of total energy consumption is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and other buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and utilized for building heating or industrial processes. Waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings in the United States can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or electricity generation. Renewable energy resources can also be utilized to meet local energy needs. Renewable energy resources in communities in the United States can be used to meet local thermal and electric energy requirements, strengthening energy supplies in response to extreme weather events and power grid failures. Local waste heat and renewable energy resources also strengthen United States industrial processes. The resiliency of energy supplies in the United States can be enhanced by using local waste heat and renewable energy resources. This helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lowers emissions, increases energy supply security, and boosts local economies by creating jobs. District energy systems are crucial for tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, expanding combined heat and power systems, and enhancing energy supply resiliency and security while boosting local economies and creating jobs. District energy systems play a vital role in creating jobs, tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, expanding combined heat and power systems, serving various institutions and areas, and reducing power demand and constraints in transmission and distribution systems. District energy systems utilize thermal energy from CHP systems to serve various institutions and areas, reducing peak power demand and constraints in power transmission and distribution systems through thermal storage, generating power near load centers, and meeting air conditioning demand with chilled water produced by CHP systems or other energy sources. Evaluation and implementation of district energy systems is a complex undertaking involving technical, economic, legal, and institutional issues. Technical assistance is often required for successful implementation. The Act highlights the challenges in implementing district energy systems, which involve technical, economic, legal, and institutional issues. Technical assistance is often necessary to overcome these barriers. Lack of capital funding is a major constraint for utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, and decrease air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Lack of capital funding is a significant barrier to implementing these energy sources. The Act aims to encourage the use and distribution of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain more energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of a local energy infrastructure to achieve these goals. The Act aims to encourage the use and distribution of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain more energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of a local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while enhancing energy supply resiliency and industrial competitiveness. The Act promotes the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. A combined heat and power system generates electric energy and heat efficiently, while a district energy system provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants. The curr_chunk discusses the recovery of heat that is conventionally rejected to meet thermal energy requirements. It defines a district energy system as a system that provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants for various end uses. The Loan Guarantee Program and local energy infrastructure are also mentioned. The curr_chunk defines the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program as a system that recovers or produces useful energy from waste or renewable resources, generates electricity using combined heat and power, and distributes electricity in microgrids. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program defines infrastructure as a system that recovers or produces energy from waste or renewable resources, generates electricity using combined heat and power, distributes electricity in microgrids, stores thermal energy, and distributes thermal energy via a district energy system. The term \"microgrid\" refers to a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within defined electrical boundaries that can operate independently or connect to the main grid. The term \"microgrid\" refers to a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that can connect and disconnect from the grid to operate in grid-connected or island-mode. The term \"renewable energy resource\" includes biomass and gaseous or liquid fuels produced from renewable sources. The term \"renewable energy resource\" includes biomass, gaseous or liquid fuels, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, and solar energy. Renewable thermal energy includes heating or cooling energy from renewable sources, natural cooling sources like cold lake or ocean water. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" refers to heating or cooling energy from renewable sources, natural cooling sources like cold lake or ocean water, and other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"thermal energy\" specifically means heating energy in the form of hot water. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The term \"thermal energy\" refers to heating energy in the form of hot water or steam for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, and cooling energy in the form of chilled water or other media for air conditioning or process cooling. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy that is not efficiently utilized. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy contained in exhaust gases, steam, water, or heat that is not efficiently utilized in power generation systems. The term \"waste energy\" encompasses energy in exhaust gases, steam, water, or heat not efficiently used in power generation systems. It includes exhaust heat, hot liquids, flared gas from industrial processes, waste gas, and industrial tail gas that would otherwise be wasted. The term \"waste energy\" includes exhaust heat, hot liquids, flared gas, waste gas, pressure drop in gas systems, condenser water, and other forms of waste energy as determined by the Secretary. The term \"waste energy\" includes various forms of waste energy such as exhaust heat, hot liquids, flared gas, waste gas, pressure drop in gas systems, condenser water, and other forms as determined by the Secretary. This waste energy, if not being used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities, can be considered for alternative energy purposes.
