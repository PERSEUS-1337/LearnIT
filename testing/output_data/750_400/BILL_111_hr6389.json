    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men, with over 190,000 new diagnoses and 27,000 deaths in 2009. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer, and younger men are also at risk. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the disease. Prostate cancer affects older individuals, but younger men are also at risk, especially in early middle age. African-Americans have double the prostate cancer mortality rates compared to the White population. Underserved rural populations face higher mortality rates than urban areas, highlighting the need for improved access to care. African-Americans have double the prostate cancer mortality rates compared to the White population. Underserved rural populations also face higher mortality rates, emphasizing the need for improved access to care, especially through telehealth. Urologists play a key role in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients. Advances in telehealth can improve the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer by urologists. Despite progress in research, many questions remain about disparities in disease etiology, access to care, and community education. The causes of prostate cancer are still unknown. While progress has been made in understanding prostate cancer, many questions remain unanswered. The causes of the disease are still unknown, leading to challenges in accurately differentiating between aggressive and indolent forms early on. Overtreatment is common, and once prostate cancer has metastasized, there are no treatments that can durably arrest growth or cure the disease. There is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer due to challenges in accurately differentiating between aggressive and indolent forms early on. Roughly 23 to 54 percent of cases may be clinically indolent and overdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary treatments. Improved tests can reduce physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for patients and their families. Improved tests for prostate cancer can reduce overtreatment and save billions in healthcare costs. This is a high-cost area identified by the Medicare program. Prostate cancer research and health care programs in high-cost areas can save billions in healthcare costs by coordinating efforts across Federal agencies to improve accountability and implement best practices. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated across Federal agencies to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. SEC. 3. PROSTATE CANCER COORDINATION AND EDUCATION.
