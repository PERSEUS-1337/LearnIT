Preservation and restoration grants are available for historic buildings and structures at historically women's public colleges or universities. The Secretary awards grants to historically women's public colleges or universities for preserving and restoring historic buildings using funds from the National Historic Preservation Act for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Grants come with specific conditions. Grants awarded to women's public colleges or universities for preserving historic buildings come with conditions such as no alterations without Secretary's approval and providing public access to the property. Grants for preserving historic buildings require the grantee to agree to no alterations without Secretary's approval and to allow public access for interpretive and educational purposes.

For grants related to historic buildings or structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks, or designated historic districts, the grantee must provide 50% of the program costs from non-Federal sources, with the Secretary funding the remaining 50%. In-kind contributions such as property or personnel services from non-Federal interests can also be used for the program.
