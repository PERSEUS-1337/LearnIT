This includes actions like digging deeper wells, improving existing wells, addressing water contaminants, or connecting to a local water system. Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code establishes a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program to provide low-interest loans and grants for various purposes such as extending service lines, connecting to water systems, and closing abandoned septic tanks and wells for health and safety reasons. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program offers assistance for connecting to water systems, closing abandoned septic tanks and wells, deepening or improving groundwater wells, and installing water treatment systems if needed.

Homeowner's insurance must be maintained on the residence while the loan balance is outstanding.
