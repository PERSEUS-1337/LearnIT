    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. ATRA also temporarily extended provisions that had expired at the end of 2011 or 2012 through 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 permanently. However, ATRA did not eliminate uncertainty in the tax code as some provisions expired at the end of 2011 or 2012 and were temporarily extended through 2013. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions that expired at the end of 2013 for one year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 either made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended provisions that expired in 2013 through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that expired in 2014, known as \"tax extenders.\" In the 114th Congress, the debate on tax extenders focused on whether expired provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. The research tax credit, for example, was extended 16 times before being made permanent in P.L. 114-113. In the 114th Congress, the debate on tax extenders focused on whether expired provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. Most expired tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. In P.L. 114-113, expired tax provisions were extended, either temporarily or permanently, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. Some provisions remain set to expire at the end of 2016, prompting debate in the 114th Congress on whether they should be extended. The report provides an overview of tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016, prompting debate in the 114th Congress on whether they should be extended. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The curr_chunk provides information on various recently expired tax provisions, including business, individual, charitable, community assistance-related, and housing-related provisions. The reports mentioned cover these tax extenders and are authored by different individuals. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent expired tax provisions from 2014. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent expired tax provisions from 2014. The PATH Act also made permanent enhancements to child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit, with a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The PATH Act of 2015 made permanent the enhanced child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. It also included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, along with other tax-related provisions such as changes to high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax and extensions of tax credits for renewable power facilities. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, including a moratorium on the high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax and annual fee on health insurance providers. Legislation in the 113th Congress also proposed the EXPIRE Act for a two-year extension of tax credits for renewable power facilities and changes to the Section 199 deduction for oil refineries. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, retroactively through 2014. Other legislation in the 113th Congress proposed a two-year extension with the EXPIRE Act. Tax reform legislation introduced in the same Congress aimed to make certain provisions permanent, including the research and experimentation tax credit. In the 113th and 114th Congress, tax reform legislation aimed to make certain provisions permanent, including the research and experimentation tax credit and increased expensing allowances for businesses under IRC Section 179. Legislation such as the Jobs for America Act and America Gives More Act of 2014, as well as the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 and State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2015, sought to extend certain expired provisions permanently. In the 114th Congress, legislation aimed to extend certain expired provisions permanently, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances under IRC Section 179. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 would have extended temporary provisions for two years, making them available for the 2015 and 2016 tax year. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 for two years, making them available for the 2015 and 2016 tax year. This included dozens of temporary tax provisions and one provision that expired in 2013. S. 1946 aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 for the 2015 and 2016 tax year. The tax code contains numerous temporary provisions, often extended by Congress for short periods. The term \"tax extender\" refers to expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress, often for short periods. These temporary provisions allow Congress to evaluate their effectiveness before making them permanent. The term \"tax extender\" refers to expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress for evaluation before potential permanency. Temporary tax provisions serve various purposes such as evaluating effectiveness, providing relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. Temporary tax provisions are used by Congress to evaluate effectiveness before potential permanency, provide relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. The rationale for enacting temporary tax provisions is to assess their effectiveness before deciding on extension. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows for evaluation of effectiveness before potential extension. However, the practice of regularly extending expiring provisions without systematic review undermines this rationale. An expiration date can serve as a mechanism to prompt policymakers to consider the costs and benefits of special tax treatment. The rationale for enacting temporary tax provisions is undermined when expiring provisions are regularly extended without systematic review. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler highlighted in 2012 that expiration dates should prompt policymakers to evaluate the costs and benefits of special tax treatment, but in practice, there is no real systematic review. Instead, extenders are typically passed without careful analysis of their effectiveness. The special tax treatment policy lacks systematic review, leading to extensions without careful analysis of effectiveness. Some expiring tax provisions have not been extended, like tax incentives for alcohol fuels. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels, such as ethanol, were not extended beyond 2011, as they were found to be duplicative and ineffective in increasing consumption. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if an evaluation shows that the benefits do not outweigh the costs in foregone tax revenue. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that tax credits for ethanol under the renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandate were duplicative and did not increase consumption. Congress may not extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the cost in foregone tax revenue. Tax policy can address temporary circumstances like economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures such as bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Tax policy can be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures like bonus depreciation, casualty loss deductions, and net operating loss carrybacks. Recent examples include mortgage forgiveness exclusion, payroll tax cuts, and Section 1603 grants. Temporary provisions, such as mortgage forgiveness exclusion, payroll tax cuts, and Section 1603 grants, are enacted to address special economic circumstances. It is debated whether these provisions should expire once the situation is resolved or be extended for budgetary reasons. Congress may enact temporary tax policies to offset reduced revenues, making it easier to find resources for short-term extensions. Provisions like mortgage forgiveness exclusion, payroll tax cuts, and Section 1603 grants are temporary and may expire once the economic situation is resolved. Temporary tax policies can be enacted by Congress for budgetary reasons, making it easier to offset reduced revenues. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline, leading to potential overestimation of revenues if extensions are common. Temporary tax provisions have a smaller impact on the long-term fiscal outlook compared to permanent ones, acting as federal subsidies. Temporary expiring tax provisions, if routinely extended, can lead to the overestimation of projected revenues in the long-term fiscal outlook. These provisions, being temporary rather than permanent, have a smaller impact on the economy and act as federal subsidies that influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Like all tax benefits, extenders should be evaluated based on their impact on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. Temporary tax benefits, known as extenders, are federal subsidies that influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating these provisions involves considering their impact on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. Extenders can be efficient but not equitable, or equitable but not efficient, requiring policymakers to prioritize economic objectives. They often provide subsidies to encourage increased activity levels. Extenders provide subsidies to influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Policymakers must prioritize economic objectives such as efficiency, equity, and simplicity when evaluating these temporary tax provisions. Market distortions from taxes and other factors may improve economic efficiency in some cases. Tax extenders aim to influence economic behavior and resource allocation by providing subsidies. Economic theory suggests that markets function best when resources are allocated without distortions from taxes. However, market failures can occur, and tax distortions may actually improve economic efficiency in some cases. The effectiveness of extenders in improving economic welfare depends on whether they address a specific market failure. If an extender does not remedy a market failure, it can reduce economic efficiency. Additionally, an extender is considered effective if it stimulates the desired activity better than a direct subsidy. Tax extenders can improve economic welfare by addressing market failures and stimulating desired activities better than direct subsidies. However, direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting resources than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Fair taxation contributes to a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens based on individuals' engagement in tax-subsidized activities, deviating from the principles of horizontal equity. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens. Tax extenders can result in unequal tax burdens for individuals based on their participation in tax-subsidized activities, deviating from the principle of horizontal equity. Vertical equity in taxation calls for a fair distribution of tax burdens among individuals with different abilities to pay. This can lead to individuals with lower incomes having less opportunity to benefit from extenders compared to those with higher incomes. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens based on participation in tax-subsidized activities, deviating from horizontal equity. Vertical equity requires a fair distribution of tax burdens among individuals with different abilities to pay, but tax extenders often benefit those with higher incomes, reducing progressivity and equity in the tax system. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens based on participation in tax-subsidized activities, deviating from horizontal equity. The disproportionate benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system, which is often viewed as a reduction in equity. An example of the effect a tax benefit can have on vertical equity is illustrated by two teachers who have both incurred $250 in classroom-related expenses and are eligible to claim the above-the-line deduction for expenses. The tax benefit to the two differs if they are in different tax brackets. A teacher with lower income, in the 15% income tax bracket, receives a deduction with a value of $37.50, while another teacher, in the 33% bracket, receives a deduction value of $82.50. Tax extenders contribute to the complexity of the tax code and raise the cost of administering the tax system. The higher-income taxpayer receives a greater benefit from tax deductions than the lower-income taxpayer, leading to unequal tax burdens based on participation in tax-subsidized activities. The higher-income taxpayer benefits more from tax deductions, contributing to unequal tax burdens. Tax extenders increase complexity and costs in administering the tax system, impacting both the government and individual taxpayers. The complexity of temporary tax provisions increases costs for both the government and individual taxpayers. Dozens of provisions expired in 2014 but were extended in P.L. 114-113. These provisions fall into categories such as individual, business, charitable, or energy. Tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 were extended in P.L. 114-113, categorized into individual, business, charitable, or energy. The cost of the extension is included in Table 1. Individual tax extender provisions that expired in 2014 had previously been extended. The individual tax extender provisions that expired at the end of 2014 were extended in P.L. 114-113. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses incurred by school teachers is the longest-standing provision and was made permanent in the legislation. Other individual provisions have also been extended multiple times. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses for school teachers was made permanent in P.L. 114-113, along with other provisions like state and local sales tax deduction, tuition deduction, mortgage insurance premium deduction, and parity for employer-provided mass transit benefits. The deduction for state and local sales taxes, tuition and related expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Business provisions that expired in 2014, such as the research tax credit and Work Opportunity Tax Credit, had been extended multiple times. The exclusion of employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits was made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Business provisions that expired at the end of 2014 include the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) allocation limitation, active financing exception under Subpart F, and New Markets Tax Credit. Bonus depreciation and enhanced expensing allowances, seen as economic stimulus measures, also expired in 2014. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances expired at the end of 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, including the research tax credit and active financing exception under Subpart F. Several business-related extender provisions, such as the research tax credit and enhanced expensing under Section 179, were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Other provisions, like the New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation, were extended through 2019. Additionally, four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were also made permanent in the same legislation. The business tax extenders, including research tax credit and enhanced expensing, were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Other provisions, like New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation, were extended through 2019. Four charitable provisions expired in 2014 were also made permanent in the same legislation. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019 with a phase-down starting in 2017 as part of P.L. 114-113. Several temporary energy-related tax provisions expired in 2014 were first enacted in the Energy Policy Act. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019 with a phase-down starting in 2017 as part of P.L. 114-113. Several temporary energy-related tax provisions that expired in 2014 were first enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced tax incentives for energy efficient new homes, commercial buildings, and existing homes. These provisions were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. Alternative technology vehicles and fuel refueling property incentives were also included in EPACT05. The alternative motor vehicle credit for fuel cell vehicles expired in 2014. The EPACT05 introduced incentives for alternative technology vehicles and fuel refueling property, extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The credit for fuel cell vehicles expired in 2014, while credits for other alternative motor vehicles expired at earlier dates. The credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles, initially set to expire in 2014, was not extended in P.L. 113-295 but would be extended in the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015. This credit was first enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and was previously extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, along with other tax provisions. Congress has regularly extended expired or expiring tax provisions, and some provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, resulting in higher costs. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 extended credits for alternative motor vehicles and two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles through 2016. Congress has a history of extending expired tax provisions, with some made permanent in P.L. 114-113, leading to higher costs. The total estimated reduction in federal revenues from these extensions is $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $202.1 billion attributed to these extensions. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113, estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $202.1 billion attributed to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017 and the two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The estimated cost of extending tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $559.5 billion associated with permanent extensions. The estimated cost of extending tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $559.5 billion associated with permanent extensions. The total cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is $559.5 billion, with $361.4 billion for provisions that expired in 2014 and were made permanent. The cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is $361.4 billion, with $17.7 billion for provisions that expired in 2014 through 2016. Legislation considered in the 114th Congress aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions. The 114th Congress considered legislation to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions, with an estimated cost of $96.9 billion. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The cost of the proposal was estimated at $96.9 billion, with additional revenue raising provisions included. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the total cost, including macroeconomic effects, would be $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window. Extending certain expired provisions, such as the provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments, is expected to boost businesses. When macroeconomic effects are included, the cost of extending expired provisions in S. 1946 is $86.6 billion over 10 years. The JCT expects economic growth from extending business-related provisions, offsetting part of the federal debt increase. When macroeconomic effects are considered, the cost estimate for S. 1946 is lower due to expected economic growth. The increase in federal debt may be offset by higher interest rates, slowing economic growth. JCT's analysis shows increased economic growth within the budget window, leading to a reduced cost estimate. CBO provides estimated costs for extending tax provisions expiring before 2025. The net effect of JCT's macroeconomic analysis on S. 1946 shows increased economic growth, leading to a lower cost estimate. CBO estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. Extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would cost $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. Bonus depreciation would cost $223.6 billion, Section 179 expensing $60.8 billion, and extensions to tax credits $202.8 billion. Extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would cost $897.9 billion. Bonus depreciation would cost $223.6 billion, Section 179 expensing $60.8 billion, and extensions to tax credits $202.8 billion. Most of the revenue cost is for provisions that were either extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Most of the revenue cost associated with extending expiring tax provisions is for provisions that were either extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels likely to occur due to assumed expiration of tax extender provisions. This results in smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline compared to actual deficits likely to occur. The CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels likely to occur due to assumed expiration of tax extender provisions. This results in smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline compared to actual deficits likely to occur. Providing a short-term extension in \"tax extenders\" legislation costs less than extending expiring provisions through the budget window. The cost of providing a short-term extension in \"tax extenders\" legislation is less than extending expiring provisions through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions compared to JCT scores. If expiring provisions are temporarily extended, the 10-year revenue cost may be less than in 2015. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) scores the budget impact of temporary tax provisions, reflecting the cost of temporary extensions compared to current law. Expired provisions often involve tax deferrals or timing provisions like bonus depreciation. For example, a one-year extension of bonus depreciation in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2014 cost $1.2 billion over a 10-year budget window. The one-year extension of bonus depreciation in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2014 cost $1.2 billion over a 10-year budget window. Bonus depreciation was extended through 2019 in P.L. 114-113 at a cost of $11.3 billion over the 10-year budget window, with a 2016 estimated cost of $90.6 billion. The one-year revenue loss of bonus depreciation provision in 2015 was $45.3 billion, with costs recovered in later years. The extension through 2019 in P.L. 114-113 cost $11.3 billion over 10 years, with an estimated $90.6 billion cost in 2016. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over the 10-year budget window, as part of the tax extenders legislation passed in December 2015. This provision shifts cost recovery forward, resulting in revenue losses in earlier years, with part of that loss recovered in later years. The tax extenders legislation passed in December 2015 made certain temporary tax provisions permanent, costing $223.6 billion over 10 years. Legislation in previous Congresses also addressed expired tax provisions. During the 113th and 114th Congresses, legislation was considered to make certain expired tax provisions permanent or temporarily extend them. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years. The House had passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years, through 2016. The House had passed legislation to make permanent eight temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014. America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 would have made permanent enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 and included bills to extend expired S corporation provisions. The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 aimed to make permanent enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 and extend expired S corporation provisions. Additionally, the America Gives More Act of 2015 included three expired charitable provisions. The America Gives More Act of 2015 included three expired charitable provisions related to food inventory, tax-free IRA distributions for charity, and special rules for conservation contributions. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 aimed to make the research tax credit permanent. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 aimed to make the research tax credit permanent, along with other proposed legislation costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. During the 113th and 114th Congress, various bills were considered to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions, costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was passed to address these expired provisions. During the 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to make permanent expired provisions. A one-year \"tax extenders\" bill was passed in the 113th Congress. The Senate Finance Committee also considered a two-year extenders package. The Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014. The EXPIRE Act proposed extending expiring provisions for two years. The House passed legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent, reducing revenues by an estimated $511.4 billion. During the 113th Congress in 2015, the House passed legislation to make nine expiring tax provisions permanent, reducing revenues by an estimated $511.4 billion over 10 years. Six provisions were part of the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and three were included in the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). During the 113th Congress, the House passed legislation to make nine expiring tax provisions permanent, reducing revenues by an estimated $511.4 billion over 10 years. Six provisions were part of the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and three were included in the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). Additionally, two international-related extender provisions were not considered for extension in the full House. During the 113th Congress, legislation was reported to make two international-related extender provisions permanent, but it was not considered in the full House. Some provisions that expired in 2013 were not extended in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not included in the EXPIRE Act but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not included in the EXPIRE Act but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 without an expiration date and was modified and retroactively extended through December 31, 2019. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 without an expiration date and was extended through December 31, 2019. The credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles was not extended in the EXPIRE Act. The credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles was not extended past December 31, 2019, as part of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. Incentives for most alternative technology vehicles have expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016. Incentives for various alternative technology vehicles have expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016, but other energy-related provisions were not extended. The EXPIRE Act did not extend certain provisions that expired at the end of 2013, including tax-exempt bond financing for facilities in the New York Liberty Zone and the replacement period for nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by the 2008 Midwestern storms."
