    "content": "This report examines recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia and proposed congressional amendments. Key laws discussed include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. The Regulation Act of 1976, Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act are key laws discussed in relation to recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia. Congressional proposals, such as Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress, also aim to address the District's firearms laws in connection with voting rights issues. The District of Columbia's firearms laws are often tied to voting rights issues in Congress. Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress are similar proposals to amend the District's gun laws. This report compares the two bills and analyzes the current DC law post the FCAA and IPAA. The House Voting Rights Act of 2009 compares Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress regarding DC firearms laws post the FCAA and IPAA. Congressional proposals are analyzed in light of the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The report analyzes congressional proposals on DC firearms laws post the FCAA and IPAA in light of the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, affirming the individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. In Heller, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for lawful purposes like self-defense at home. The decision invalidated three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. The Supreme Court's ruling in Heller invalidated three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the ban on handgun registration, the prohibition on carrying a pistol without a license, and the requirement for firearms to be kept unloaded and disassembled or secured with a trigger lock. The Court did not address the District's license to carry requirement. The Supreme Court's ruling in Heller invalidated provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the ban on handgun registration and the requirement for firearms to be kept unloaded and disassembled or secured with a trigger lock. The Court did not address the District's license to carry requirement. After the ruling, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with Heller while considering permanent changes to the gun laws. After the Supreme Court's Heller ruling invalidated parts of the District's gun laws, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the decision. The Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 was the first of several attempts to amend the laws, but faced criticism for not fully aligning with Heller. The DC Council enacted the Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 in response to the Heller ruling, but faced criticism for not fully complying with it. In Congress, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced to potentially loosen the District's gun laws. H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress to amend DC's gun laws. It was later incorporated into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but not in the Senate. Senator John Ensign also introduced an amendment related to gun laws in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced an amendment related to gun laws in S. 160, which was approved by the Senate but later stalled. The House had previously passed H.R. 6842, which included similar language from H.R. 6691, but it did not become law. In 2009, the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were passed by the DC Council, incorporating language from emergency acts into permanent legislation. In September 2008, H.R. 6842 was enacted by the DC Council as emergency legislation until permanent legislation could take effect. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were later passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress, becoming effective on March 31, 2009, and May 20, 2009, respectively. These acts amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress, becoming effective on March 31, 2009, and May 20, 2009, respectively. These acts amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership, which were challenged and upheld in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on March 26, 2010. The District's new firearms amendments were challenged and upheld in court. Congressional legislation H.R. 645 aims to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code in light of these new acts. H.R. 645 aims to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, considering the recent FCAA and IPAA acts. It limits the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repeals the registration scheme. Sections 9-13 preserve some IPAA provisions, while Section 14 repeals others. The federal firearms laws set minimum standards for firearms regulations in the United States. States, territories, and the District of Columbia can add their own more restrictive laws that do not conflict with federal statutes like the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968. The District of Columbia has the authority to create its own firearms laws under the Home Rule Act, which supplements federal statutes like the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968. The District of Columbia has the authority to create its own firearms laws under the Home Rule Act, which allows for the regulation of firearms by the DC Council in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms in the District of Columbia, allowing for amendments to laws passed by Congress. Congress still retains the power to legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms in the District of Columbia, allowing for amendments to laws passed by Congress. Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority, including the right to enact legislation on any subject. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council authority to regulate firearms in the District of Columbia, allowing for amendments to laws passed by Congress. Congress reserves the right to legislate for the District on any subject, including amending or repealing laws enacted by the Council. The District of Columbia can amend or repeal congressional enactments depending on Congress's intent. Congressional acts may limit the District's authority to legislate, as seen in Section 3 of H.R. 645. The District of Columbia's authority to legislate can be limited by congressional acts, as shown in Section 3 of H.R. 645. This section explicitly restricts the District from prohibiting or unduly burdening the ability of individuals to possess firearms for legitimate purposes. The District of Columbia is prohibited from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms for legitimate purposes under H.R. 645. The District of Columbia is prohibited from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms for legitimate purposes under H.R. 645, which also includes provisions on transporting firearms for lawful purposes. The phrase \"transporting for legitimate purposes\" in H.R. 645 addresses transportation requirements from the IPAA. The Council would not have authority to make laws on firearms regulation. It is unclear what constitutes a restriction on acquiring firearms. The DC Council does not have authority to make laws on firearms regulation, and it is unclear what would constitute a restriction on acquiring firearms. The language in the legislation appears to prevent the District from barring firearms possession by individuals not prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law, and from prohibiting the possession of any firearm not already regulated under federal law. The legislation appears to prevent the District from creating stricter firearms laws beyond federal regulations, except for carrying. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging firearms possession. The District's firearms laws would align closely with federal laws, limiting the ability to create stricter provisions. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging firearms possession, and the scope of the District's authority to enforce sanctions for firearm misuse would be restricted. The proposed language would limit the District's authority to regulate firearms possession and enforcement of sanctions for firearm misuse. It would allow regulation of carrying firearms, but not explicitly at a person's dwelling place or place of business. The proposed language in Section 3 would restrict the District of Columbia's ability to regulate firearms possession and enforcement of sanctions for firearm misuse. It allows for regulation of carrying firearms, except at a person's dwelling place or place of business. The District could still argue for the ability to prohibit open or concealed carry altogether, despite the congressional provision. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the District of Columbia's ability to regulate firearms possession, allowing for regulation of carrying firearms with exceptions. The District could argue for the ability to prohibit open or concealed carry, despite the congressional provision. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the District of Columbia's ability to regulate firearms possession, allowing for regulation of carrying firearms with exceptions. An opposing argument could be made that the District does not have the authority to ban the open or concealed carriage of firearms. The DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" prior to Heller included any semiautomatic weapon that could shoot more than 12 shots without manual reloading. Prior to Heller, the DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, leading to restrictions on registering pistols. Under the old DC Code definition, any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading was considered a \"machine gun\" and prohibited from registration. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot with a single trigger function. The District amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing semiautomatic firearms to no longer be prohibited from registration. The District amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing semiautomatic firearms to no longer be prohibited from registration. However, H.R. 645 could potentially restore the pre-Heller definition of \"machine gun\" by undoing changes made by the FCAA. If H.R. 645 is enacted, it would restore the pre-Heller definition of \"machine gun\" in the District, aligning it with the federal definition. The bill would continue to prohibit certain firearms from being registered, following state laws like California. Section 4 of H.R. 645 would align the District's definition of \"machine gun\" with the federal definition, undoing previous restrictions on registering certain firearms. This change would allow for the registration of pistols for self-defense, which was previously prohibited. The District now allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns, as long as the applicant meets requirements. There is an exemption for temporarily possessing a registered firearm in another person's home. The FCAA allows registration of semiautomatic handguns for self-defense, with exemptions for temporary possession in another person's home. Amendments include qualification and information requirements for firearm registration. The FCAA allows registration of semiautomatic handguns for self-defense, with exemptions for temporary possession in another person's home. Amendments include qualification and information requirements for firearm registration, barring certain individuals with specific criminal histories from registering. Applicants with certain criminal histories or violent behavior within five years prior to applying are prohibited from registering a firearm under the FCAA. Additionally, completion of a firearms training or safety course is required for registration. The Firearm Concealed Carry Act (FCAA) prohibits individuals with certain criminal histories or violent behavior from registering a firearm. Applicants must also complete a firearms training course and provide an affidavit signed by a certified instructor. The Chief of Police is required to conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and limit registration to one pistol per person every 30 days. The Chief of Police must conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and limit registration to one pistol per person every 30 days, except for new residents who can register more than one pistol if owned lawfully in another jurisdiction for six months prior. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, allowing residents to purchase firearms without needing a registration certificate. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, allowing residents to purchase firearms without needing a registration certificate. Additionally, the bill would eliminate the need for licensing of gun owners and make other amendments to remove all registration language. The Chief would no longer be required to submit pistols for ballistics testing under this legislation. H.R. 645 would repeal firearm registration requirements in DC, allowing residents to purchase guns without a certificate. The bill eliminates licensing for gun owners and removes registration language. The Chief would no longer need to submit pistols for ballistics testing or limit handgun purchases to one per month. Amendments would be made to DC Code \u00a7 [phone number scrubbed].02 regarding sales and transfers of ammunition and firearms. H.R. 645 would amend DC Code \u00a7 [phone number scrubbed].02 to allow unlimited handgun purchases per month and transfer of ammunition to any person, excluding restricted pistol bullets. H.R. 645 would amend DC law to allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the requirement for licensed dealers to track ammunition inventory. H.R. 645 would amend DC law to allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the requirement for licensed dealers to track ammunition inventory. Additionally, both H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 permit interstate purchase of firearms, but do so in different ways. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose different methods for interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 would allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents, while H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to facilitate interstate firearms transfers. H.R. 645 proposes amending the DC Code to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to District of Columbia residents, bypassing federal law restrictions. The DC Code would allow federally licensed firearms dealers in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to District residents if legal conditions are met, bypassing federal restrictions. There is a requirement for licensed dealers to sell handguns with secure storage or safety devices, but no federal mandate on storage methods or trigger locks. The GCA requires licensed dealers to comply with legal conditions for handgun transfers in DC and other jurisdictions. Federal law does not mandate specific storage methods or trigger locks for firearms. The District's trigger lock requirement, deemed unconstitutional, was more stringent than federal law. The District's trigger lock requirement, declared unconstitutional, was stricter than federal law. Under the FCAA, any firearm in lawful possession must be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. The FCAA amended the trigger lock requirement in the District so that any firearm in lawful possession must be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock to prevent minors from accessing it without permission. The FCAA requires firearms to be stored securely to prevent minors from accessing them without permission, with penalties for negligent storage. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent minors from accessing them without permission, with penalties for negligent storage. Title II- S. 160 proposes repealing this section, while H.R. 645 introduces penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. Section 7 of H.R. 645 introduces penalties for negligent storage of firearms, specifically if a minor gains access to a loaded firearm and causes injury. This section aims to hold individuals accountable for knowingly leaving a loaded firearm accessible to minors, resulting in harm caused by the firearm's discharge. The bill introduces penalties for negligent storage of firearms if a minor accesses a loaded firearm and causes harm. Violators could face a fine up to $1,000 and/or one year in prison, with exceptions for securely locked containers. Any violation of negligent firearm storage laws could result in a fine of up to $1,000 and/or one year in prison, with exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks. The firearm storage laws have exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks, and also allow for certain situations like hunting or self-defense. The DC law on firearm storage has exceptions for lawful access, self-defense, hunting under supervision, and law enforcement possession. No prosecution is allowed if the victim is the child of the violator, unless gross negligence is involved. Currently, under DC law, a general violation of the registration scheme for firearms can result in a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to one year. A second offense for unregistered possession in certain areas may lead to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to five years. The unregistered possession of a firearm in certain areas can result in a fine of up to $1,000 or one year's imprisonment for a first offense, and up to $5,000 or five years' imprisonment for a second offense. H.R. 645 aims to remove this provision from the DC Code, while Title II- S. 160 would eliminate criminal penalties for selling or transferring firearms to individuals under 18. H.R. 645 aims to remove criminal penalties for unregistered possession of firearms in certain areas, while Title II- S. 160 would eliminate penalties for selling firearms to individuals under 18. The bill also amends definitions in the DC Code to ensure consistency between Titles 7 and 22. The District amended its firearms laws to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code, including terms like \"firearm,\" \"machine gun,\" and \"sawed off shotgun.\" Section 9 of H.R. 645 continues this harmonization by aligning definitions for certain terms. The IPAA allows DC to restrict possession of firearms on its property. Section 9 of H.R. 645 aligns definitions for terms like \"firearm,\" \"machine gun,\" and \"sawed off shotgun\" between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. It allows DC to prohibit possession of firearms on its property and permits property owners in the District to restrict firearms on their premises. Section 10 of H.R. 645 allows private persons or entities in the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their property, except for law enforcement personnel. This section also addresses property owners' ability to restrict firearms on their premises. Private persons or entities in the District of Columbia may prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their property, except for law enforcement personnel. This provision differs from existing DC law by further limiting private landlords' ability to restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their premises. The second part of Section 10 addresses the District's authority to restrict or prohibit firearms on public property. The proposed provision in Section 10 would restrict private landlords in DC from prohibiting tenants from possessing firearms on their premises. Additionally, the District would have the authority to restrict or prohibit firearms on public property, including buildings or areas with security measures in place. The District of Columbia would have the authority to restrict or prohibit firearms on public property, specifically within buildings or structures under its control with security measures in place. This restriction would not apply to lessees occupying residential or business premises. The proposed language would allow the District of Columbia to restrict firearms in buildings or structures under its control, with exceptions for lessees in residential or business premises. It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms on other real property under its control. The proposed language would grant the District of Columbia the authority to restrict firearms in buildings or structures under its control, with exceptions for lessees in residential or business premises. It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms on other real property under its control. The District of Columbia may have the authority to regulate firearms in buildings under its control, but it is unclear if this extends to all buildings or only those with security measures in place. The District of Columbia is uncertain about the extent of its authority to regulate firearms in buildings under its control, specifically whether it applies to all buildings or only those with security measures. The IPAA repealed the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, which would be reinstated by H.R. 645. The IPAA repealed the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, which would be reinstated by H.R. 645. H.R. 645 would also continue a provision prohibiting carrying a rifle or shotgun in DC, with exceptions discussed below. H.R. 645 reinstates the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry. It also continues a provision prohibiting carrying a rifle or shotgun in DC, with exceptions discussed below. States may impose their own laws on carrying firearms. The IPAA regulates the ability of law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms. The District currently allows registered firearm holders to carry within their home, for recreational purposes, at their place of business, or while transporting for lawful purposes. The Chief's authority to issue carry licenses appears to be revoked under the IPAA. H.R. 645 would modify the provision granting authority to carry firearms without a license, allowing individuals to carry loaded or unloaded firearms for lawful purposes in specific locations. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in specific locations for lawful purposes, including in their dwelling house, place of business, on land owned by them or by invitation on another's land, for recreational, sporting, education, training purposes, or while being transported for lawful purposes as authorized by District or federal laws. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in specific locations for lawful purposes, including in their dwelling house, place of business, on land owned by them or by invitation on another's land, for recreational, sporting, education, training purposes, or while being transported for lawful purposes as authorized by District or federal laws. The Chief's authority to issue licenses to carry concealed would be restored if H.R. 645 were enacted, allowing firearm owners to obtain a concealed carry license for carrying outside of these specific circumstances. H.R. 645 would restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing firearm owners to carry their weapons outside specific circumstances authorized by law. This includes lawful transportation of firearms for any lawful purpose. H.R. 645 would allow the lawful transportation of firearms for any lawful purpose, with specific regulations for transporting firearms in vehicles. The IPAA made a technical change to the District Code by including toy and antique pistols as types of firearms that are prohibited from being used to commit a violent or dangerous crime. H.R. 645 makes technical changes to the District Code regarding the transportation and use of firearms, including toy and antique pistols. It grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. H.R. 645 grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses, continuing a technical change regarding firearms use and transportation. The registration scheme would be repealed under H.R. 645, making it likely unnecessary to give the office jurisdiction over firearm registration certificates. The Office of Administrative Hearings was granted jurisdiction over firearm registration certificates under H.R. 645, but this may no longer be necessary as the registration scheme would be repealed. Additionally, amendments to the DC Code related to firearms laws would be repealed under the same bill. The congressional proposal in H.R. 645 would repeal the FCAA and IPAA, leading to the restoration of previous laws. This would impact the DC Code's provisions on dealer's licenses and firearm transfers, requiring individuals to meet new requirements. The DC Code's provisions for dealer's licenses and firearm transfers depend on obtaining a registration certificate. Repealing the registration scheme under H.R. 645 would allow individuals not prohibited from possessing firearms to qualify for a dealer's license and sell ammunition. The FCAA requires individuals to meet new requirements for firearm registration. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing eligible individuals to apply for a dealer's license and sell ammunition. Federal prohibitions on firearm possession are also discussed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, and users of controlled substances. Reporting duties for dealers regarding firearms and ammunition inventory would be repealed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, and users of controlled substances. Other prohibited categories include those adjudicated as mentally defective, unlawfully in the US, dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, renounced US citizenship, or on a nonimmigrant visa. It is unlawful for certain individuals to possess firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, users of controlled substances, mentally defective individuals, those unlawfully in the US, dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, renounced US citizenship, or on a nonimmigrant visa. Additionally, it is illegal for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer firearms to individuals in prohibited categories. Individuals prohibited from possessing firearms include those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged veterans, renounced citizens, and those on nonimmigrant visas. It is illegal for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell firearms to individuals in these prohibited categories. Under the FCAA, it is illegal for individuals to sell firearms to prohibited categories. Non-licensed persons can only sell firearms to licensed dealers in DC. Under the FCAA, individuals must meet federal and DC eligibility requirements to transfer firearms. Non-licensed persons can only sell firearms to licensed dealers in DC, even in private sales. H.R. 645 would maintain restrictions on licensed dealers transferring firearms to prohibited individuals. Under H.R. 645, private sales between non-licensed individuals in DC must go through a licensed dealer. The bill would eliminate registration requirements under DC law, making only federal disqualifications applicable for transfers. Additionally, the assault weapons ban under the FCAA would be impacted by this bill. The amendment under H.R. 645 would remove DC registration requirements for private sales, making only federal disqualifications relevant. It would also impact the assault weapons ban created by the FCAA, expanding the definition of \"assault weapon\" to include specific firearms and characteristics. The definition of \"assault weapon\" includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols with military-type characteristics, as well as semiautomatic firearms. The Chief can also designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat, except for certain exempt firearms. The new definition of \"assault weapon\" also applies in the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990. Manufacturers, importers, or dealers of designated assault weapons can be held strictly liable. The FCAA redefines \"assault weapon\" and imposes strict liability on manufacturers, importers, or dealers for any harm caused by the weapon's discharge in DC. These changes would be repealed by H.R. 645. The FCAA imposes strict liability for harm caused by assault weapons in DC, including large capacity ammunition feeding devices. H.R. 645 would repeal these changes. The FCAA in DC prohibits residents from possessing large capacity ammunition feeding devices, defined as devices that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This restriction remains in place despite the allowance for semiautomatic firearms possession. The FCAA in DC prohibits residents from possessing large capacity ammunition feeding devices, defined as devices that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This restriction remains in place despite the allowance for semiautomatic firearms possession. The term does not include certain types of devices, but under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers are generally prohibited from transferring firearms without a background check. Section 14 of H.R. 645 would repeal the provision regarding large capacity ammunition feeding devices for semiautomatic firearms. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers are prohibited from transferring firearms without a background check through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The licensee can transfer a firearm without a background check if no response is received from the NICS system after three business days and the transferee's identity is verified. Non-licensed persons are not required to conduct background checks under federal law. The DC Code imposes a 48-hour waiting period for sellers in the District. The DC Code imposes a 48-hour waiting period for sellers in the District before delivering a pistol or handgun. Under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days. The IPAA has extended the waiting period for firearm transfers in the District to 10 days, applying to all firearms, not just pistols. This change does not affect shotguns or rifles. The IPAA extends the waiting period for all firearms transfers in the District to 10 days, not just pistols. If repealed under H.R. 645, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA adds provisions for microstamping and requires firearms to have a unique identification or serial number. The FCAA adds provisions for microstamping on firearms, requiring semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, to be microstamp-ready. It also creates new sections 503 and 504 outlining these requirements. The FCAA introduces a new provision mandating that no licensee can sell semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, that are not microstamp-ready. Sections 503 and 504 outline the requirements for microstamp-ready pistols and prohibit the sale of pistols that do not meet these standards. The FCAA mandates that semiautomatic pistols must be microstamp-ready, with provisions for manufacturers to provide details to law enforcement. Section 504 prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned before that date. The FCAA mandates that semiautomatic pistols must be microstamp-ready, with provisions for manufacturers to provide details to law enforcement. Section 504 prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned before that date. Additionally, ownership or possession of such pistols is restricted, and transfers can only be done through licensed firearms dealers. The FCAA requires semiautomatic pistols to be microstamp-ready and prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009. Residents of DC can only sell or transfer ownership through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the roster annually for any changes. Discharging a firearm without a permit is unlawful. The FCAA requires the Chief to review the California Roster annually for any changes and allows for revisions to the roster of handguns deemed not unsafe. The IPAA prohibits firearm discharge without a special permit from the Chief, except for legitimate self-defense. It also permits the District to restrict firearm possession on its property and private property within the District, except for law enforcement personnel. The FCAA allows for annual review of the California Roster for handgun safety. The IPAA permits firearm discharge only with a special permit, except for self-defense. It also allows the District to restrict firearm possession on its property and private property, except for law enforcement personnel. H.R. 645 would repeal these provisions."
