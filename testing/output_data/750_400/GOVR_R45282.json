    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations and applications. These fees fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The EPA assesses fees on pesticide manufacturers and distributors for pesticide registrations and applications, which fund the agency's regulatory activities. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954, with additional appropriations covering most costs. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 was enacted to further support these activities. The U.S. Treasury pays for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities through fees authorized by Congress since 1954. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the current pesticide fee framework, modifying provisions from 1988 to enhance EPA's review of pesticide registrations issued before November 1, 1984. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established the current pesticide fee framework, including the collection of maintenance fees for EPA review of registrations issued before November 1, 1984, and registration service fees for new pesticide applications and label amendments. PRIA 1 established the pesticide fee framework, allowing the collection of registration service fees to cover EPA review costs for new pesticide registrations, label amendments, and tolerances. PRIA 2 in 2007 reauthorized and amended this framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act (PRIA) established a fee framework for EPA review activities, with specific timeframes for application reviews. PRIA 2 in 2007 added new application categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 further amended the pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act (PRIA) established a fee framework for EPA review activities, with specific timeframes for application reviews. PRIA 2 in 2007 added new application categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 reauthorized and further amended the pesticide fee framework, which was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The current pesticide fee framework, as amended by PRIA 3, is summarized in the following sections. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018. The pesticide fee framework was reauthorized and amended by PRIA 3 and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018. FIFRA Section 4 sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held, with a cap on the aggregate amount EPA may collect annually. FIFRA Section 4, amended by PRIA 3, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held. EPA can cancel pesticide registration if fees are not paid. Small businesses get fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from fees. Maintenance fees collected are deposited as receipts in the \"Reregistration and Expedited\" program. Section 4 of FIFRA allows EPA to cancel pesticide registration if maintenance fees are not paid. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and some public health pesticides are exempt from fees. Collected fees go to the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA to use in evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing, and reevaluating registered pesticides. The \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury provides receipts to EPA for offsetting costs related to evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing of applications, and reevaluating registered pesticides. Section 4 also allocates funds for enhancing information systems capabilities. EPA's authority to collect registration service fees will phase out starting at the end of FY2018. EPA is required to use funds to enhance information systems capabilities for tracking pesticide registration decisions. The authority to collect registration service fees will begin to phase out at the end of FY2018, with a 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended. If the authority to collect registration service fees is not extended, EPA's ability to collect fees would be reduced by 70% for FY2019 and expire at the end of the fiscal year. FIFRA Section 33, amended by PRIA 3, sets fees for 189 actions requested by applicants, with specific timeframes for completion. Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, establishes registration service fee amounts for 189 different actions requested by applicants. EPA must complete these actions within specified timeframes based on the category. The fee schedule includes reductions for small businesses and exemptions for applications related to \"minor uses\" of pesticides or tolerance setting in the public interest. The current fee schedule, subject to EPA adjustments, includes fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for \"minor uses\" of pesticides. Tolerance setting in the public interest and applications from governmental entities are also exempt from registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33. EPA is prohibited from assessing fees without advance annual appropriations. The authority to collect registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33 must be provided by annual discretionary appropriations. EPA is prohibited from assessing fees if appropriations for specified functions are below a certain threshold. EPA confirms minimum appropriations to determine fee assessment authorization. The EPA can assess registration service fees even if appropriations for specified functions are below a certain threshold. Collected fees are deposited into the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. The EPA can assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Collected fees are deposited into the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and can be used for review and decision-making purposes without fiscal year limitation. The \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury allows the EPA to use fee receipts for various purposes such as review and decision-making of applications, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and pesticide safety education programs. The EPA uses the Pesticide Registration Fund for reviewing applications, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and safety education programs. The Inspector General audits the fund annually as required by FIFRA and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The EPA receives $500,000 annually for its pesticide program activities from FY2013 to FY2018. FIFRA mandates the Inspector General to audit the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund and Pesticide Registration Fund yearly. The findings and recommendations of the audit must be submitted to EPA and certain congressional committees. Additionally, EPA is required to report on various aspects of its pesticide program activities annually. Congress allocated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018. The EPA receives annual funding for its pesticide program activities from FY2013 to FY2018. FIFRA mandates audits of the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund and Pesticide Registration Fund, with findings submitted to EPA and Congress. Congress allocated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018, but the exact amount for pesticide programs is not specified. EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. The EPA receives annual funding for pesticide program activities from FY2013 to FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Collected maintenance and registration service fees each year are estimated to provide one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA. Congress initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize the collection of maintenance and registration service fees for EPA's pesticide program activities in 2017. However, reauthorization legislation was not enacted, and the authority to collect fees was extended for one year through FY2018 appropriations. The House and Senate passed separate versions of the reauthorization.

The House and Senate passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation, with differences awaiting resolution. The House and Senate passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation for EPA's pesticide program fees. The House passed H.R. 1029, while the Senate passed an amendment renamed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018. Both versions would reauthorize fee collection through FY2023 and FY2025, with increased caps on maintenance fees. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1029, now called the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018. The amendment reauthorizes fee collection through FY2023 and FY2025, with increased caps on maintenance fees. EPA is directed to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking related to pesticide efficacy. The amendment to H.R. 1029, now the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018, increases maintenance fee caps and directs EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking on pesticide efficacy. Registration service fees for different actions are revised, and additional actions are included for fee collection. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would require EPA to carry out two final rules by October 1, 2021, with one exception, related to pesticide efficacy and registration service fees. EPA must also enhance good laboratory practices standards compliance monitoring. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, related to pesticide efficacy and registration service fees. One of the rules amends elements of the agricultural worker protection standard, allowing EPA to propose revisions to address certain issues. EPA must also enhance compliance monitoring for good laboratory practices standards. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021. One rule amends elements of the agricultural worker protection standard, while the other revises standards for certified pesticide applicators to protect applicators, the public, and the environment from risks associated with restricted use pesticides. EPA is authorized to propose revisions addressing application exclusion zones. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021. One rule addresses application exclusion zones, while the other revises standards for certified pesticide applicators to protect them, the public, and the environment from risks associated with restricted use pesticides. Additionally, the amendment directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on the use of designated representatives by October 1, 2021, examining their impact on pesticide application information availability and worker health and safety. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement final rules by October 1, 2021 on application exclusion zones and standards for certified pesticide applicators. It also mandates a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on designated representatives' impact on pesticide information availability and worker health and safety. The report must include recommendations to prevent pesticide misuse and hazards. H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, is being reconciled between the House and Senate.PRIA reauthorizations were previously enacted without roll call votes, indicating consensus. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, passed by the Senate on June 28, 2018, does not include a similar provision. On July 18, 2018, the House requested a conference with the Senate to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were enacted without roll call votes, showing consensus among members. Members have acknowledged a coalition of organizations representing the pesticide industry, state agricultural departments, and environmental and farmworker interests for developing and reauthorizing PRIA. The Senate and House are in disagreement over the EPA's administration and enforcement of FIFRA regulations in the current PRIA reauthorization. There is a general consensus for extending the pesticide fee framework, with recognition given to a coalition of organizations involved in developing PRIA."
