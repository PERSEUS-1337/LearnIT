Enforcement adequacy and jurisdictional differences pose challenges. The maritime industry faces challenges in enforcing regulations to protect marine resources and human health, with overlaps, gaps, and jurisdictional differences. Public attention is focused on the cruise industry due to its visibility and environmental impact concerns. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping fleet, is under scrutiny for its environmental impacts. Despite its significant economic contributions to the U.S., concerns over its activities persist. The cruise industry, accounting for 13% of the world shipping fleet, contributes $40 billion to the U.S. economy and supports over 357,000 jobs. The number of cruise passengers has been growing at an average rate of 7.4% since 1990, with 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The fleet consists of over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. Since 1990, the global cruise industry has seen an average annual growth rate of 7.4%, with 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The fleet comprises over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular choices. Six companies own nearly 95% of passenger ships in U.S. waters, with new, larger, and more luxurious vessels being added each year. Ship sizes have been increasing by approximately 90 feet every five years over the past two decades. The cruise industry, dominated by six companies, continues to grow with larger and more luxurious ships being added each year. Ship sizes have been increasing by about 90 feet every five years, with the average ship now exceeding 1,050 feet in length and weighing over 130,000 tons. Safety and health concerns for passengers and visited communities are key issues for the industry. The cruise ship industry is growing with larger and more luxurious ships being added each year, increasing in size by about 90 feet every five years. The average ship entering the market from 2008 to 2011 will be over 1,050 feet long and weigh more than 130,000 tons. Safety and health concerns are key issues for the industry, with cruise ships compared to \"floating cities\" due to the volume of wastes produced. During a one-week voyage, a large cruise ship with 3,000 passengers and crew can generate 210,000 gallons of sewage and 1 million gallons of graywater. Cruise ships, like \"floating cities,\" produce large amounts of waste during voyages. A ship with 3,000 passengers can generate 210,000 gallons of sewage, 1 million gallons of graywater, 130 gallons of hazardous waste, 8 tons of solid waste, and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Improper disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health and the environment. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about existing laws. Cruise ships produce large amounts of waste, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Improper disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes, with weak enforcement noted. Foreign-flag cruise ships have been involved in numerous illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, as highlighted in a 2000 General Accounting Office report. The 2000 General Accounting Office (GAO) report highlighted concerns about cruise ships' compliance with environmental requirements, revealing 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. 83% of these cases involved oil or oil-based products being discharged, ranging from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. The GAO reviewed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, finding that 83% involved oil or oil-based products. 72% were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of the cases by foreign-flag ships. The GAO found that 87 cruise ship cases accounted for 4% of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships in U.S. waters. While most cases were accidental, some led to criminal prosecutions and fines. In 2000, a coalition of environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address pollution by cruise ships, leading to investigations and studies on wastewater, oil, and solid waste discharges. In response to a petition by environmental groups, the EPA studied cruise ship discharges and waste management. In 2008, the agency released a report summarizing information on cruise ship waste. In 2000, the EPA issued a background document with recommendations for further assessment of cruise ship pollution. In December 2008, the agency released a report summarizing cruise ship waste streams and findings from data collection activities, especially in Alaskan waters. The report also identified options to address ship discharges. The report provides information on cruise ship waste streams and recent data collection activities, focusing on ships operating in Alaskan waters. It discusses options to address ship discharges and highlights the various types of waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships. The report also addresses the complex body of international and domestic laws regulating pollution from cruise ships. The report discusses the various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships, as well as the international and domestic laws regulating pollution from these ships. It also mentions federal and state legislative activities in Alaskan waters and other states, highlighting steps taken by cruise ship companies to prevent illegal waste discharges and improve environmental operations. The report discusses federal and state legislative activities concerning cruise ships in Alaskan waters and other states. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to prevent illegal waste discharges. Environmental groups support legislation for stricter standards on wastewater and other discharges from cruise ships. Environmental groups have supported legislation for stricter standards on wastewater and other discharges from cruise ships, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste. Legislation in the 109th and 110th Congresses endorsed the Clean Cruise Ship Act, but similar legislation in the 111th Congress did not progress. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can harm the marine environment if not properly treated and disposed of. These waste streams include sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, as well as air pollutants. Despite the potential threats to human health and aquatic life, it is important to keep these discharges in perspective as cruise ships represent a small portion of overall pollution. Cruise ships generate various waste streams including sewage, graywater, and solid waste, which can harm the marine environment. These wastes emit air pollutants and if not properly treated, can pose a threat to human health and aquatic life. Despite being a small portion of the shipping industry, cruise ships are a significant source of pollutants. Cruise ships, although a small part of the shipping industry, produce significant amounts of sewage, graywater, and solid waste. Their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas can have a significant cumulative impact on the environment. Cruise ships carry large numbers of passengers and crew, producing significant volumes of waste, including blackwater which contains harmful bacteria and viruses. Their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas can have a significant impact on the environment. The impact of blackwater, which is sewage containing harmful bacteria and viruses, can be significant on a local scale. Discharges of untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage promote excessive algal growth, leading to oxygen depletion in the water and potential harm to aquatic life. Cruise ships generate a large amount of sewage daily, further contributing to environmental concerns. Treated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing health risks. Nutrients in sewage promote algal growth, depleting oxygen in water and harming aquatic life. Cruise ships produce significant amounts of sewage daily, contributing to environmental concerns. Graywater from ships contains various pollutants like bacteria, detergents, and oils. A large cruise ship can generate 15,000 to 30,000 gallons per day of sewage, containing pollutants like fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, and oils. Graywater from ships can also contain various pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria at higher levels than untreated domestic wastewater. EPA and Alaska state sampling found untreated graywater from cruise ships can have variable pollutant strengths. Graywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants such as detergents, oil, grease, metals, organics, petroleum hydrocarbons, nutrients, food waste, and medical and dental waste. EPA and Alaska state sampling found that untreated graywater can have variable pollutant strengths, with fecal coliform bacteria levels one to three times higher than in untreated domestic wastewater. Cruise ships generate an average of 67 gallons/day/person of graywater, which is higher than residential graywater generation. Cruise ships generate a significant amount of graywater, which can contain pollutants like nutrients and oxygen-demanding materials. Graywater is the largest liquid waste source on cruise ships, while solid waste includes glass, paper, cardboard, and plastics, which can be hazardous. Solid waste generated on cruise ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can be hazardous. Solid waste that enters the ocean can become marine debris, posing a threat to marine life, humans, coastal communities, and industries. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board. Solid waste from cruise ships, including glass, paper, plastics, and metals, can be hazardous if it enters the ocean, becoming marine debris. Cruise ships manage waste through source reduction, recycling, and incineration, with up to 75% being burned on board. This can lead to marine life being harmed by entanglement with waste, posing a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries. Solid waste from cruise ships, including glass, paper, plastics, and metals, is managed through source reduction, recycling, and incineration. 75% of solid waste is incinerated on board, with some ash discharged at sea. Marine life can be harmed by entanglement with waste, with each cruise ship passenger generating two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day. Large cruise ships can generate up to 8 tons of solid waste during a one-week cruise. Large cruise ships can generate about 8 tons of solid waste during a one-week cruise, with 24% of global vessel waste coming from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board, but when off-loaded, it can strain port reception facilities. Cruise ships generate 24% of global vessel waste, mostly treated on board. Hazardous wastes come from various on-board activities like photo processing and equipment cleaning. Types of waste include chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from various on-board activities, including photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes contain substances such as hydrocarbons, heavy metals, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Hazardous waste generated on cruise ships includes substances like hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals, paint waste, solvents, fluorescent and mercury vapor light bulbs, batteries, and pharmaceuticals. The toxicity of these wastes to marine organisms can be significant if not managed carefully. Oil leaks from engine and machinery spaces on ships can mix with water in the bilge. The waste generated on cruise ships, although relatively small, can be toxic to marine organisms if not managed carefully. Oil leaks from engine and machinery spaces mix with water in the bilge, posing threats to fish, wildlife, and human health. Bilge water may also contain solid wastes and pollutants. Oil, gasoline, and byproducts from petroleum breakdown in bilge water can harm marine life and human health. Even small amounts of oil can be lethal to fish. Bilge water also contains solid wastes, pollutants, and toxic chemicals from engine cleaning. Large vessels have additional waste streams with varying levels of contaminants. Large vessels, such as cruise ships, generate oily bilge water containing pollutants like oil, chemicals, soaps, and detergents. These toxic chemicals can harm marine organisms if discharged, with large ships producing an average of eight metric tons of oily bilge water every 24 hours. To maintain ship stability and prevent hazardous conditions, bilge spaces need to be flushed regularly. Large cruise ships generate oily bilge water that needs to be extracted before discharge. A separator is typically used for this process, but if faulty, it can lead to oil getting into the bilge. Large cruise ships generate oily bilge water that needs to be extracted before discharge to prevent oil pollution. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could harm marine life when discharged into the ocean. EPA states that bilge water is a common source of oil pollution from cruise ships, leading to environmental violations for some cruise lines. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could harm marine life when discharged into the ocean. Cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers use ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport, leading to environmental violations for some cruise lines. In recent years, cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers use ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport. Ballast water is essential for compensating changes in weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded, and as fuel and supplies are consumed. However, ballast water discharge contains various biological materials. Ballast water discharge from ships contains a variety of biological materials, including non-native species that can harm aquatic ecosystems. This poses risks to public health, the environment, and incurs significant economic costs. Ballast water discharges introduce invasive species to U.S. marine waters, causing ecological, economic, and public health risks. The economic cost of pest mollusk introduction alone is estimated at $2.2 billion annually. These issues affect various industries and are not limited to cruise ships. The economic cost of introducing pest mollusks to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is about $2.2 billion per year, impacting industries such as water and power utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Further study is needed to determine the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. Air pollution from cruise ships is generated by diesel engines burning high sulfur content fuel. Air pollution from cruise ships is caused by diesel engines burning high sulfur content fuel, emitting sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons. Diesel exhaust is classified as a likely human carcinogen by the EPA. Emissions from marine diesel engines contribute to unhealthy air quality, visibility degradation, haze, acid deposition, and eutrophication. Further research is needed to understand the impact of cruise ships on introducing non-native species. EPA classifies diesel exhaust from marine engines as a likely human carcinogen. Ocean-going vessels contribute significantly to air pollution, including nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. Ocean-going vessels are a major contributor to air pollution, emitting nitrogen oxide, particulate, sulfur dioxide, and greenhouse gases. EPA estimates that these vessels account for a significant portion of mobile source emissions in the United States. The International Maritime Organization states that international shipping contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. Ships are a significant source of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides. The International Maritime Organization estimates that international shipping contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. States and localities are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of commercial marine vessels on regional air quality, especially when ships are docked in port. Maritime vessels, including cruise ships, emit significant amounts of black carbon and nitrogen oxides, contributing to climate change. States and localities are assessing the impact of commercial marine vessels on regional air quality, especially when docked in port. Cruise ship emissions can have significant local impacts in specific coastal areas. Cruise ship emissions, including black carbon and nitrogen oxides, can impact areas far inland and regions without large ports. Despite being a small fraction of the shipping fleet, cruise ship emissions can have significant local impacts in coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn garbage and waste, potentially releasing toxic emissions. International protocols and domestic laws regulate waste disposal on cruise ships. Cruise ships generate various waste streams, including garbage and plastics, which are incinerated on board. The disposal of ash from incinerators and potential toxic emissions are regulated by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws. The International Maritime Organization oversees maritime vessel safety and pollution control. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and pollution standards, including the MARPOL 73/78 Convention. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to these regulations. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) enforces maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards through the MARPOL 73/78 Convention. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with these regulations, regardless of their sailing location. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities, and the Convention's six Annexes address various sources of ship pollution to protect the marine environment. The MARPOL Convention requires signatories to comply with its regulations regardless of sailing location. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities. The six Annexes of the Convention address different sources of ship pollution, but alone are not enough to protect the marine environment without ratification and implementation by sovereign states. The MARPOL Convention's Annexes address various sources of ship pollution, including regulations for oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage disposal, and emission limits. Ratification and implementation by sovereign states are necessary to protect the marine environment. The MARPOL Convention's Annexes cover standards on packing, marking, labeling, and notifications to prevent pollution by harmful substances. Annex IV addresses sea pollution from sewage, Annex V regulates garbage disposal, and Annex VI sets emission limits for marine vessels. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary until ratified by a majority of member countries representing 50% of gross tonnage. Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention sets limits on emissions from marine vessels and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary until ratified by a majority of member countries representing 50% of the world's gross tonnage. Ratification of Annexes requires a lengthy process, and amendments can be proposed by parties that have ratified them. All six Annexes have been ratified, with the most recent being Annex VI. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of the MARPOL Convention, but has not taken action regarding Annex IV. The flag state of a ship is responsible for certifying compliance with MARPOL's pollution prevention standards. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of the MARPOL Convention, with the flag state responsible for certifying compliance with pollution prevention standards. IMO has established various conventions on issues like ballast water management and safety codes. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and pledge to comply with related laws of other nations. In the United States, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL provisions, with the most recent action in April 2006 ratifying Annex VI. Each signatory nation enacts domestic laws to comply with the convention and related laws of other nations. In the United States, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL provisions, with the most recent action in April 2006 ratifying Annex VI. Congress approved legislation in July 2008 to implement the standards in Annex VI through regulations to be promulgated by EPA in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard (P.L. 110-280). The Senate ratified Annex VI to regulate air pollution, and Congress passed legislation in July 2008 to implement the standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard (P.L. 110-280). The United States also participated in international negotiations to strengthen MARPOL Annex VI, resulting in amendments in October 2008. APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. navigable waters or ports. The United States ratified Annex VI to regulate air pollution and passed legislation in July 2008 to implement the standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. navigable waters or ports, with the Coast Guard responsible for enforcing regulations. The regulatory mechanism established in APPS to implement MARPOL is separate from other federal environmental laws. The Coast Guard enforces regulations under APPS for vessels in U.S. waters. Implementing MARPOL for maritime shipping faces challenges due to international nature. Countries can verify compliance and detain noncompliant ships. The U.S. can take enforcement action under its laws. The difficulties in implementing MARPOL for maritime shipping stem from its international nature. Countries can verify compliance and detain noncompliant ships. The United States can enforce its laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination is required for procedures involving flag states. The United States can take enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction, but coordination with flag states is necessary. Despite referrals to flag states, the response rate has been poor. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, but no single agency coordinates all relevant government actions. The United States requires coordination with flag states for enforcement actions against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, with the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and Department of Justice playing key roles. The Department of State represents the U.S. at international meetings and treaty negotiations. The U.S. government agencies responsible for enforcing regulations on pollution incidents involving foreign-flagged ships include the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, Department of Justice, Department of State, NOAA, and APHIS. The U.S. government agencies responsible for enforcing regulations on pollution incidents involving foreign-flagged ships include the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, Department of Justice, Department of State, NOAA, and APHIS. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) works with the Coast Guard and EPA to report on the effects of marine debris. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) ensures quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage. States and localities may also have responsibilities. U.S. laws and regulations that apply to cruise ship discharges include the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act (CWA), is the main U.S. law for limiting pollution in water bodies. It includes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program to control pollutant discharges from cruise ships and other sources. States and localities may also have responsibilities in enforcing these regulations. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary U.S. law for limiting pollution in water bodies through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. Point sources, including vessels, require a permit to discharge pollutants. However, sewage discharges from cruise ships and vessels are exempt from this requirement. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated or inadequately treated sewage discharge from vessels, including cruise ships, into U.S. navigable waters within 3 miles of shore. Implementation is a joint effort by the EPA and Coast Guard. Commercial vessels must comply with this regulation. Under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, vessels, including cruise ships, are prohibited from discharging untreated sewage within 3 miles of U.S. navigable waters. The EPA and Coast Guard jointly enforce this regulation, requiring marine sanitation devices on vessels with installed toilets to prevent untreated sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard oversees MSD design, operation regulations, and compliance certification. The Coast Guard enforces regulations for marine sanitation devices (MSDs) on vessels with installed toilets to prevent untreated sewage discharge. MSDs are designed to hold or treat sewage before discharge, with Type II and Type III MSDs used on large vessels like cruise ships. Raw sewage can be discharged beyond 3 miles from U.S. navigable waters. MSDs on vessels are used to hold or treat sewage before discharge. Large vessels like cruise ships use Type II or Type III MSDs. Type II treats waste before discharge, meeting specific limits, while Type III stores waste for later treatment onshore or discharge outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage before discharge, with a fecal coliform bacteria limit of 1,000 per 100 milliliters. Type I MSDs are mainly on smaller vessels, while Type II treats waste to meet limits, and Type III stores waste for later treatment or discharge outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage before discharge, meeting a fecal coliform bacteria limit of 1,000 per 100 milliliters. These systems are typically found on smaller vessels. Regulations do not require monitoring or reporting of effluent discharges, leading to criticism from critics, especially regarding large vessels like cruise ships. The regulations for effluent discharges from ships, last revised in 1976, lack requirements for sampling, monitoring, and reporting. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulatory structure, especially for cruise ships and large vessels. Unlike the NPDES permit program, which regulates various pollutants, the MSD regulations only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. NPDES permit holders must comply with sampling, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, which are absent in the MSD rules. The Coast Guard, responsible for inspecting cruise ships for compliance with MSD rules, has been criticized for poor enforcement. GAO report in 2000 noted inspectors rarely have time to inspect sewage treatment equipment. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of MSD rules, with inspectors rarely having time to check sewage treatment equipment on cruise ships. Factors like focus on safety, limited time, and staff hinder inspectors' ability to detect violations of environmental laws. The GAO reported limitations in Coast Guard inspectors' ability to detect violations of environmental laws, including focus on safety, large size of cruise ships, limited time and staff for inspections, and lack of surprise element in inspections. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard has shifted focus to homeland security activities, reducing resources for vessel inspections for environmental compliance. The Coast Guard carries out various responsibilities including homeland security and non-homeland security tasks. Since September 11, the Coast Guard has prioritized homeland security over vessel inspections for environmental compliance, potentially reducing resources for marine environmental protection. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment plants or holding tanks on cruise ships. MARPOL's Annex IV regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks. While it is not mandatory in U.S. waters due to non-ratification, its requirements are minimal compared to U.S. rules for MSDs. MARPOL's Annex IV regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. In U.S. waters, compliance is not mandatory due to non-ratification, with minimal requirements compared to U.S. rules for MSDs. Vessels must have certified sewage treatment systems or holding tanks, with specific discharge regulations based on distance from shore. MARPOL's Annex IV regulates sewage discharges from vessels based on distance from shore. Within three miles, sewage must be treated by a certified MSD. Between three and 12 miles, treatment by maceration or chlorination is required. Beyond 12 miles, sewage discharges are unrestricted, with alternative requirements allowed in certain jurisdictions. In U.S. waters, compliance with Clean Water Act regulations is mandatory for cruise ships and vessels. In U.S. waters, cruise ships and vessels must comply with Clean Water Act regulations, including using Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage treatment, which are more effective than traditional Type II MSDs in removing pollutants. In Alaskan waters, sewage is treated using Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems, which are effective in removing various pollutants. Section 312 also establishes no-discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage. The Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems in Alaskan waters effectively remove solids, oil and grease, and particulate metals from sewage. However, they are only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients. Section 312 establishes no-discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage, allowing states to prohibit the discharge of treated and untreated sewage from vessels with installed toilets into certain waters. States can apply to the EPA for NDZ designation based on the need for greater environmental protection. To create a no-discharge zone for sewage discharges by vessels, states can apply to the EPA based on the need for environmental protection. This designation has been used for waters in 26 states, including inland areas. The EPA allows states to establish no-discharge zones for sewage from vessels to protect the environment. These zones have been designated in 26 states, including inland areas, and in special waters of environmental importance. No-discharge zones (NDZ) are established by states to protect environmentally sensitive areas and drinking water intake zones from sewage discharge. NDZ designations have been used in special waters like the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Hudson River in New York. EPA identified options to address sewage from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. The EPA identified options in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising standards for discharge, restricting discharge out to 3 miles from shore, and requiring sampling and testing of wastewater treatment equipment. Possible options to address sewage from cruise ships include revising discharge standards, restricting discharge out to 3 miles from shore, requiring sampling and testing of wastewater treatment equipment, and imposing uniform requirements on all ships. Graywater is not defined as a pollutant under current federal law, and there are no separate effluent standards for graywater discharges. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant and there are no separate effluent standards for graywater discharges. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes, with limits on bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids. Alaska state law requires treatment of graywater before discharge. The Water Act defines graywater as sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes, with limits on bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids. Alaska state law also mandates treatment of graywater before discharge. EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with restrictions on graywater discharges. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas where graywater discharges from cruise ships may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. NOAA regulations restrict such discharges in areas like the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with restrictions on graywater discharges similar to those in Alaskan waters. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries to restrict graywater discharges from vessels to protect sensitive ecosystems, such as coral. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. The EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, including establishing standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are regulated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act regulates cruise ship discharges of solid waste, with Title I making it illegal to dump garbage into ocean waters without a permit. EPA issues permits for disposal at sea, excluding dredged material disposal. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act regulates cruise ship discharges of solid waste, with EPA issuing permits for disposal at sea. No permit is required for routine discharge of effluent incidental to vessel propulsion. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates cruise ship discharges of solid waste. No MPRSA permit is needed for solid waste disposal at sea, except for dredged material. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also applies, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) prohibits garbage discharge within specific distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere. It applies to all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), enforced by the Coast Guard through inspection programs. EPA reports solid waste discharges have occurred. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) prohibits garbage discharge within specific distances from shore and plastic discharge in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Coast Guard enforces this regulation through inspection programs. EPA has reported solid waste and plastic discharges from cruise ships, prompting evaluations by the IMO to potentially amend Annex V of MARPOL. EPA has suggested options like improving on-board garbage handling and treatment technologies. The EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships. The IMO is considering amending Annex V of MARPOL. Possible solutions include improving on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, prohibiting incinerator ash discharge into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and preventing solid waste discharge into the marine environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management from generation to disposal, imposing requirements on generators. Possible solutions for cruise ship waste include compactors, incinerators, stronger waste management plans, prohibiting incinerator ash discharge, expanding port reception facilities, and monitoring to prevent solid waste discharge into the marine environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law governing hazardous waste management, imposing management requirements on generators, transporters, and disposal facilities. Hazardous waste is defined as ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, or listed industrial process waste streams and commercial products. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must comply with RCRA regulations. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) imposes management requirements on generators, transporters, and facilities handling hazardous waste. Waste is considered hazardous if it is ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, or listed on specific industrial waste streams and commercial products. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must have permits and comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ship operators may be subject to RCRA rules as generators or transporters of hazardous waste. Issues for the cruise ship industry include proper identification of hazardous waste. The cruise ship industry must comply with RCRA regulations for hazardous waste management, including proper identification and handling of waste generated onboard. Waste is stored onboard until it can be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA requirements. Hazardous wastes generated onboard cruise ships are stored onboard until offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA regulations. Various activities on cruise ships produce hazardous wastes subject to RCRA, such as the use of chemicals in cleaning, painting, beauty parlors, and photo labs. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes from activities like cleaning, painting, beauty parlors, and photo labs, which are subject to RCRA regulations. However, it is unclear which regulations apply to managing and disposing of these wastes. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes from various operations, but it is unclear which regulations apply to their management and disposal. RCRA rules for small-quantity generators are less stringent than those for large-quantity generators, and it is uncertain how cruise ships are classified in terms of waste generation. Some companies argue they generate less than 100 kilograms per month, potentially impacting their classification. Some cruise companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month, potentially impacting their classification under less stringent regulations for notification and recordkeeping. The classification of cruise ships as large or small generators of hazardous waste is unclear, leading to uncertainty in how regulations apply to their waste management. The release of hazardous substances by cruise ships may trigger the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), but this has not been commonly used in response to cruise ship releases. CERCLA mandates immediate notification to the National Response Center for any hazardous substance release above regulatory thresholds. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires immediate notification to the National Response Center for any hazardous substance release above regulatory thresholds, but it has not been commonly used for cruise ship releases. EPA has identified 500 wastes that may present substantial danger to public health or the environment. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires notification for hazardous substance releases into waters of the United States or the contiguous zone. EPA has identified 500 hazardous wastes and set rules for reportable quantities, including releases as small as 1 pound of some substances. CERCLA authorizes the President to take remedial action for releases, in addition to RCRA regulations for hazardous waste. EPA has identified 500 hazardous wastes as reportable under CERCLA and set rules for quantities, including releases as small as 1 pound. The President, through the Coast Guard, can take remedial action for releases. Hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are also regulated under the Clean Water Act. EPA identified possible discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In addition to RCRA, hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances into U.S. waters. The 2008 Discharge Assessment Report suggested options like establishing BMP standards to reduce contaminants in hazardous wastes, prohibiting discharge into the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, increasing inspections on cruise ships. In the EPA report, options for addressing hazardous wastes from cruise ships include establishing BMP standards, prohibiting discharge into the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, and increasing inspections. Section 311 of the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances into U.S. waters. The Clean Water Act prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances from cruise ships into U.S. navigable waters or the contiguous zone. Coast Guard regulations restrict oil discharge within 12 miles from shore unless passed through an oil water separator. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the vessel is en route and the oil content is less than 100 ppm. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard. Coast Guard regulations require vessels to maintain an Oil Record Book for recording disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I on oil pollution, applying to all U.S. flagged and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard has regulations prohibiting oil discharge to implement APPS. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) enforces MARPOL Annex I on oil pollution for U.S. and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, but have limited impact on cruise ship operations due to foreign registration. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) enforces MARPOL Annex I on oil pollution for U.S. and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters, prohibiting oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land. However, most cruise lines, being foreign registered, have limited applicability to APPS regulations. Cruise lines have policies restricting discharges of machinery space waste within three miles from shore. EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. The EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, including establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet specified standards, and imposing penalties for noncompliance. Clean Water Act regulations have historically exempted ballast water and other incidental discharges from regulation. In response to the growing issue of invasive species introduced into U.S. waters via ballast water, in January 1999, various organizations petitioned the EPA to repeal its 1973 regulation exempting ballast water from NPDES permit requirements. In January 1999, organizations petitioned the EPA to repeal the 1973 regulation exempting ballast water from NPDES permit requirements due to the issue of invasive species introduction into U.S. waters. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, citing the \"normal operation\" exclusion as a long-standing policy. The EPA rejected a petition in September 2003 to repeal its 1973 regulation exempting ballast water discharge, stating that the \"normal operation\" exclusion is a long-standing policy. EPA believes other federal activities are more effective in controlling invasive species in ballast water. The EPA rejected a petition in 2003 to repeal its regulation exempting ballast water discharge, citing other federal activities as more effective in controlling invasive species. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges by vessels became mandatory in 2004, except in the Great Lakes. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit seeking to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges by vessels became mandatory in 2004, except in the Great Lakes. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit seeking to force EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting. In 2005, a federal district court ruled in favor of the groups, ordering the challenged regulation to be set aside by September 30, 2008. The ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2008. The court ruled in favor of environmental groups, ordering EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting by September 30, 2008. The ruling applies to other vessel discharges covered by the exemption for \"discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels.\" The court's ruling ordered EPA to rescind the exemption for ballast water discharges, which also applies to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. EPA issued the Vessel General Permit in response, affecting a wide range of large recreational and commercial vessels. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) issued by the EPA in response to a court order applies to an estimated 69,000 large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. It covers pollutant discharges incidental to normal operation from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, as well as ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) issued by the EPA applies to foreign flagged cruise ships carrying over 100 passengers. It covers pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. The permit applies to discharges into U.S. waters within the 3-mile territorial limit, identifying 26 types of waste streams from covered vessels. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) issued by the EPA applies to discharges into U.S. waters within the 3-mile territorial limit from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length. The permit covers 26 types of waste streams, including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and pollutants with toxic effects, which are controlled by best management practices described in the permit. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length into U.S. waters within a 3-mile territorial limit. Waste streams such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and toxic pollutants are controlled by best management practices outlined in the permit. Ballast water discharges are managed through Coast Guard requirements and bilge water discharges through BMPs. The VGP primarily relies on existing Coast Guard requirements for controlling ballast water discharges and provides BMPs for managing bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements apply, while sewage discharges from vessels are regulated separately under CWA Section 312. The draft VGP includes BMPs consistent with current rules and industry practice, with monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. It does not cover sewage discharges regulated under CWA Section 312 or toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships. Cruise ships have detailed requirements for certain discharges like graywater and pool water, along with additional monitoring and reporting. The VGP regulates cruise ship discharges, including graywater and pool water, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits. It also includes operational limits for graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. The VGP regulates cruise ship discharges, including graywater and pool water, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits. It also includes operational limits on cruise ship graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters, such as Chesapeake Bay or Puget Sound. The 110th Congress considered legislation on ballast water discharge issues. The 110th Congress considered legislation on ballast water discharge issues, including S. 1578 and H.R. 2830, which aimed to provide a national approach for addressing aquatic nuisance species. Some groups opposed the legislation due to concerns about preempting states' ability to enact stricter ballast water management programs. The 110th Congress considered legislation on ballast water discharge issues, including S. 1578 and H.R. 2830, which aimed to provide a national approach for addressing aquatic nuisance species. Some groups opposed the legislation due to concerns about preempting states' ability to enact stricter ballast water management programs. The legislation did not include citizen suit provisions and no further action was taken. The Clean Water Act allows citizen suits to enforce the law, but recent legislation did not include citizen suit provisions. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality, setting standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until EPA established standards for marine diesel engines in 2003. The EPA established emission standards for marine diesel engines on large vessels in 2003, including cruise ships, following a settlement with the environmental group Bluewater Network. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships flagged in the United States in 2003. The rule was a result of litigation with the environmental group Bluewater Network, who petitioned for stringent emission standards. These standards are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards in Annex VI of the MARPOL protocol for nitrogen oxides. This regulation marked the first time emissions from these ocean-going vessels were subject to EPA regulation. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships in 2003, meeting internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides. This regulation marked the first time emissions from these ocean-going vessels were subject to EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels in 2003 under the Clean Air Act, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. The rule aimed to meet internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides and set the stage for future regulations on very large marine engines and vessels. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels in 2003 under the Clean Air Act, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. The rule aimed to meet internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides and set the stage for future regulations on very large marine engines and vessels. EPA later planned to implement more stringent emission standards for very large marine engines and vessels, considering international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, but the rules were upheld in federal court in June 2004. EPA stated it would consider including foreign vessels in the future. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels in 2003 under the Clean Air Act, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. Environmental groups criticized EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, but the rules were upheld in federal court in June 2004. EPA said it would consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for more stringent standards. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and in October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide standards. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, concerning air pollution control from vessels. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. The United States supported the amendments during IMO negotiations. EPA also promulgated changes to the 2003 CAA rules for emission controls. The United States supported stringent new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards starting in 2011 and 2012, respectively, along with more emission controls in designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs). EPA also implemented changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with IMO requirements, including standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The regulations apply to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged or registered vessels. EPA implemented changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with amended IMO requirements, establishing emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged or registered vessels, while engines on foreign vessels are subject to nitrogen oxide limits under MARPOL Annex VI. The EPA implemented changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with amended IMO requirements. Engines on foreign vessels are subject to nitrogen oxide limits under MARPOL Annex VI, which the United States can enforce through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS). In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA, with more stringent emission limitations for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter starting in 2014. A treaty amendment to Annex VI will be circulated among IMO members for approval by July 2011, imposing stricter emission limits on ships in the designated area around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands starting in 2014. Various laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas, such as the Clean Water Act's treatment of navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as separate entities. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters as the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. In 1988, President Reagan extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles from the U.S. baseline. The territorial seas are defined as extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. In 1988, President Reagan extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles from the U.S. baseline, but this had no effect on the Clean Water Act's geographic reach. The contiguous zone is defined as the entire zone established by the United States under a specific convention. President Clinton's proclamation in 1999 extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the previous limit. President Clinton's 1999 proclamation extended U.S. enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the previous limit set by the 12-mile contiguous zone definition. This did not change the statutory definition of the territorial sea, which remains at 3 miles wide. President Clinton's 1999 proclamation extended U.S. enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile width of the contiguous zone. This did not change the statutory definition of the territorial sea, which remains at 3 miles wide. Under CERCLA, \"navigable waters\" include waters of the United States, territorial seas, and contiguous zones. The CWA defines the \"ocean\" as the high seas beyond the contiguous zone, while the MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas beyond the baseline of the territorial sea. Limits of jurisdiction are crucial for defining specific areas. The MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas lying seaward beyond the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured. Limits of jurisdiction are important for defining areas where specific laws apply, such as the Clean Water Act MSD standards for sewage discharges from vessels into navigable waters. Section 311 of the CWA addresses discharges of oil. The Clean Water Act and other related laws define areas where specific regulations apply, such as sewage discharge standards for vessels and permits for point source discharges into navigable waters. The Oil Pollution Act addresses oil or hazardous substance discharges into US waters, while the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships covers discharges of oil and noxious substances. The Oil Pollution Act and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships regulate discharges of oil and hazardous substances into navigable waters of the United States. The MPRSA governs ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline and material transport by U.S.-flagged vessels for dumping into ocean waters. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline and material transport by U.S.-flagged vessels for dumping into ocean waters. Jurisdictional considerations are complicated by differences in how distances from shore are defined in various laws and proclamations. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has garnered attention due to its impact on tourism and commercial fisheries. The Clean Water Act, APPS, MPRSA, and presidential proclamations use different measures for distances from shore, with a nautical mile being 15% longer than an international mile. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to its impact on tourism and fisheries. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties of $6.5 million in a federal criminal plea agreement for environmental violations in July 1999. During the 1990s, Alaska saw a three-fold increase in cruise ship passengers, leading to concerns over pollution impacts on marine resources. In July 1999, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines pleaded guilty to federal environmental violations, including knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska, resulting in $6.5 million in penalties. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines admitted to violating environmental regulations in Alaska, leading to $6.5 million in penalties for discharging oil and hazardous substances. This was part of a larger $18 million federal plea agreement for violations in multiple locations. Public concern prompted the state to start a program in 1999 to monitor cruise ship waste streams, revealing issues with waste treatment systems on most ships. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for environmental violations in Alaska and other locations, leading to a federal plea agreement. Concerns about the violations prompted a program to monitor cruise ship waste streams, revealing significant issues with waste treatment systems on most ships. Sampling showed that discharges exceeded U.S. Coast Guard standards for Type II MSDs, with high levels of fecal coliform in blackwater and graywater. Treatment systems on most ships did not function well, leading to discharges that greatly exceeded U.S. Coast Guard standards for Type II MSDs. Fecal coliform levels in blackwater and graywater were far above the acceptable limits. Federal legislation was passed in December 2000 to address these issues, following growing regional concerns about cruise ship waste management. Federal legislation passed in December 2000 addressed concerns about cruise ship waste management by establishing standards for vessels with 500 or more overnight passengers, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in Alaska's navigable waters, and authorizing the EPA to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships in these waters. EPA regulations are pending. The law established standards for vessels with 500 or more overnight passengers, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in Alaska's navigable waters. EPA is authorized to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships in these waters. Cruise ships can discharge treated sewage wastes in Alaska waters under specific conditions. Until EPA issues regulations, cruise ships in Alaska can discharge treated sewage wastes at least 1 nautical mile from shore while traveling 6 knots, with limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. Vessels with advanced systems can discharge treated sewage and graywater within one mile from shore and at speeds less than 6 knots, meeting stricter effluent standards. The legislation allows vessels with advanced systems to discharge treated sewage and graywater within one mile from shore at speeds less than 6 knots, meeting strict effluent standards. Vessels must adhere to specific effluent standards, including limits on fecal coliforms, total suspended solids, and residual chlorine concentrations. Coast Guard oversight and enforcement require sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators. Regulations have been issued by the Coast Guard to implement the federal law. The legislation mandates strict effluent standards for vessel discharge, including limits on fecal coliforms, total suspended solids, and residual chlorine concentrations. Coast Guard oversight requires sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by operators. Regulations were issued in 2001 to enforce the law, with penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to assess system performance. The EPA issued regulations in 2001 to implement federal law for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. The rules include sampling and testing procedures, as well as penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems and determine if revised standards are needed. The EPA conducted a project in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate treatment systems on cruise ships in Alaska and determine if revised standards for sewage and graywater discharges are necessary. Data collected was summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. Additionally, a survey on the effectiveness and costs of treatment devices for large cruise vessels was distributed in 2004. The EPA conducted a project in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate treatment systems on cruise ships in Alaska and determine if revised standards for sewage and graywater discharges are necessary. Data collected was summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. Additionally, a survey on the effectiveness, costs, and impacts of treatment devices for large cruise vessels was distributed in 2004. Sampling efforts in collaboration with the state of Alaska included a cruise ship plume tracking survey in 2001 and a study in Skagway Harbor in 2008 to estimate the effectiveness of advanced wastewater treatment systems in treating sewage and graywater discharges from docked cruise ships. The EPA collaborated with Alaska on a cruise ship plume tracking survey in 2001 and a study in Skagway Harbor in 2008 to estimate the effectiveness of advanced wastewater treatment systems in treating sewage and graywater discharges from docked cruise ships. Sampling efforts showed that these systems are effective in treating various pollutants. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to set standards for cruise ship discharges. Treatment systems are effective in treating various pollutants, and Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to set standards for cruise ship discharges, including blackwater and graywater. Sampling requirements for all ships were implemented. The state law in Alaska sets standards and sampling requirements for blackwater and graywater discharges from ships, aligning with federal regulations. Effluent standards for large cruise ships' blackwater discharges were implemented in 2001, followed by graywater discharges in 2003. Small ships were given three years to comply with the regulations. Sampling requirements for all ships were implemented in 2001, along with effluent standards for blackwater discharges by large cruise ships. Graywater discharge standards for large vessels followed in 2003. Small ships had three years to comply with the regulations. Additionally, a scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness and advise on cruise ship impacts on the Alaskan environment and public health. The law required large cruise ships to comply with effluent standards within three years. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness in addressing cruise ship impacts on the Alaskan environment and public health. By 2006, 23 out of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters had installed advanced wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards. As of 2006, 23 out of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters had installed advanced wastewater treatment systems to meet effluent standards. Small ships have not upgraded their systems, leading to consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state water quality standards. Small ships in Alaskan waters have not upgraded their wastewater treatment systems, leading to consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state water quality standards, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. In response to the consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state water quality standards from smaller vessels in Alaskan waters, the state took action in 2001. Test results showed elevated levels of free chlorine, fecal coliform, copper, and zinc, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay a $50 head tax per passenger, corporate income tax, increased fines for wastewater violations, and new environmental regulations for cruise ships. In August 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative mandating cruise lines to pay a $50 head tax per passenger, corporate income tax, and adhere to new environmental regulations. Revenues from the taxes will benefit local communities and public services. Supporters argue that the cruise industry needs to pay more for environmental harm, while opponents fear it will harm Alaska's tourism competitiveness. The taxes from the citizen initiative in Alaska will benefit local communities and public services, aiming to compensate for the cruise industry's environmental impact. However, opponents fear it may harm Alaska's tourism competitiveness, leading to legal challenges and some cruise lines halting operations in Alaskan waters. In 2009, Alaska enacted legislation (HB 134) to give more time for implementing stringent wastewater treatment standards for cruise ships. Legal challenges have been filed against the tax in federal court, leading to some cruise lines halting operations in Alaskan waters. Maine also enacted legislation in 2004 to regulate cruise ship discharges. In 2004, Maine enacted legislation (Maine LD. 1158) to regulate discharges from large cruise ships into coastal waters, requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems for ships entering state waters after January 1, 2006. Maine LD. 1158 regulates discharges from large cruise ships into coastal waters, requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems for ships entering state waters after January 1, 2006. The legislation applies to ships with overnight accommodations for 250 or more passengers and mandates compliance with discharge and recordkeeping requirements under federal law. Ships must also obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater dischargers were allowed if ships operated treatment systems meeting Alaska federal and state laws. The federal Alaska cruise ship law requires ships to have advanced wastewater treatment systems and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater dischargers were allowed if ships met treatment system requirements. Maine gained federal authorization to prohibit blackwater discharges into state waters by applying for No Discharge Zones. California enacted laws in 2004 to prohibit cruise ships from discharging treated wastewater in state waters. In 2006, Maine gained federal authorization to prohibit blackwater discharges by applying for No Discharge Zones. California enacted laws in 2004 to ban cruise ships from releasing treated wastewater, graywater, and operating waste incinerators. Additionally, California passed laws in 2003 to prohibit passenger ships from discharging sewage sludge and oil bilge water. California has implemented several laws to regulate wastewater discharge in its waters. These include bans on releasing graywater, operating waste incinerators on vessels, discharging sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes from photo-processing and dry cleaning operations. California also requires the adoption of ballast water performance standards by January 2008. California has enacted laws such as A.B. 121 and A.B. 906 to prohibit the discharge of hazardous wastes from photo-processing and dry cleaning operations into state waters. S.B. 497 mandates the adoption of ballast water performance standards by January 2008, with specific deadlines for removing invasive species by 2020. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the cruise industry to adhere to similar regulations. The cruise industry has agreements with states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii to adhere to waste minimization, recycling, and waste management practices. Cruise lines must eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast of Florida and report hazardous waste off-loaded in the United States. Cruise ships must adhere to waste minimization, recycling, and waste management practices. Agreements with states like Florida and Washington require eliminating wastewater discharges within a certain distance from the coast and reporting hazardous waste off-loaded in the United States. Cruise ships must comply with waste management practices and agreements with states like Florida and Washington. The Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum of understanding in April 2004 to regulate wastewater discharge from cruise ships. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement measures. The memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle regulates wastewater discharge from cruise ships. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement measures, but states argue that federal law allows for more rigorous requirements in such agreements. In 2009, the Department of Ecology reported that cruise ships visiting the state mostly complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater. The Clean Water Act limits a state's control over cruise ship discharges, but federal law allows states to make voluntary agreements with stricter requirements. In 2009, the Department of Ecology found that cruise ships in Washington mostly complied with an MOU to stop untreated wastewater discharge, with treatment systems producing high-quality effluent. Enforcement of voluntary agreements is challenging, but having measures in place benefits water quality and provides data on vessels. The MOU aims to stop discharging untreated wastewater from cruise ships, with treatment systems producing high-quality effluent. Enforcement of the voluntary agreement is challenging, but it benefits water quality and provides data on vessels. Pressure from environmental advocates and the industry's desire to promote a positive image have led to initiatives by the Cruise Lines International Association. The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) has adopted waste management practices and procedures for their global operations, following regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA. These guidelines require discharge of graywater and blackwater only while the ship is at least 4 miles from shore, and hazardous wastes must be recycled or disposed of properly. The largest cruise lines have adopted waste management practices following regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA. Guidelines require discharge of graywater and blackwater at least 4 miles from shore, and hazardous wastes must be recycled or disposed of properly. CLIA's cruise line companies have implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems certified by the IMO. The cruise industry has adopted waste management practices in compliance with regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA. Safety Management System plans have been implemented for enhanced wastewater systems, certified by the IMO. Collaboration with equipment manufacturers and regulators is ongoing to develop technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups appreciate the industry's voluntary adoption of improved practices but advocate for enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The cruise industry is collaborating with equipment manufacturers and regulators to develop and test technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones, despite industry efforts to adopt improved practices. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas. The cruise industry, in collaboration with Conservation International, announced conservation efforts to protect biodiversity in coastal areas. This includes improving wastewater management on cruise ships, working with local governments to preserve cruise destinations, raising awareness among passengers and crew, and educating vendors to reduce environmental impacts. In collaboration with Conservation International, the cruise industry is implementing technology for wastewater management on cruise ships, protecting natural and cultural assets of cruise destinations, raising awareness of conservation issues among passengers and crew, and educating vendors to reduce environmental impacts. CLIA and CI launched a joint initiative in 2006 to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect marine and coastal ecosystems. In 2006, CLIA and CI announced a joint initiative to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect critical marine and coastal ecosystems. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) committed to retrofitting all vessels in its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so. This initiative aimed to protect the ocean environment and set a model for others in the industry. Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) plans to retrofit its entire 29-ship fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology, making it the first cruise line to commit to this. The company's efforts to improve environmental practices follow past federal enforcement actions in the 1990s, where RCCL paid $27 million in criminal fines. This move raises concerns about cruise ship pollution and the adequacy of laws. Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

The company's efforts to improve environmental practices follow past federal enforcement actions in the 1990s, where RCCL paid $27 million in criminal fines. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement. More assessment is needed to determine if current steps are adequate. The need for more assessment of laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement in addressing cruise ship pollution is highlighted. It is questioned whether existing measures are sufficient or if legislative changes are necessary to address gaps and strengthen current protocols. The challenge lies in determining if current laws and regulations adequately manage cruise ship pollution, particularly in areas like graywater. Legislative changes may be necessary to address gaps and strengthen existing requirements. The EPA has identified gaps in regulations regarding cruise ship waste streams, with graywater being a particular concern due to contamination with fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics. Testing has shown higher levels of fecal coliform in graywater from ships' galley and sink waste streams compared to sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels to address contamination issues like fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics in cruise ship graywater. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended strengthened requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including uniform discharge standards, waste management procedures, recordkeeping, sampling, testing, monitoring, and incentives for industry investment in innovative treatment. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended Congress establish a new statutory regime for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including uniform standards, recordkeeping, sampling, testing, and incentives for industry investment. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed similar measures but did not progress in Congress. The Clean Cruise Ship Act, introduced in the 111th Congress, aimed to amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting specific effluent limits and management standards. EPA and the Coast Guard would be tasked with establishing stringent effluent limits for these discharges. The Clean Cruise Ship Act aims to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting specific effluent limits and management standards. The legislation would require cruise ships to treat wastewater and authorize federal enforcement authority for inspection, sampling, and testing. Passenger fees would fund implementation by EPA and the Coast Guard. The proposed legislation under the Clean Cruise Ship Act would enforce strict wastewater treatment standards on cruise ships, with federal authority for inspection and testing. Passenger fees would support implementation by EPA and the Coast Guard. Industry groups argue that the legislation unfairly targets a small percentage of ships with already high environmental standards. Environmental advocates and industry groups have differing views on the proposed Clean Cruise Ship Act. Advocates support the legislation, while industry groups argue that the industry already meets or exceeds environmental standards. Some states have passed laws regulating cruise ship discharges, prompting the possibility of federal legislation to harmonize state approaches. Congress is also monitoring EPA's efforts in this area. The Clean Cruise Ship Act is supported by environmental advocates, while industry groups argue that current regulations are sufficient. Some states have laws regulating cruise ship discharges, potentially leading to federal legislation to align state approaches. Congress is also monitoring EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes. Congress is monitoring EPA's efforts to regulate cruise ship wastes. EPA has collected information and assessed the need for additional standards but has not yet proposed any rules. In December 2008, EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report examining various waste streams from cruise ships. In December 2008, EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report that examines five cruise ship waste streams and discusses current federal government actions to address them. The report identifies possible options and alternatives for each waste stream but states that EPA has not determined the necessity, feasibility, or legal authority for any of the options. The federal government is addressing cruise ship waste streams, but EPA has not determined the necessity, feasibility, or legal authority for any options. Issues include harmonizing U.S. laws for cruise ships and defining \"cruise ship\" consistently. The federal government is considering addressing cruise ship waste streams, but EPA has not determined the legal authority for implementing options. Key issues include harmonizing U.S. laws for cruise ships and defining \"cruise ship\" consistently. Additional research is needed to understand waste quantities generated. The federal government is considering addressing cruise ship waste streams, but EPA has not determined the legal authority for implementing options. Research is needed to understand waste quantities generated by cruise ships and the potential for new control technologies. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in identifying the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritizing resources. Research directions include studying pollutant transport in the marine environment, impacts of small passenger vessel practices, and disposal options for waste. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy emphasized the need for research to address vessel pollution threats. Research directions include studying pollutant transport in the marine environment, impacts of small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for waste, and cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems. Research is needed to address vessel pollution threats, including impacts of stationary discharges, disposal options for concentrated sludge from sewage treatment on large passenger vessels, cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems, and vessel air emissions in ports and inland waterways. EPA's 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report suggested research options such as a nationwide sampling program and studies on human health and environmental effects. The 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report by EPA suggested research options to address vessel pollution threats, including establishing a nationwide sampling program, studying human health and environmental effects, and assessing potential cumulative impacts from multiple cruise ships. EPA also highlighted the need for research in geographic areas impacted by cruise ship discharges and in semi-enclosed environments like bays and harbors. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for monitoring cruise ship discharges to evaluate current standards and management effectiveness. It also emphasized the necessity for increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard and other agencies. The GAO emphasized the need for increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard and other agencies to monitor discharges and enforce regulations. Increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard and other agencies is necessary for maintenance and operation of pollution prevention equipment, monitoring oil record books for MARPOL compliance, and ensuring proper off-loading of waste. The Coast Guard's resources for enforcement of pollution regulations, including vessel inspections, have been questioned, especially in light of multiple security missions. The Coast Guard's resources for enforcing pollution regulations on cruise ships, including vessel inspections, have been questioned due to multiple security missions. EPA suggests options for improving monitoring and inspections to ensure compliance. The GAO's 2000 report raised questions about the Coast Guard's expanded responsibilities for homeland security and its impact on operations. EPA has suggested various options for enforcing compliance on cruise ships, including improving monitoring, inspections, and implementing passenger fees for onboard observation of waste treatment practices. The GAO's 2000 report highlighted issues with enforcing compliance on cruise ships, such as inadequate referral processes for pollution violations. Recommendations included improving monitoring, inspections, and collaborating with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases. The GAO recommended that the Coast Guard collaborate with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases and make greater efforts to follow up on alleged pollution cases occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction."
