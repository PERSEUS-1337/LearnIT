    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption varies annually in response to mission changes. DOD may consume up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) purchases fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II under the Army-Navy Petroleum Board. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), under the command of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), purchases fuel for all DOD services and agencies in the US and overseas. DESC's origins date back to World War II and it became part of the Defense Logistics Agency in 1962. In 1964, it was designated the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) to manage DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1964, the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) was established to manage DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it was renamed the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded mission to manage a variety of energy products. The DESC typically awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost for one-year lengths. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) manages a portfolio of energy products and awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery. DOD is the largest consumer of petroleum products, primarily JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. The Defense Energy Support Center manages energy products and awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery. DOD is the largest consumer of petroleum products, primarily JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases over the current decade (FY2000 through FY2008) and compares fuel spending to overall DOD spending, prices paid for fuel, and quantities purchased compared to U.S. refined petroleum products production. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices paid for fuel, and quantities purchased compared to U.S. refined petroleum products production. It also discusses refining, refineries supplying DOD's jet fuel, DESC's fuel procurement practices, recent legislation, and policies affecting fuel procurement. The report discusses DOD's fuel procurement practices, recent legislation directing the consideration of alternative fuels, and stimulating commercial interest in supplying fuel needs. High fuel prices have prompted interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying the needs. High fuel prices have prompted interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, although no project has reached commercial operation yet. Legislation now ensures that federal agencies do not spend taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules for greenhouse gas emission reporting may have minimal effects on refineries. Legislation now prevents federal agencies from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules for greenhouse gas reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. DOD's fuel consumption varies yearly based on mission changes. DESC primarily purchases JP-8 jet fuel. The legislation introduced to cap greenhouse gas emissions may impact refinery operations and the DOD's fuel requirements. DESC's bulk fuel purchases primarily consist of JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army being the main consumers. The Navy consumes JP-5 jet fuel, and all services use diesel fuel to varying degrees. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 at 145.1 million barrels. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003, with JP-8 representing almost 60% of overall purchases in FY2000 and declining to 46% by FY2008. Overall DESC fuel expenditures increased from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008\u2014a nearly 500% rise. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003, with JP-8 representing almost 60% of purchases in FY2000 and declining to 46% by FY2008. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008\u2014a 500% increase. DESC's fuel purchases increased by 500% from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% during the same period. DOD's purchases may not align with actual consumption as fuel may be drawn from storage or war reserves. Despite leveling off consumption after the Iraq war, fuel costs continued to rise due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. The Department of Defense's fuel purchases increased significantly from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, despite only a 30% increase in actual volumes purchased. DOD maintains a fuel \"war reserve\" for contingencies, with fuel costs rising due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. Average petroleum product costs rose from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, a 370% increase. Earlier, JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuels had a price advantage over Jet A fuel, but this changed after commercial aviation setbacks post-9/11. The average cost of petroleum products purchased by the Department of Defense increased significantly from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, a 370% increase. Jet and diesel fuel prices also rose during this period, leading to an increase in refining margins. After aviation setbacks post-9/11 and the Iraq invasion in 2003, military jet fuel price advantages reversed. Fuel prices increased, widening the margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices. DOD responded by purchasing alternate jet fuels to offset decreasing JP-8 purchases. The Department of Defense (DOD) responded to increasing fuel prices by purchasing alternate jet fuels and increasing diesel fuel purchases. DESC offset decreasing JP-8 purchases with commercial aviation specification fuels. Outlays represent cash payments made to liquidate government obligations in a fiscal year. Total defense outlays increased by 200% from FY2000 through FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending increasing by 231%. Fuel costs also rose, leading to the Department of Defense purchasing alternate jet fuels and increasing diesel fuel purchases. From FY2000 through FY2007, total defense outlays increased by 200%, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497%, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, relying on Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico for the rest. Fuel costs increased by 497% from FY2000 to FY2008, representing 1.2% of DOD's spending in FY2000 and doubling to 3% by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil and relies on other countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico for the rest. The U.S. relies on Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria, and other producers for crude oil supply. Refineries are shifting to heavier sour crudes due to diminishing sweet crude supply. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is the benchmark for pricing U.S. domestic crudes and oil imports. Crude oil components separate into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Refineries are increasingly turning to heavier sour crudes due to the diminishing supply of sweet crudes. Crude oil components separate into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel during the refining process. Many refineries now process the residuum left after atmospheric distillation into gasoline and middle distillate range products using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Refineries process crude oil components into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel. The term \"straight-run\" refers to products that condense during initial refining. Residuum from atmospheric distillation is further processed using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts to produce various products like kerosene/jet fuel and diesel fuel. Specifications for jet fuel, especially military grade, are more stringent than for kerosene. Refineries are designed to process specific grades of crude oil. Refineries process crude oil into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Specifications for jet fuel, especially military grade, are more stringent than for kerosene. Refineries are designed to process specific grades of crude oil, with light sweet crude being desirable for gasoline refining due to its easier refinement process. Refineries are set up to process specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refinement process. Topping refineries separate crude oil through distillation, while hydroskimming refineries are more complex and include processes for sulfur treatment. Refineries may be set up in different configurations: Topping refineries separate crude oil through distillation, producing naphtha but no gasoline. Hydroskimming refineries are more complex, running light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking to run light sour crude for light and middle distillates. Coking refineries are high conversion refineries that use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. Coking refineries are high conversion refineries that use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. Refineries' atmospheric distillation capacity sets the limit of crude oil processing, with secondary processing units like catalytic cracking and coking increasing output volume. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries, measuring their relative size and complexity. It varies from 2 for hydroskimming refineries to over 9 for coking refineries. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the complexity of refineries based on secondary processes compared to primary distillation capacity. It ranges from 2 for hydroskimming refineries to over 9 for coking refineries. Gulf Coast refineries with an average complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. The Nelson Complexity Index rates refinery complexity based on secondary processes, ranging from 2 for hydroskimming to over 9 for coking refineries. Gulf Coast refineries with complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries are upgrading processes to handle heavier crude oils and reduce sulfur content in diesel fuel by EPA regulations. Changes in crude oil supplies have prompted refineries to upgrade processes to handle heavier sour crude oils and reduce sulfur content in diesel fuel to meet EPA regulations. By the end of 2010, all highway-use diesel fuel in the US will be limited to 15 ppm sulfur, termed \"ultra-low sulfur diesel\" (ULSD). EPA regulations require measuring sulfur content at retail outlets, not refineries. Petroleum product pipelines transport various fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. In the late 1980s, DOD adopted regulations limiting sulfur content in diesel fuel to 15 ppm, known as \"ultra-low sulfur diesel\" (ULSD). Refiners must produce lower sulfur diesel to prevent contamination during pipeline transit. In the late 1980s, DOD adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, using JP-8 for land-based equipment instead of diesel fuel. Refiners face challenges with contaminated \"transmix\" between gasoline and diesel in pipelines. The DOD adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept in the late 1980s, using JP-8 for land-based equipment instead of diesel fuel to minimize the fuel supply chain length. The U.S. Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8, which can expose vehicles to fuel with elevated sulfur levels. The U.S. Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8, which may contain elevated sulfur levels. The sulfur content in JP-8 is limited to 3,000 ppm by ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E, with a typical content of 140 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the sulfur content of most kerosene as 400 ppm. The U.S. Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with a typical content of 140 ppm. EPA guidelines acknowledge the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel in the U.S. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. The U.S. Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with a typical content of 140 ppm. Guidelines for Tactical Vehicle Engines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel in the U.S. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles, leading to a proposed finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution. The EPA issued a proposed finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution, leading to wide-ranging implications. Recently, the EPA proposed a Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule for petroleum refineries to report emissions, which emit approximately 205 million metric tons of CO2 annually. The EPA's proposed Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule would require petroleum refineries to report emissions, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations on capping emissions. The EPA's proposed Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule would require petroleum refineries to report emissions, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations on capping emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Legislation like H.R. 2454 aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with provisions that would gradually reduce emissions from refineries. Legislation like H.R. 2454 aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping emissions from refineries and allowing trading of emissions permits. The provisions of H.R. 2454 would gradually reduce the cap on emissions, forcing industries to reduce emissions by 83% or purchase allowances from others. Currently, there are 142 refineries operating in the United States. The provisions of H.R. 2454 would reduce the cap on emissions to 83%, requiring industries to cut emissions by that amount or buy allowances from others. There are currently 142 refineries in the United States, with top suppliers including Shell, Valero, ExxonMobil, and BP. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported that its top domestic suppliers included Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation, operating 31 refineries in the United States with nearly 6 million barrels per day of crude capacity. Not all may supply jet fuel to DOD, however. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141, but the atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased from 17.8 million to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. This increase is partly due to the rise in diesel fuel capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day. The number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, but the atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The increase is partly due to the rise in diesel fuel capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day. The median capacity of currently operating refineries is around 80,000 bpd, with 70 refineries above this making up 85% of U.S. refining capacity. The downstream charge capacity for kerosene/jet fuel is around 1 million barrels per day, with Gulf Coast refineries yielding up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. Gulf Coast refineries yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of U.S. net production, making up less than 1% of all U.S. refined petroleum products. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded the U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years, with U.S. refineries supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases. The current capacity of U.S. refineries does not meet all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel, leading DESC to increase its purchase of commercial jet fuels. DESC's jet fuel purchases have surpassed U.S. refining industry output in recent years. U.S. refineries supply less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases, leading to an increase in commercial jet fuel purchases. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending on fuel as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply chain to forward operating areas. DESC's jet fuel purchases have surpassed U.S. refining industry output in recent years. Commercial jet fuel prices are lower, reducing DESC's spending on fuel. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply chain to forward operating areas like Iraq or Afghanistan. Logistics demand that closer refineries supply the fuel, with DESC also purchasing from foreign suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. DESC purchases jet fuel from both U.S. and foreign suppliers to support U.S. forces in areas like Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD's authority to procure fuel stems from the Navy's power, allowing them to buy the best fuel for their needs. The Navy's authority to procure fuel extends from its power granted by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229, allowing them to buy the best fuel for their needs. DESC now relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 for fuel purchases. DESC now relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 for fuel purchases, allowing DOD to buy supplies and services. DESC awards contracts and purchases fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund, transferring fuel internally to DOD customers for cost savings. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) utilizes the authority to procure a wide range of supplies and services, including fuel purchases under the Defense Working Capital Fund. This process allows for cost savings through large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for DOD customers during the fiscal year. Acquisition, as defined by Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403, involves acquiring property or services with appropriated funds to support executive agency missions and goals. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) utilizes procurement authority for large quantity purchases, providing stabilized prices for DOD customers. Acquisition, as defined by Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403, involves acquiring property or services with appropriated funds to support agency missions. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs the Armed Forces acquisition process. The term \"procurement\" encompasses all stages of acquiring property or services, from identifying a need to completing the contract. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs the military acquisition process, while the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR outlines federal agency acquisition regulations. The Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) in 48 CFR is specific to the Department of Defense.

DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with an economic price adjustment. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with an economic price adjustment provision. This provision allows for upward and downward revision of the contract price based on specified contingencies, utilizing clauses at FAR 52.216\u20132. Economic price adjustment provisions are used when future costs are unpredictable, especially for refined petroleum products. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for refined petroleum products due to unpredictable future costs. They have adopted contracting instructions for multi-year contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station services. DESC adopted contracting instructions for multi-year contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station services, eligible under FAR17.105-1(b) and DFARS 217.170(a). DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding twenty years. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. A \"multiyear contract\" is a contract for supplies or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years, contingent upon fund appropriation. A multiyear contract allows for the purchase of supplies or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Performance in subsequent years is contingent upon fund appropriation, with a possible cancellation payment if funds are not allocated. The key difference between a multiyear contract and a multiple year contract is that the former covers multiple years' requirements without needing to exercise options each year, while the latter simply has a term of more than one year. Multiyear contracts allow for the purchase of supplies or services for multiple years without needing to exercise options each year. The authority for multiyear contracts for supplies comes from general procurement statutes. Multiyear contract authority for supplies allows DOD agencies to enter into contracts for multiple years to promote national security and achieve cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the agency must cancel the contract. The DOD may enter into multiyear contracts for supplies to promote national security and achieve cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged to take advantage of lower costs and other objectives. The DOD can enter into multiyear contracts for supplies to promote national security and achieve cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged to take advantage of lower costs and other objectives. The multiyear contract cannot exceed $500 million until the Secretary of Defense identifies the contract and any extension in a report submitted to the congressional defense committees. The DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including through multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has broad waiver authority over the acquisition of alternative fuels. The DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including through multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has broad waiver authority over the acquisition of alternative fuels, allowing for flexibility in contracts and terms based on market conditions. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to waive provisions of law regarding contracts for alternative fuels if market conditions impact DOD's acquisition. The term \"defined fuel source\" includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived by the Secretary if necessary. DESC has not made a determination on this matter. The term \"fuel source\" includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived by the Secretary if necessary, but DESC has not decided on this yet. DESC has not determined whether it could waive statutory limits on multiyear contracts, as it is unclear if DDO or Congress would agree. DESC bases contract delivery price on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government and includes a surcharge for operating costs. DESC determines contract delivery price based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, including a surcharge for operating costs. Fuel is redistributed to bases from Defense Fuel Supply Points, with additional costs for tactical delivery incurred by operational commands. Previously, hidden costs were not factored into DOD fuel costs. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider fuel logistics costs, including hidden costs for tactical delivery methods like air-to-air refueling and ground transport. This ensures that new military capabilities factor in the fully burdened cost of fuel logistics in their acquisition processes. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 mandates that fuel logistics be included in acquisition processes, considering the fully burdened cost of fuel. A director is appointed to oversee energy requirements for military operations, as the Department of Defense faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 mandates considering fully burdened fuel costs in acquisition processes and appoints a director for overseeing energy requirements. The Department of Defense faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices, impacting funding for military operations and training. The Air Force experienced a 500% increase in fuel costs due to rising crude oil prices, leading to reduced funding for training aircrews. Fuel costs have been a significant portion of the Department of Defense's spending, impacting operations and maintenance budgets. Airlines also face high fuel costs but can adjust prices and schedules to mitigate the impact. Fuel costs have been a significant portion of the Department of Defense's spending, representing up to 3% of DOD's spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget in the past decade. Unlike the airline industry, DOD's only recourse during periods of high fuel costs has been to request supplemental appropriations to cover the increased costs. For example, in FY2007, DOD identified $0.5 billion in the Emergency Supplemental Request for baseline fuel cost increases. The Department of Defense has explored various options to reduce its vulnerability to fuel price fluctuations and supply shortages, such as fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels like commercial Jet A fuel. These measures have not only lowered fuel costs but also broadened the range of available supplies. DESC has implemented various strategies to reduce vulnerability to fuel price fluctuations and supply shortages, including fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using commercial Jet A fuel. These measures have not only lowered costs but also expanded supply options. DESC's business model with fixed-price contracts allows for flexibility to meet changing operational requirements. DESC's business model with fixed-price contracts provides flexibility to meet changing operational requirements by taking advantage of swings in fuel prices through an economic price adjustment clause. This strategy reduces DESC's risk in holding contracts for fuel priced above the market rate. DESC has a contract provision that adjusts fuel prices based on market rates, reducing risk. The airline industry uses hedging strategies like buying futures contracts to minimize future fuel price increases. The airline industry uses hedging strategies like buying futures contracts to minimize future fuel price increases. Southwest Airlines managed to hedge its fuel at $51/barrel when crude oil prices peaked at nearly $147 per barrel in 2008. Defense Business Board convened a Fuel Hedging Task Group in 2004 to reduce DOD's exposure to fuel price volatility. Southwest Airlines hedged fuel at $51/barrel when crude oil prices peaked at $147/barrel in 2008. The Defense Business Board's Fuel Hedging Task Group suggested DOD could hedge fuel purchases or engage in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service to offset increasing fuel costs during oil price spikes. The Board Task Group suggested that DOD could engage in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service to offset increasing fuel costs during oil price spikes. DOD could request legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on which department benefits from price changes. Interior's revenues mainly come from Outer Continental Shelf leases, which are already allocated by Congress. The Group suggested that DOD could request legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on which department benefits from price changes. Interior's revenues mainly come from Outer Continental Shelf leases, which are already allocated by Congress. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind in the form of oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. Congress has allocated revenues from Outer Continental Shelf leases among government accounts, including coastal states. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind with oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. The SPR, when filled to capacity, represents roughly 70 days of imported supply and can be drawn down through sales or exchanges under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. When filled to its 727 million barrel capacity, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) represents roughly 70 days of imported supply. A drawdown of the SPR under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can take the form of a sale to the highest bidder or an exchange. President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization during the 1991 Persian Gulf War led to a rapid crude oil price decline. Refineries processing heavy oil cannot operate at normal capacity if they rely on the SPR. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR. Refineries processing heavy oil would face capacity issues if they had to use SPR oil, leading to a potential 5% decrease in U.S. refining throughput. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not be fully effective during an oil disruption as many refineries are not compatible with the types of oil stored in the SPR. This could lead to a significant decrease in U.S. refining throughput, especially if the disruption involves heavy oil. The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption, but refineries under contract with DOD could potentially bid on a drawdown sale. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not be fully effective during an oil disruption, especially if it involves heavy oil. Refineries under contract with the Department of Defense (DOD) could bid on a drawdown sale, but their limited jet fuel production capacity hinders the SPR's role in supporting DOD's requirements. As a last resort, DOD may need to consider alternatives or replacements. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve's effectiveness during an oil disruption, particularly involving heavy oil, is limited due to refineries' low jet fuel production capacity. This hinders the SPR's ability to support Department of Defense requirements. As a final option, DOD may need to explore alternative or synthetic fuels, as mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless they have lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum sources. This provision aims to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans to develop coal-to-liquid fuels due to this regulation. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from purchasing alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum sources. This is to prevent taxpayer funding of new fuel sources that worsen global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans for coal-to-liquid fuels, but DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. Despite recent crude oil price declines, supply shortages and price spikes may still occur. Plans to attract private investment in a CTL fuel plant for Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, while DESC considers a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel needs in Alaska. Despite recent crude oil price declines, supply shortages and price spikes remain a concern. DOD is focusing on efficiency due to policy and economic constraints on fossil-based alternatives. Congress may need information on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) is shifting towards efficiency in response to policy and economic constraints on fossil-based alternatives. Congress may need information on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations and the lack of responsiveness from the refining sector to DOD's procurement announcements during periods of high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits in relation to the operation of marginally profitable refineries. The refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices raises concerns for Congress. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits compared to operating marginally profitable refineries, potentially leading to refinery shutdowns and a reduction in defense fuel suppliers. In the long term, Congress may be concerned about potential refinery shutdowns and a decrease in defense fuel suppliers. Background information on alternative fuel sources, greenhouse gas legislation, and aviation gasoline is available in various CRS reports. Oil Shale: History, Incentives, and Policy.
