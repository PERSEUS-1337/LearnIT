FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that United States workers at marine facilities and onboard vessels must carry a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Nearly two million transportation workers have obtained TWICs to date. Nearly two million transportation workers have applied for and received a TWIC, which is required by DHS regulations for access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated vessels and facilities. Applicants must pay $132.50 and make multiple trips to an enrollment center to obtain and activate their TWIC, which is valid for up to five years. To date, nearly two million transportation workers have applied for and received a TWIC, which costs $132.50. The TWIC is valid for up to five years, after which workers must request a new card by making additional trips to the enrollment center and paying $132.50 again. The TWIC card costs $132.50 and is valid for up to five years. Workers must make two or more trips to an enrollment center and pay $132.50 again to receive a new card. This process is time-consuming and expensive, especially if the nearest enrollment center is far from the worker's home. The requirement for multiple trips to the enrollment center is not mandated by statute. The TWIC enrollment process requires multiple time-consuming and costly trips to a distant enrollment center, not mandated by law but driven by DHS policy aligning with PIV standards for Federal employees. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with PIV standards for Federal employees, specifically FIPS-201, but DHS may deviate from this standard when necessary. Unlike other government credentials, TWIC may follow alternative approaches as deemed appropriate. (6) DHS generally aligns TWIC enrollment with FIPS-201 standard but may deviate when necessary. (7) TWIC is a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce, unlike other government credentials. (8) Possession of TWIC does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. The TWIC, aligned with the FIPS-201 standard, serves as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possession of a TWIC does not automatically grant access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has the authority to develop alternative enrollment processes that reduce the need for multiple trips to enrollment centers. DHS has the authority to develop alternative enrollment processes for TWIC that do not require multiple trips to enrollment centers. Other secure identity documents can be mailed to applicants. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers by August 2010, which has not been issued yet. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress emphasizes the need for urgent reform of the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should mandate the deployment of TWIC readers promptly for security purposes. The Secretary of Homeland Security should promptly mandate the deployment of TWIC readers to ensure security. Funds awarded for TWIC projects under the Port Security Grant Program should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. SEC. 3. TWIC APPLICATION REFORM. The Secretary of Homeland Security must streamline the process for TWIC enrollment, activation, issuance, and renewal to require only one in-person visit to an enrollment center, except in special circumstances."
