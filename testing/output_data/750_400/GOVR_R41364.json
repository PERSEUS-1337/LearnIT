Without action, rates would have reverted to pre-2003 levels. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for middle-income taxpayers. The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire in 2010, including lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for middle-income taxpayers. Tax rates were temporarily extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The tax rates for dividends and capital gains were extended through 2012 for middle-income taxpayers. In 2013, higher-income individuals were taxed at a higher rate, with thresholds set at $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The final resolution in 2013 was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals at a higher rate, with thresholds set at $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is strongly influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue in FY2019. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue in FY2019. The current effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses. Supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains have proposed measures to address potential behavioral responses, as high-income individuals derive a significant portion of their income from such gains. Some supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued, eliminating the realization response for affected assets. Look-back treatment could be applied to assets that are less easily valued to achieve the same after-tax earnings as accrual basis taxation. Some proponents suggest applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued, eliminating the realization response for affected assets. Look-back treatment may be used for assets that are harder to value to achieve similar after-tax earnings as accrual basis taxation. Tax was imposed on an accrual basis, leading to complexities in addressing behavioral responses. Realizations responses in revenue projections were publicly discussed in the late 1980s. This report analyzes the implications for revenue effects. The report discusses how realizations responses in revenue projections were publicly debated in the late 1980s and their implications for revenue effects. It suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. The report suggests that projections by the Obama Administration and the JCT may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire due to potential realizations responses. Taxpayers can choose to realize capital gains, impacting revenue from capital gains taxes. Postponing realizations until death can result in gains escaping tax entirely, creating an incentive to delay or avoid selling assets to avoid taxes. The potential revenue from capital gains taxes may be reduced due to realizations being postponed or avoided to escape taxes. Tax responses are typically negative elasticities, with realizations increasing when tax rates fall. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax changes is crucial for understanding revenue implications. Higher elasticity values indicate smaller revenue gains or losses from tax rate adjustments. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax changes determines the revenue impact. Higher elasticity values result in smaller revenue gains or losses from tax rate adjustments. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase generates revenue; if it is greater than one, the tax increase leads to revenue loss. The ratio of revenue gain projected to the gain realized with no behavioral response is one minus the elasticity. For example, if the elasticity is 0.25, 75% of the static revenue gain will be realized. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax changes determines the revenue impact. Higher elasticity values result in smaller revenue gains or losses from tax rate adjustments. Three types of elasticities are relevant to capital gains realizations and revenues, including the permanent elasticity. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax changes determines the revenue impact. Three types of elasticities are relevant: permanent, short-run, and transitory. Permanent elasticity is most relevant for permanent tax law changes, measuring the longer-run response to a tax rate change. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax changes is crucial for determining revenue impact. Three types of elasticities are relevant: permanent, short-run, and transitory. Permanent elasticity measures the longer-run response to a tax rate change, while short-run elasticity measures the short-term response. Transitory elasticity measures the response to temporary tax changes, which may occur due to varying incomes of wealthy individuals or pre-announced tax changes. The transitory effect of tax changes can occur due to varying incomes of wealthy individuals or pre-announced tax changes. This short-term impact poses challenges in estimation and affects shorter-term responses to tax changes. The discussion focuses on the short-term effects of tax changes, particularly on realizations elasticity. Taxpayers may shift realizations into the current year to take advantage of lower tax rates before an increase next year. This behavior poses challenges in estimation and affects shorter-term responses to tax changes. The short-term realizations elasticity is often discussed in the context of a capital gains tax cut. Taxpayers may have a large stock of accrued gains that they would realize if the tax rate were lower, leading to an increase in realizations in the first year or two. However, this short-term response may be muted if there has been a recent increase in realizations. The short-term response to a capital gains tax cut may be muted if there has been a recent increase in realizations, as seen in the late 1980s due to a pre-announced tax change. This suggests that a tax cut in 1990 would not have a significant short-run impact. The surge in realizations in 1986 was due to the pre-announced increase in capital gains taxes for 1987 and later years. A tax cut in 1990 would not have a large short-run response. An increase in taxes that is not pre-announced is not expected to have a short-term impact as it does not cause a contraction in unrealized gains. An increase in taxes that is not pre-announced is not expected to have a short-term impact as it does not cause a contraction in unrealized gains. The transitory response in 1986 occurred due to legislation that raised future tax rates. The transitory response, also known as a short-term response, occurs due to temporary changes in tax rates. Significant transitory responses occurred in 1986 and 2012 when tax rates were raised. Even without changes in tax laws, individuals with fluctuating income can experience transitory responses. The passage discusses the impact of legislation on tax rates, particularly on capital gains. It highlights the transitory responses that individuals may have to changes in tax laws, especially for higher-income taxpayers. Statistical estimates of realizations responses are based on various functional forms, with elasticity being a common factor. The possibility of a transitory response to changes in tax rates, especially for capital gains, was more pronounced before 1987 when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. Statistical estimates of realizations responses are based on different functional forms, with elasticity being a key factor that rises proportionally with the tax rate. Elasticities should be reported with reference to the assumed tax rate, such as the 22% rate discussed in the 1990 debate. The elasticity of capital gains realizations is expected to rise proportionally with the tax rate. Elasticities should be reported with reference to the assumed tax rate, such as the 22% rate discussed in the 1990 debate. The elasticities in this report will be stated and referred to in absolute value. This formulation also leads to a revenue-maximizing tax rate. The elasticities of capital gains realizations are expected to be negative, but will be stated in absolute value in this report. The revenue-maximizing tax rate is the rate at which the most capital gains tax revenue will be realized. The 22% rate is considered a starting point for tax increases. The revenue-maximizing tax rate for capital gains is estimated to be around 22%, with additional tax rates of 0%, 15%, and 20% currently in place. There is also a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office and the Department of the Treasury estimate the overall marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains to be around 21.2-21.3%. The 3.8% net investment income tax applies to high-income taxpayers with incomes above $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for singles. The overall marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains is estimated to be around 21.2-21.3%. Dividends are taxed at a slightly lower marginal rate of 18.4%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed a reduction in the capital gains tax rate. Treasury estimates a 21.3% rate for long-term capital gains taxes, while dividends are taxed at 18.4%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed reducing the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 28%. Revenue-estimating agencies began investigating behavioral responses to tax changes during the late 1980s. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed increasing the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. Revenue-estimating agencies investigated behavioral responses to tax changes, including realizations elasticities. The issue of revenue cost was crucial due to strict budget constraints at the time. The Administration and the Joint Committee on Taxation used different elasticities in their forecasts. The Congressional Budget Office and the Administration used different elasticities to forecast baseline capital gains revenues in 1990. Two types of data, aggregate time series, and micro-data studies, were used to estimate the realizations response to tax rate changes. The JTC used an elasticity of 0.76 to estimate the realizations response to tax rate changes. Two types of data were used: aggregate time series and micro-data studies. Estimates of the realizations response varied dramatically. Estimates of the realizations response to tax rate changes varied dramatically, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4. An elasticity of 0.3 would result in 70% of projected revenue with a small tax rate increase, while an elasticity of 4 would lead to a loss three times the projected revenue gain. Estimates of realizations response to tax rate changes varied from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue ranging from 70% to 10% of projected gains. Individual taxpayer data showed a range of 0.55 to 3.8, highlighting issues with estimation methods. Estimates of revenue gained without behavioral response ranged from 0.3 to 3.8, with implications for revenue varying from 70% to 10% of projected gains. The range of estimated responses highlighted issues with estimation methods, particularly for individual taxpayer data. The JCT favored time series results for more reliable estimates, while the Treasury's methodology remained unspecified. The JCT and Treasury used different methodologies to estimate revenue gains without behavioral response. The JCT favored time series results for reliability, while the Treasury's methodology was unspecified. Individual data is preferred for estimation to avoid bias and loss of information. Researchers faced challenges in estimating the realizations response, particularly in distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses. Individual data is preferred for estimation to avoid bias and loss of information, as well as difficulty in controlling for changing factors over time. Timing realizations to coincide with periods of low tax rates is a common strategy, especially for high-income individuals. Researchers encountered difficulties in estimating realizations response, specifically in distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses. Tax rates fluctuate over time, leading individuals to time realizations to align with low rates. This strategy is common among high-income individuals. The concern of relying on cross-section results for permanent responses led to the avoidance of larger elasticities from micro-data studies. Arguments were made for using panel data instead. Individuals may need to cash in assets during periods of low income and taxes. The use of panel data was suggested to differentiate between permanent and transitory responses to tax rate fluctuations. Studies using panel data reported smaller but still significant elasticities above one. Panel data studies were conducted to analyze individual tax rate elasticities over several years, showing smaller but still significant results above one. These findings influenced the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity compared to aggregate time series data. The panel studies showed tax rate elasticities above one, influencing the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity. However, the last panel study also had a very large elasticity, suggesting that transitory effects may not be fully corrected for. Panel studies attempted to address transitory effects by using a large elasticity, but this may not fully correct for the effects due to prolonged periods of income fluctuations. While panel studies offer some control over transitory effects, the available panels only cover a few years, leading to potential biases in estimates. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, although they were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. The range of realizations elasticities, even if confined to time series estimates, is very broad. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, but were eventually reduced in 1997 and 2003. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates after a spike in realizations in 1986. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates after a sharp spike in realizations in 1986, where gains increased significantly in December, seven times higher than the previous year, before falling in 1987. This event highlighted the impact of tax changes on capital gains taxes. In 1985 and 1986, realizations rose sharply to $324.4 billion before dropping to $144.2 billion in 1987. A study using taxpayer data revealed that these gains occurred in December, seven times higher than the previous year, coinciding with a tax increase for the following years. This increase raised concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. Additional academic studies on realizations response began in 1990, with nine reported in Table 1. In 1985 and 1986, realizations rose sharply to $324.4 billion before dropping to $144.2 billion in 1987. Concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies were raised. Eleven additional academic econometric studies of realizations response have been identified since 1990, with estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury reported in Table 1. The table in Table 1 includes estimates of practices by CBO, JCT, and Treasury for projecting capital gains realizations. CBO's estimate is part of a statistical study with various variables. The coefficient in the second column produces the elasticity when multiplied by the tax rate. Studies in the table are arranged by elasticity, with results from Gravelle's non-econometric study also included. The studies in Table 1 show estimates of capital gains realizations, arranged by elasticity. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to realizations response, stating that realizations cannot exceed accruals. Gravelle's study found a limit to the realizations response, with an upper limit of the realizations elasticity estimated to be 0.5, which is lower than other studies. The study found an upper limit of the realizations elasticity to be 0.5, lower than other studies, implying individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs. The upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, suggesting individuals would sell every asset every year in ideal conditions. However, in reality, the elasticity is likely lower due to various factors such as investor satisfaction and asset preferences. Table 1 presents the upper limit and midpoint of the study conducted in 1991. The study conducted in 1991 estimated the realizations to accruals level at 46% and the tax rate at 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows a similar ratio of 48% and a tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial study. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study in 1991 estimated realizations to accruals level at 46% and tax rate at 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 found a similar ratio of 48% and tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities. The study suggests that if all income and transaction taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase 4.25 times their current value, but accruals suggest they could only double. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study in 1991 estimated realizations to accruals level at 46% and tax rate at 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 found a similar ratio of 48% and tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities. The study suggests that if all income and transaction taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase 4.25 times their current value, but accruals suggest they could only double. The Gravelle study corrected the elasticity for the most recent panel study of the 1980s, indicating an elasticity of 3.2, similar to the cross-section results. This correction reinforced the observation that panel studies could not necessarily address the transitory issues that plagued cross-section studies. The Burman and Randolph study was an early innovative econometric study that used state tax rates to estimate the permanent elasticity. It found a small statistically insignificant elasticity and a large transitory elasticity exceeding 6. The Burman and Randolph study used state tax rates to estimate elasticities, finding a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity exceeding 6. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the study with similar results, falling below the upper limit of elasticities. The Burman and Randolph study found a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity exceeding 6. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the study with similar results, falling below the upper limit of elasticities. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, with some showing higher elasticities. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities among individual panel studies. They added state tax rates and had a longer panel, which likely affected their estimates. Their approach used adjacent years to capture permanent tax rates, but this period may be too short, leading to estimates reflecting transitory, timing responses. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study continued the approach of using adjacent years to capture permanent tax rates, but their estimates may reflect transitory timing responses. Their sensitivity analysis produced a wide range of estimates, with coefficients ranging from 1.8 to 8.0. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study provided sensitivity analysis with estimates ranging from 1.8 to 8.0, reflecting different specifications and time periods. Three studies, including CBO's estimate, used aggregate time series data. The Gillingham and Greenlees study added a few years of data to earlier studies. The coefficient ranged from 1.8 to 8.0 in different subperiods, with some studies questioning the higher estimate due to a large transitory elasticity of the wrong sign. Time series studies added more years of data, with results showing that adding more years led to lower elasticities. All time series results fell within the range of studies from the 1980s. The time series studies added more years of data, leading to lower elasticities. Results fell within the range of studies from the 1980s, with one study based on Australian data. State studies used aggregate data grouped by state. The third time series study, based on Australian data, falls below the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. State studies by Bogart and Gentry and Bakija and Gentry show results slightly above the upper limit, with Bakija and Gentry emphasizing the importance of controlling for state fixed effects. The Bakija and Gentry study analyzed data over time grouped by state, showing results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. They emphasized the importance of controlling for state fixed effects, which increased coefficients from 2.91 to 3.88. The elasticities in their study were lower and closer together compared to studies from the 1980s. The JCT's current coefficient was similar to the estimate used in the 1990 debate, with a slight difference due to the exclusion of small portfolio effects. The elasticities in Table 1 are lower and closer together than those in studies from the 1980s. Both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue to be gained. The Treasury estimate for raising the tax rate on capital gains has been reduced and is now similar to the JCT assumption. Both estimates appear high and likely underestimate the potential revenue increase. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for a five percentage point increase in the tax rate based on CBO projections. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019. The estimates are based on CBO's projections and show a range of revenue gains as a percentage of static gain, with adjustments made for short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates. The revenue gain from raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019 ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year, with adjustments made for short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates. Interest in adopting measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method is also highlighted. The static gain from a tax rate increase on capital gains ranges from 26% to 97%, with revenue gains ranging from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year. Interest in adopting accrual-based taxation with a look-back method is also highlighted, which could increase capital gains revenues and collect taxes on unrealized gains. Implementing a look-back method for calculating taxes on capital gains could significantly increase revenue, with estimates ranging from $10.3 billion to $43.2 billion. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable, despite potential elasticity effects from short panels in the 1980s. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study, despite potential elasticity effects from short panels in the 1980s, estimates $222 billion on unrealized gains in a steady state. The study may overstate the permanent elasticity and exceeds Gravelle's upper limit. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity, with dramatically differing estimates from different subperiods. The study by Eichner and Sinai includes more years than Gillingham and Greenlees, suggesting their time series result should be preferred. The elasticity estimates from different subperiods show fragility in the estimates. The findings of various studies and Gravelle's limit calculations suggest that the elasticity is likely overstated. The elasticity estimates from different subperiods show fragility in the estimates. Eichner and Sinai's study includes more years than Gillingham and Greenlees, suggesting their time series result should be preferred. CBO includes even more years. The findings suggest that revenue-estimating assumptions from the 1990 debate may understate the revenue gain. Evidence indicates that increasing the tax rate by five percentage points will result in revenue gains, although these gains are negligible. The elasticity estimates suggest revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points, with potential gains three times larger than projected by the JCT. Using the upper limit, revenues could be 45% larger than current projections. The elasticity estimates indicate potential revenue gains from a 5% tax rate increase, significantly higher than projected by the JCT. Using the upper limit could result in revenues 45% larger than current projections. This suggests that the JCT's revenue projections may underestimate the gains from raising capital gains tax rates. The appendix details the method of calculating taxes under the look-back method and modeling realizations and revenues based on the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes. The estimates suggest that raising capital gains tax rates could result in significantly higher revenue gains than currently projected. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function, resulting in an elasticity of bt. The relationship between gains (G) and tax rate (t) can be expressed as G = A e -bt, where A is a constant and b is the tax rate coefficient. The revenue equation can be written as R = tAe -bt. The revenue equation (R = tAe -bt) can be used to estimate revenues by dividing new values by old values. The revenue maximizing tax rate is where (1-bt) equals zero, which is equal to 1/b. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by where (1-bt) equals zero, which is equal to 1/b. If the coefficient of b is 2, the tax rate is 50%, and if b is 5, the tax rate is 20%. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by 1/b. For example, if b is 2, the tax rate is 50%, and if b is 5, the tax rate is 20%. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. Calculating taxes involves variables such as growth rate, holding period, sales price, basis, and tax rate. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by 1/b. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. Calculating taxes involves variables such as growth rate, holding period, sales price, basis, and tax rate. In these calculations, g = growth rate, T= holding period, S = sales price, B = basis, t = tax rate, and B* = new basis. To determine the growth rate g: g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. To find a value of B* that will give you the same return as accrual taxation: B* = [B(1+ ((S/B) 1/T -1)(1-t)) T -S(1-t)]/t. Elasticities in Studies of the 1980s are reported in Table B -1. The elasticities found in studies of the 1980s are reported in Table B-1, which influenced the choice of realizations response during the 1990 debate. Studies are categorized based on the approach used, with elasticities reported at a 22% tax rate. The formula for determining the new basis B* is provided as well. The 1980s studies influenced the realizations response during the 1990 debate, with elasticities reported at a 22% tax rate. The studies are categorized based on the approach used, and challenges in statistical analysis are discussed. Citations for all studies are in Appendix C. Statistical studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates face challenges, with debates over data types used. Aggregate time series results ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, as shown in Table B-1. When studying capital gains realizations and tax rates, the choice between aggregate time series data and individual taxpayer data is crucial. Aggregate time series results ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual taxpayer data varied from 0.55 to almost 4. It is generally more preferable to use individual data due to the loss of information with aggregate data. Estimates for capital gains realizations and tax rates ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 based on aggregate time series data and 0.55 to almost 4 for individual taxpayer data. Using individual data is preferred to avoid loss of information and potential biases from aggregated data. Changes in transactions costs and disconnects between asset prices and accruals could lead to overstated estimates. Loss of individual variability in aggregated data can bias results. Difficulty controlling for changes over time can lead to overstated estimates. Problems with individual data sets led researchers to believe aggregate time series results were more reliable. The problems with individual data sets led researchers to believe that aggregate time series results were more reliable, despite concerns about the accuracy of estimates and the potential for biases. The effective capital gains tax rate, a key variable in regression analysis, was found to be endogenous rather than exogenous, posing a serious econometric challenge that required different techniques to address. The effective capital gains tax rate is an endogenous variable, not exogenous as previously thought. Different techniques are needed to address this serious econometric problem, such as using first dollar tax rate, maximum statutory rates, predicted gains, or instrumental variables methods. The effective capital gains tax rate is an endogenous variable, requiring different techniques to address this serious econometric problem, such as using first dollar tax rate, maximum statutory rates, predicted gains, or instrumental variables methods. The issue of endogeneity is more severe in individual cross-section data due to individual circumstances, but less important in aggregate time series data where variation is mainly from changes in the law. The variation in the explanatory variable is more pronounced in individual cross-section data due to individual circumstances, while it is less significant in aggregate time series data where changes in the law are the main source of variation. The issue of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in individual data is also important, especially regarding income fluctuations and tax rate variations over time. Individuals may time realizations to coincide with low tax rates or need to cash in assets during periods of low income. Studies since the 1980s have attempted to address the issue of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in individual data regarding income fluctuations and tax rate variations over time. Previous attempts to create a permanent tax rate using panel studies may not fully correct for the transitory effect, as periods of lower income can persist for several years. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in income fluctuations and tax rate variations. Attempts to create a permanent tax rate using panel studies may not fully correct for the transitory effect, as periods of lower income can persist for several years. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) is one of the studies discussed in this context. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in income fluctuations and tax rate variations. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies and found varying, but quite large, elasticities. Their study confirms potential problems with previous studies and suggests short panels have significant implications. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies on income fluctuations and tax rate variations. They found large elasticities, confirming issues with previous studies and highlighting problems with short panels. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in their six-year small panel study, similar to previous studies from the 1980s. However, the results were statistically insignificant and varied over time periods, suggesting potential transitory effects. This methodology has largely been rejected, leading to the exclusion of their results. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in their six-year small panel study, but the results were statistically insignificant and varied over time periods, suggesting potential transitory effects. Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a previous time series analysis and made changes in approaches used by CBO to replicate results, excluding them from further analysis. This study extends a previous time series analysis from 1954-1985 to 1989, making changes in approaches used by CBO. The authors used an instrumental variables technique to increase the coefficient from 2.9 to 4.2 and the elasticity at a 22% tax rate. The authors proposed using different instrumental variables techniques to increase the coefficient and elasticity of tax rates. They suggested using taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate as instruments, as well as differencing the data for higher elasticities. The authors recommended using different instrumental variables techniques to enhance the coefficient and elasticity of tax rates. They proposed using the maximum tax rate as an instrument, which increased the coefficient to 5.8 and the elasticity to 1.28. Differencing the data also resulted in higher elasticities, but these were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989, with or without excluding 1986, yielded varying results. The authors recommended using different instrumental variables techniques to enhance the coefficient and elasticity of tax rates. They proposed using the maximum tax rate as an instrument, which increased the coefficient to 5.8 and the elasticity to 1.28. Differencing the data also resulted in higher elasticities, but these were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989, with or without excluding 1986, yielded varying results. The elasticities for the instruments with predicted gains and the maximum rate were not statistically significant at conventional levels. Excluding 1986 showed different estimates for the elasticities, with values ranging from 3.4 to 5.4. The study compared elasticities of tax rates using different instrumental variables techniques. Excluding 1986, estimates ranged from 3.4 to 5.4, with varying results for predicted gains and maximum tax rates as instruments. The authors concluded that micro-data approaches are superior, but the choice between instruments remains unclear. The study compared tax rate elasticities using different instrumental variables techniques. The choice between using predicted gains rate or maximum rate as an instrument remains unclear due to changes in the law over time. The maximum rate used as an instrument in time-series regression poses problems due to substantial changes in the law over the period, affecting the relationship between maximum rate and average rate. Despite reservations, a coefficient of 3.4 is reported in Table 1 from the Burman and Randolph study, which innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects in a short panel from 1979-1983 using state tax variations. The Burman and Randolph study from 1979-1983 separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax variations. The coefficient of 3.4 is reported in Table 1, despite reservations about using the maximum rate as an instrument in time-series regression. The authors studied the effects of state tax rate variations from 1979-1983, separating permanent and transitory effects. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, but the results were not statistically significant. The authors studied state tax rate variations from 1979-1983, estimating an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate. The results were not statistically significant due to limited tax rate variation. Subsequent studies also used state tax rates in their analysis. The study by Bogart and Gentry (1995) used state tax rate differentials from 1979 to 1990 to identify permanent responses, reporting an elasticity of 0.65. The analysis controlled for fixed-year effects using year dummies, with the main identification based on tax rate differentials across states. The study by Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated results from Burman and Randolph using panel data from 1985 to 1994, reporting an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate. The techniques used should identify a permanent elasticity. The study by Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated Burman and Randolph's results using panel data from 1985 to 1994. They found an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, with a coefficient suggesting an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% tax rate. A transitory elasticity of 4.9 was also reported. Based on evidence from Eichner and Sinai, the tax rate is estimated to be around 25%. Auerbach and Siegel also found a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to the transitory elasticity of 4.9. The study by Auerbach and Siegel presents an alternative specification with additional instruments to the permanent tax rate regression, resulting in a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75. The inclusion of the current first dollar tax rate introduces a transitory element, leading to a significantly larger elasticity. The study by Auerbach and Siegel introduces a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 by adding the current first dollar tax rate, which may result in a transitory element. They also provide separate regressions for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers, showing essentially no response for these groups. Eichner and Sinai's study extends time series analysis through 1997. The study by Eichner and Sinai (2000) extends time series analysis through 1997, excluding 1986 and possibly 1997 from the estimates. The coefficient is 2.18 when both years are excluded, with an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. There is essentially no response for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers in their separate regressions. The study by Eichner and Sinai (2000) extends time series analysis through 1997, finding a coefficient of 2.18 and an elasticity of 0.48 when excluding 1986 and possibly 1997. Different specifications and methods lead to varying estimates, with the coefficient ranging from 2.28 to 5.13 and elasticities from 0.5 to 1.13. The study by Eichner and Sinai (2000) explores different specifications and methods to estimate the elasticity of tax rates. Using an instrumental variables method, they found an elasticity of 0.84 when relying on the top marginal tax rate. Excluding 1997 led to a higher estimate of 1.13. The authors also considered changes in tax rates, resulting in elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. The authors explored different methods to estimate tax rate elasticity, finding values ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. However, most coefficients were not statistically significant. Due to issues with using marginal rates and instability with tax rate changes, a coefficient of 2.28 is reported in Table 1. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects, with a coefficient of 2.28 reported in Table 1. They do not use state tax variation to identify permanent effects, similar to panel studies from the 1980s. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects. Their estimate is lower than most estimates from the 1980s, with an elasticity of 0.72 at an apparent 20% tax rate. The study by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, with an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate. Evans (2009) also conducted a study with elasticities typically between 2 and 5. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression study with elasticities typically between 2 and 5, indicating a coefficient of 3.6 and an elasticity of 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. The study highlights issues with public use file data and the limitations of cross-section studies in reflecting permanent realizations of elasticities. The study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) uses a 50-year panel of state data on tax rates, with state- and time-fixed effects. The identification for the effects comes from changes in effective state marginal tax rates, which are largely exogenous. Bakija and Gentry (2014) study uses a 50-year panel of state data on tax rates with state- and time-fixed effects. The identification for the effects comes from changes in effective state marginal tax rates, which are largely exogenous. The authors provide tests of changing specifications, showing significant effects in raising elasticities when omitting state-fixed and year-fixed effects. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) study uses standard panel methods. The authors in Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) study use standard panel methods with a 10-year panel. Their estimates of transitory elasticities rely on adjacent years, but they include year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes. The study in Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) uses Australian data from 1988 to 2015, including controls similar to those in the U.S. It covers a period with exclusions for capital gains and changes in marginal tax rates, providing sensitivity analysis with different specifications and time subperiods.
