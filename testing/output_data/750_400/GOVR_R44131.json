Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. This report outlines the history of UCLASS requirements development in response to Congressional requests. The U.S. Navy's UCLASS aircraft has faced controversy and delays in determining its roles and requirements. Members of Congress have proposed actions to resolve the requirements issue and allow the program to move ahead. This report details the history of UCLASS requirements development in response to a specific Congressional request. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA began research on an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), while the Air Force and DARPA worked on a separate UCAV project. The Navy's UCAV was designed for reconnaissance missions and to fit a specific niche, with plans to continue using manned aircraft for other purposes. The Navy's UCAV project, known as N-UCAV, focused on reconnaissance missions and identifying targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman independently built the X-47A air vehicle for testing under this program, with its first flight in February 2003. The N-UCAV program, focused on reconnaissance missions and identifying targets for manned aircraft, led to the development of the X-47A air vehicle by Northrop Grumman. In 2003, the Defense Department directed the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program for increased synergy. In February 2003, the Office of the Secretary of Defense directed the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program called Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) to demonstrate the feasibility and value of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program, initiated in 2003, aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility and military utility of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions in denied enemy territories. The J-UCAS program aimed to demonstrate the military utility of weaponized unmanned air vehicles for missions in denied enemy territories. The system focused on combat situations requiring survivable, persisting presence in denied airspace. The program was terminated in 2006, leading to the development of a new bomber for the Air Force and a longer-range carrier-based unmanned aircraft for the Navy. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review called for the termination of the J-UCAS program, leading to the development of a new bomber for the Air Force and the Navy's mandate to develop the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) for greater standoff capability and naval reach. The Navy initiated the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program in 2006 as part of the N-UCAS program to demonstrate the technical feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program to demonstrate unmanned air combat systems' feasibility on aircraft carriers. In 2013, they successfully launched and landed a UCAS-D on an aircraft carrier, leading to approval for the UCLASS acquisition program in 2011. The Navy invested $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program, successfully launching and landing it on an aircraft carrier in 2013. This led to approval for the UCLASS acquisition program in 2011, aiming to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance. The UCLASS acquisition program, derived from the UCAS-D program, aimed to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance. Approved in 2011, UCLASS was designed to enhance the Navy's ability to operate in highly contested environments. The UCLASS program was approved in 2011 to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance the Navy's ability to operate in highly contested environments. The JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement in 2012, significantly altering the project's requirements. The JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement in 2012, altering the project's requirements to heavily favor permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. The Navy's next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle's strike capability was reduced due to budget constraints, favoring permissive airspace ISR capabilities. JROCMs 086-12 and 196-12 redefined the scope of JROCM 087-11 to support missions from counter-terrorism to low-end contested operations. The Pentagon's director of unmanned warfare and ISR stated that JROCMs 086-12 and 196-12 redefined the scope of JROCM 087-11 to support various missions, emphasizing affordability as a top priority. The CDD established an affordability KPP for the program. The JROC emphasized affordability as the top priority for the program in a December 2012 memorandum. The CDD established an affordability KPP with a limit of $150 million for the recurring fly-away cost of air vehicles. Limited funding for system development is pressuring industry to provide mature systems and focus on cost during development. The Navy established an affordability KPP with a $150 million limit for the recurring fly-away cost of air vehicles to conduct one 600 nautical mile orbit. Limited funding for system development is pressuring industry to provide mature systems and focus on cost. The draft RFP for the UCLASS system emphasized affordability, timely fielding, and endurance, while de-emphasizing the need to operate in highly contested environments. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) for the UCLASS system on April 17, 2014, emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The program aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability for eliminating targets of opportunity. The UCLASS program aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability for eliminating targets of opportunity. The system design will allow for capability growth to operate in contested environments. The UCLASS program aims to provide an early operational capability for light strike in permissive environments, with the potential for growth to operate in contested environments. The end goal is an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in contested environments, expanding its missions to include extended range intelligence and surveillance. The UCLASS program aims to provide an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in contested environments, with missions including intelligence, surveillance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. The timeline for procurement is unclear, and ongoing delays have been noted due to changes in requirements. The procurement timeline for UCLASS is uncertain, with ongoing delays due to changes in requirements. The Navy's schedule for UCLASS has been delayed as the system's mission and capabilities are being questioned. DOD is conducting a review of its airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing, resulting in adjustments to the program's schedule. The award of the air system contract is now expected in fiscal year 2016. The Navy's UCLASS schedule has been delayed due to questions about its mission and capabilities. DOD is reviewing its airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing, leading to adjustments in the program's schedule. The air system contract award is now expected in fiscal year 2017, with early operational capability not expected until fiscal year 2022. The Navy's UCLASS program schedule has been delayed, with the air system contract now expected in fiscal year 2017, a 3-year delay. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a 2-year delay. Further reviews and changes in DOD priorities may lead to evolving requirements."
