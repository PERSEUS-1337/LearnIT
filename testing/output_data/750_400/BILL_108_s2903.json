    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are vital for youth development, promoting leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Nonprofit organizations prioritize the well-being of young people through enacting rules, despite the risk of injuries. Amateur athletics are crucial for the health and well-being of American society, with nonprofit organizations prioritizing young people's best interests. Injuries are a risk but should not overshadow the benefits of sports participation, such as lower obesity levels in youth. Participating in amateur athletics offers numerous benefits, including lower obesity levels and improved fitness in youth. Sports involvement also leads to healthier adulthood and fewer health issues as individuals age. Rules in amateur sports ensure appropriate competition for young athletes, promoting physical activity and overall well-being. Young people benefit from participating in sports through improved fitness and reduced health problems as they age. Rules in amateur sports are essential for providing appropriate competition for youth, involving intense physical activity with inherent risks that require clear boundaries to prevent injuries. Rules makers in amateur sports face increasing lawsuits alleging negligence in rule development. Athletes accept inherent risks in sports, and allowing lawsuits based on rule-making is deemed unfair. Lawsuits against rules makers in amateur sports for negligence in rule development can have a detrimental impact on their ability to provide services and discourage top coaches, officials, and administrators from serving on rules committees.
