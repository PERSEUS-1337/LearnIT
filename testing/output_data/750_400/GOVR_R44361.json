The agreement was concluded in late 2015, signed in February 2016, and aims to liberalize trade among 12 member countries with implications for U.S. relations in the region. Congress played an active role in the TPP negotiations through oversight and consultations with the Administration. The TPP agreement was signed in February 2016 with the aim to liberalize trade among 12 member countries, including the U.S. Congress had an active role in the negotiations and would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to take effect. The potential impacts of the TPP may be a topic of debate in Congress during the second session of the 114th Congress. The TPP agreement was signed in February 2016 with the aim to liberalize trade among 12 member countries, including the U.S. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to take effect. The potential impacts of the agreement may be a topic of debate in Congress during the second session of the 114th Congress. According to TPP proponents, the agreement's significance is not just economic but also strategic, encompassing both geo-political and geo-economic aspects of U.S. policy. The TPP agreement, signed in February 2016, aims to liberalize trade among 12 member countries, including the U.S. Proponents, like U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, argue that the TPP's significance is not just economic but also strategic. This strategic importance involves using the agreement to exert influence in the region and beyond, in economic, political, and security spheres. Through the TPP, the United States can create conditions that facilitate other policy tools. The TPP's strategic importance lies in the United States using the agreement to exert influence in economic, political, and security spheres, strengthen alliances, maintain leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, drive economic growth, and establish regional trade rules. The TPP aims to strengthen regional alliances, maintain U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, drive economic growth, and establish trade rules consistent with U.S. interests. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are key factors in analyzing U.S. influence. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are key factors in analyzing U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region. China, not a TPP member, plays a significant role in regional trade and investment initiatives. China's rapid economic growth has positioned it as a major trade partner in Asia, leading to concerns about its regional influence. Some analysts believe China's trade and investment initiatives aim to reduce U.S. power in the region. The TPP is seen as a way for the U.S. to maintain leadership in Asia and establish trade norms in response to China's actions. China is using regional initiatives to minimize U.S. presence and power, while the TPP is seen as a way for the U.S. to maintain leadership in Asia and establish trade norms in response to China's actions. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to China could create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions in the region. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to China could create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions in the region. U.S. and Chinese goals for trade liberalization may be mutually reinforcing rather than competing, creating tension in balancing policy priorities for policymakers. Trade agreements like the TPP exist at the intersection of domestic and foreign policy, with economic and political elements. Policymakers face tension in balancing various priorities, as some argue that focusing on the strategic aspects of the TPP distracts from its potential impact on the U.S. economy. Critics and supporters of the TPP cite different economic outcomes to support their positions, but strategic implications are also important. The TPP agreement's strategic elements are debated by critics and supporters, with a focus on its potential impact on the U.S. economy. Proponents highlight broader strategic implications that are challenging to quantify. This report examines strategic arguments from the Administration, TPP proponents, and opponents in the Asia-Pacific region. The report examines strategic arguments presented by the Administration, TPP proponents, and opponents in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on implications for Asia and potential future legislation. The report focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, emphasizing implications for Asia and strategic issues for Congress to consider regarding the TPP agreement. The United States has a history of advancing trade agreements like FTAs to promote foreign policy goals, with the first FTA signed with Israel in 1985. Observers argue that FTAs with Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman in the 2000s were based on economic, security, and foreign policy considerations. The United States has a history of using trade agreements like FTAs to advance foreign policy goals. FTAs with countries like Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman were not just economically motivated but also aimed at enhancing security and foreign policy objectives. The first U.S. FTA in Asia was with Singapore in 2004, emphasizing strategic interests in liberalizing trade. Obama Administration officials and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade policy initiatives are crucial for promoting international cooperation. The first U.S. FTA in Asia with Singapore in 2004 emphasized strategic interests in liberalizing trade and enhancing security and foreign policy objectives, particularly in combating terrorism. The Obama Administration and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade policy initiatives in Asia, such as the TPP, have significant geostrategic importance in shaping the global economic order to reflect U.S. interests and values. The Obama Administration and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade policy initiatives in Asia, particularly the TPP, have considerable geostrategic importance in shaping the global economic order to reflect U.S. interests and values. The Administration's 2015 National Security Strategy emphasizes the need to use economic strength strategically to set new rules of the road and promote inclusive development, with TPP seen as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. The TPP is a key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region and a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. If not approved by Congress, the U.S. could be seen as weak in its leadership role in Asia. The TPP is the Obama Administration's economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region. Failure to approve it could weaken U.S. leadership in Asia. Administration officials argue it signals active integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. Officials argue that the TPP is crucial for the United States to be integrated into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. Many in the Asia-Pacific region, including TPP negotiating partners, support this view. The TPP is seen as crucial for the US to be integrated into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, with many in the region supporting this view. Singapore's Prime Minister emphasized the strategic significance of the agreement, stating that failing to conclude the TPP would damage the US's credibility worldwide. The TPP is important for the US to be integrated into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. Failing to conclude the agreement will hurt the US's credibility worldwide. Some argue that the TPP is crucial for developing and strengthening regional institutions to foster cooperation and peaceful resolution of differences. The TPP is part of a broader U.S. strategy to develop regional institutions that promote cooperation and peaceful resolution of differences through respect for rules and norms. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon emphasized the importance of U.S. economic diplomacy in advancing global prosperity by strengthening international rules and norms. Linkages between the TPP and broader diplomatic and security interests are key arguments for the agreement. The TPP is seen as a way to advance global prosperity and strengthen international rules and norms. Proponents argue that it will reinforce U.S. alliances and partnerships in East Asia, with some likening its importance to that of another aircraft carrier for national security. However, not all supporters of the agreement explicitly link it to security rationales. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of passing TPP, equating it to another aircraft carrier. Proponents believe the agreement will strengthen U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics argue that security partnerships depend more on countries' security interests than trade agreements. Many backers of the agreement do not specify how it would enhance U.S. security partnerships in the region. Critics argue that bilateral political and security relationships are influenced more by countries' security interests than by trade agreements. For example, they question the impact of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement on fundamental interests in Northeast Asia. The South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are not seen as key factors in determining the strength of security alliances in Northeast Asia. Critics argue that bilateral security relationships are more influenced by countries' security interests than by trade agreements. The strength of security alliances in Northeast Asia is determined by countries' perception of threats from China or North Korea, rather than trade agreements like KORUS FTA or TPP. Japan's strategic decisions drive its cooperation with the United States, while TPP may have a greater impact on countries with less close relationships with the U.S., such as Vietnam. In recent years, Japan's strategic decisions have driven its deepening cooperation with the United States. The TPP may have a larger impact on countries like Vietnam, where a successful outcome could support reform-oriented decision-makers and lead to deeper market-oriented changes required by TPP provisions. Many Vietnamese leaders would view TPP approval as a positive sign of closer relations with the United States. TPP negotiations in Vietnam could support reform-oriented decision-makers by requiring deeper market-oriented institutional changes. Approval of the agreement may signal closer ties with the United States, while failure to approve could impact Vietnam's perception of the US as a reliable partner. Some argue that the TPP will benefit the US, as Defense Secretary Carter has stated. Approval of the TPP by Vietnam is seen as a positive signal of closer ties with the United States. Some argue that failure to approve the agreement could impact Vietnam's perception of the US as a reliable partner. Proponents believe the TPP will help promote a global order reflecting US interests and values, particularly in the economic realm. The link between the TPP's trade rules and security is less clear but historically, the US has aimed for a rules-based trading system based on transparency, openness, and non-discrimination. The TPP's trade rules may indirectly impact U.S. security relationships by influencing countries' strategic interests. Each major agreement signals key partnerships, potentially altering perceptions of strategic alliances. Implementing the TPP could strengthen the United States' presence in the Pacific region and signal to other countries that the Pacific Rim is a priority for the U.S., potentially impacting security relationships. Implementing the TPP could help \"lock-in\" the United States' Pacific presence, signaling to other countries the region's importance to U.S. policymakers. Failure to approve the TPP may be seen as a sign of declining U.S. interest and leadership in the region. Many Asian policymakers fear that a failure of the TPP in the United States could signal a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in the region, potentially creating an influence vacuum for China to fill. U.S. credibility in Asia is currently in question amidst China's rise. Many argue that U.S. credibility in Asia is in question, with China's rise and North Korea's growing capabilities challenging U.S. influence. Some believe a failed TPP would create an influence vacuum for China to fill, leading to strained relationships and loss of trust. The rejection of a TPP agreement by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation, impacting relationships like that between the United States and Japan. Proponents argue that the TPP is crucial for U.S. influence in shaping regional and global trade and investment efforts. The rejection of a TPP agreement by Congress could result in a loss of trust and cooperation, impacting relationships and U.S. influence on regional and global trade efforts. Proponents argue that the rules established in the TPP will promote economic growth and advance U.S. interests by influencing trade regimes, encouraging market opening and economic reforms among current members, creating incentives for other Asia-Pacific nations to follow suit, addressing new trade barriers, and updating critical gaps. The TPP aims to promote economic growth by influencing trade regimes, encouraging market opening, and addressing new trade barriers. The U.S. seeks to update the rules-based trading system through the TPP. The United States aims to update the rules-based trading system through the TPP by addressing critical gaps in existing trade rules and expanding economic engagement through trade. This goal builds on the country's history of leading trade liberalization negotiations and establishing international trade norms. The United States has a history of leading trade liberalization negotiations and establishing international trade norms. The current WTO multilateral trade negotiations, the WTO Doha Development Agenda, have largely stalled due to persistent differences among its members. Global commerce has adapted to rapid advances in technology. The current WTO multilateral trade negotiations, known as the WTO Doha Development Agenda, have stalled due to differences among members. Global commerce has evolved with technology, leading to gaps in current trade rules regarding digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Countries like the United States are pursuing new trade agreements to address these issues. Advances in technology have highlighted gaps in current multilateral trade rules, particularly in areas like digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Countries, including the United States, are seeking new trade agreements like the TPP to address these issues. The TPP's economic significance is emphasized by creating a significant bloc of nations with broad disciplines, accounting for a large portion of global GDP. The TPP is a significant trade agreement involving 12 economies, accounting for 37% of global GDP. It allows for new countries to join and could provide cover for domestic reform agendas in emerging economies. The TPP's economic significance could grow as new countries can join, providing cover for domestic reform agendas in emerging economies. This could also promote U.S. goals such as worker rights and environmental protection. The TPP could lead to greater access to the U.S. market, promote worker rights, protect the environment, and create competitive pressure for other countries to join, driving further trade liberalization in the region. Japan's involvement in the TPP negotiations was partly in response to the completion of the U.S. FTA. The TPP agreement may prompt other countries to join to avoid competitive disadvantages, potentially expanding trade and investment liberalization in the region. However, some note that key Asian economies like China, India, and Indonesia are not part of the agreement, limiting its comprehensive impact on trade and investment rules. Some experts believe that the TPP may not create a comprehensive set of trade rules in the Asia-Pacific as it excludes key economies like China, India, and Indonesia. However, there is potential for other large Asian countries to join in the future, expanding trade and investment liberalization in the region. Several large Asian countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, have expressed interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members once the agreement is implemented, potentially expanding its influence in the region. Taiwan has also shown interest in membership, but many Asian nations face domestic opposition to joining TPP. Once implemented, the TPP agreement may see an expansion of its influence, with countries like Taiwan expressing interest in membership. Some Asian nations, however, face domestic opposition to joining. Analysts suggest that countries like South Korea and Colombia could be likely candidates for TPP entry. Proponents argue that mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could have significant economic implications. Proponents argue that U.S. FTA partners in Asia and Latin America, such as South Korea and Colombia, may seek entry into the TPP soon. They believe mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could influence multilateral negotiations and set new trade rules beyond WTO commitments. Critics, however, raise concerns about these bilateral agreements. The TPP and T-TIP agreements could impact multilateral negotiations and set new trade rules beyond WTO commitments. Critics worry that these bilateral agreements may divert attention from multilateral initiatives and undermine the legitimacy of the WTO. Critics argue that bilateral and regional trade negotiations may divert resources from multilateral initiatives, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the WTO and hindering future trade liberalization efforts. Mega-regionals could complicate the trading system by introducing conflicting rules instead of adhering to established multilateral standards. The WTO's role in future trade liberalization could be affected by mega-regionals creating overlapping rules. TPP negotiations are ongoing in the Asia-Pacific region, while the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a significant negotiation outside the TPP. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a significant trade negotiation in the Asia-Pacific region, involving 10 ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The United States is not part of RCEP negotiations and has not shown interest in joining. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) aims to create a collective Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between 10 ASEAN members and six other nations. The United States is not involved in RCEP negotiations. A comparison with existing ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) suggests potential differences in trade liberalization levels. A comparison of ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP indicates potential differences in trade liberalization levels for the RCEP. The TPP includes more extensive provisions on intellectual property rights, investment, labor, environmental standards, and disciplines on state-owned enterprises, which may not be addressed in RCEP. This has led some to view RCEP as an alternative trade agreement. The TPP includes more extensive provisions on intellectual property rights, investment, labor, and environmental standards compared to existing ASEAN FTAs. Some argue that RCEP presents an alternative to the TPP, while others believe both agreements can be complementary for economic growth in the region. Seven countries are in both RCEP and the TPP, indicating a potential for compatibility and synergy between the two agreements. The RCEP and TPP agreements may present challenges or be complementary for economic growth in the region. Seven countries are part of both agreements, suggesting potential compatibility. The timing and impact of these regional undertakings on existing trade architecture remain uncertain. The RCEP and TPP agreements may have some compatibility and synergy. It is unclear how they will affect each other and the existing trade architecture in the region, depending on their timing. The TPP negotiations are more advanced than RCEP, but a delay in TPP ratification could change the sequencing. All 12 TPP countries and 11 RCEP countries are also part of the APEC forum for dialogue and nonbinding commitments. The TPP negotiations are more advanced than RCEP, with a possible delay in ratification altering the sequencing. Both TPP and RCEP countries are part of the APEC forum, which has discussed the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific since 2006. APEC members have discussed creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) since 2006, with China and the United States supporting this goal. In 2014, APEC leaders recognized TPP and RCEP as potential pathways to FTAAP. China's role in TPP debates and U.S. policy in Asia is significant due to its economic size and trading power. China's inclusion in the TPP and RCEP is seen as a possible pathway to the FTAAP. The debate over China's role in the TPP is significant due to its economic size and trading power. Some argue that China is trying to minimize U.S. influence in the region, making the completion of the TPP strategically important. The TPP proponents argue that China's growing international influence increases the strategic importance of completing the proposed TPP. Analysts suggest that China is trying to create a regional order to minimize U.S. presence and power, making the TPP necessary to counter this effort. China's trade and investment initiatives in the region have created a different vision of economic development, potentially not in the U.S. interest. The TPP is seen as a way for the United States to shape regional economic development in line with its interests, countering China's influence in the region. The agreement's size and economic importance are believed to influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions. The proposed TPP aims to shape regional economic development in line with U.S. interests, potentially countering China's influence. Its size and economic importance could influence China's decisions favorably towards U.S. economic, diplomatic, and security interests. President Obama highlighted the importance of enforceable labor and environmental standards, IP protections, and non-discrimination in the agreement. The TPP could shape regional economic development in line with U.S. interests, potentially influencing China to consider international norms. It may also push China to further liberalize its economic and trade regime to eventually join the agreement. The completion of the TPP could prompt China to adhere to international norms, potentially leading to further economic liberalization and trade reforms. This could provide political cover for reformers in China to push for deeper changes beyond their WTO commitments. However, some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may overstate its influence on trade and investment rules. Some argue that completing the TPP could prompt China to adhere to international norms, potentially leading to further economic liberalization. This could give reformers in China political cover to push for deeper changes. However, others believe portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may overstate its influence on trade and investment rules. Arguments against the TPP highlight concerns about China's potential negative reactions, the perception of the U.S. as obstructionist in Asia, and the impact on regional development commitments. China's leaders are focused on developing their nation into a prosperous major power, which they believe is crucial for their goals. Other Asian nations are unlikely to adopt trade policies that do not align with their interests, regardless of whether they are American, Chinese, or otherwise. The United States risks being seen as obstructionist in Asia if it opposes regional development initiatives, potentially leading to doubts about its commitments in the region. China's leaders are focused on developing their nation into a prosperous major power, with goals predicated on a strong economy, defense, and global role. The Chinese government is pursuing policies to strengthen the economy and increase China's global economic influence through initiatives like the Silk Road Economic Belt. The Chinese government is pursuing policies to strengthen its economy and increase its global economic influence through initiatives like the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road. This includes the creation of new financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). China is implementing the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative to enhance trade and economic development by creating new linkages to various regions. New financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road Fund are providing capital for major projects. China aims to increase the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, to simplify transactions and support assistance programs. China's efforts to increase the overseas use of the renminbi through institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund aim to support the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative and other economic projects. This strategy also reduces commercial risks for Chinese companies in international trade and enhances China's global economic influence. Additionally, Chinese leaders view the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as a stepping stone towards a broader Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), which could establish regional rules influenced by Chinese leadership. China's leaders aim to enhance China's global economic stature by promoting reforms in multilateral institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. The establishment of the AIIB reflects China's efforts to offer assistance programs and reduce commercial risks for Chinese companies engaged in international trade and investment. Additionally, Chinese leaders see the RCEP as a foundation for a broader FTAAP, influenced by Chinese leadership. China's leaders are actively promoting reforms in multilateral institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. The establishment of the AIIB is part of China's efforts to offer an alternative model for multilateral development banks. It is unclear whether the AIIB will be distinct from or in line with existing international institutions. China is reshaping or creating new economic institutions. The AIIB is China's attempt to provide an alternative model for multilateral development banks like the ADB. It is unclear if the AIIB will be distinct from existing institutions. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are part of its broader strategy to reduce U.S. influence in diplomatic and security spheres. China's actions in the diplomatic and security spheres aim to counter U.S. influence by reshaping economic institutions and creating a new Asian continental security system. China's extensive reclamation and construction in the South China Sea are seen as efforts to counter U.S. naval power in the Western Pacific. China aims to counter U.S. influence by reshaping economic institutions and creating a new Asian continental security system. Its actions in the South China Sea are viewed as efforts to challenge U.S. naval power in the Western Pacific. China's stance on the TPP has evolved over time, with initial portrayals of it as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. China's views on the TPP have changed over time, initially seen as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. However, President Obama clarified that the TPP was not meant to contain or disadvantage China, expressing hope for China to join in some capacity. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process softened after Japan joined the talks in 2013. China's Vice Finance Minister stated that a TPP agreement was incomplete without China's involvement. President Obama clarified that the TPP was not aimed at isolating or containing China, expressing hope for China to adopt fairness in operations. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process softened after Japan joined the talks in 2013. China's Vice Finance Minister stated that a TPP agreement was incomplete without China's involvement. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP, stating that various FTA arrangements can foster a just and free international trade order. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP. China's Vice Finance Minister stated that a TPP agreement was \"incomplete without China.\" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP, stating that various FTA arrangements can foster a just and free international trade order. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP, although Chinese officials have concerns about implementing the proposed standards. President Obama mentioned China's interest in participating in the TPP in the future. President Obama mentioned China's interest in joining the TPP in June 2015, with analysts suggesting that the US aims to integrate China more fully into trade liberalization and establish new trade rules. China has expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP, but officials have concerns about implementing the proposed standards. The United States aims to integrate China into deeper trade commitments and establish new rules to address issues not covered by the WTO. Negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty with China are ongoing to boost investment flows. The United States is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially involve China in the TPP. Congress has been directly involved in guiding and overseeing the TPP negotiations since the US joined in 2008. The United States has been involved in guiding and overseeing the TPP negotiations since joining in 2008. Congress approved legislation in 2015 to renew Trade Promotion Authority for U.S. trade negotiating objectives. Congress will play a direct role in considering TPP and its implementation. Key issues for Congress to consider include whether TPP aligns with broader foreign policy strategy. The TPP agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, with implications beyond trade. Congress will have a direct role in considering and implementing the agreement. The TPP agreement is seen as part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, with implications beyond trade. Proponents argue that it could reinforce U.S. leadership in the region and encourage nations to adopt a more U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook. The TPP agreement aims to promote international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging nations to adopt a more U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook. Congress should consider the strategic implications and trade-offs of accepting the rules and disciplines of the TPP. Congress may need to weigh the strategic arguments and trade-offs of accepting the TPP agreement as part of a broader foreign policy strategy. The potential strategic benefits of the agreement may depend on its ability to drive economic growth and prosperity. The TPP's strategic implications and potential benefits are key considerations for Congress. The agreement's impact on the U.S. economy and its role in U.S. leadership in Asia are important factors to weigh. Membership expansion and the broader group involved will also influence the agreement's strategic impact. The TPP's strategic implications and potential benefits are key considerations for Congress. Membership expansion and the broader group involved will influence the agreement's strategic impact. The TPP is seen as an important measure of U.S. leadership in Asia, but concerns arise from individual terms of the agreement. The proposed TPP, established by like-minded countries, offers the United States the best opportunity to pursue trade policy goals not achievable in the WTO. The agreement's strategic impact hinges on broader membership and striking a balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. Failed ratification could hinder U.S. leadership in the region. The TPP agreement aims to balance trade liberalization with U.S. economic interests and attract a broader set of regional actors. Failure to ratify could setback U.S. leadership in the region and delay the formation of an alternative agreement. The TPP agreement aims to balance trade liberalization with U.S. economic interests and attract a broader set of regional actors. Congress may need to consider the impact of delays or failure to ratify the agreement on U.S. leadership in the region. Rejection of the TPP could lead to a significant setback and potentially take years for an alternative agreement to form. Other countries in the region are pursuing their own trade arrangements, raising questions about the impact on foreign governments' views on U.S. leadership and credibility. The TPP agreement aims to balance trade liberalization with U.S. economic interests and attract a broader set of regional actors. Congress may need to consider the impact of delays or failure to ratify the agreement on U.S. leadership in the region. Other countries in the region continue to pursue their own trade arrangements, potentially impacting foreign governments' views on U.S. leadership and credibility. Some observers suggest the U.S. should reinforce economic engagement beyond the current TPP membership to prevent the perception of neglecting important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Some observers urge the United States to enunciate strategies that reinforce U.S. economic engagement broadly across the Asia-Pacific region, beyond the current TPP membership, to prevent the perception of neglecting important countries in the region. Congress may need to consider whether existing U.S. economic initiatives are sufficient to further U.S. influence across the region or if other initiatives are advisable to assure commitment to the region. Washington may need to consider expanding economic initiatives in Asia to enhance U.S. influence in the region. Congress should also evaluate if the TPP should include countries outside the region and its impact on the multilateral trading system. Congress may need to consider expanding economic initiatives in Asia to enhance U.S. influence in the region. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations like the TPP may impact the multilateral trading system. Some see it as an opportunity for the U.S. to advance new trade rules, while others worry about the potential negative impact on countries not involved in the negotiations. The TPP is seen as an opportunity for the US to advance new trade rules and disciplines, but there are concerns it may undermine the WTO and negatively impact non-participating countries. Congress needs to consider if the TPP will promote global trade liberalization or lead to fragmentation of the trading system. From a strategic standpoint, Congress may need to consider if the proposed TPP will support WTO multilateral trade liberalization or cause fragmentation in the global trading system. They should also think about pursuing new trade initiatives globally to ensure the TPP encourages momentum at the global level and to address concerns about shifting trade discussions away from the WTO."
