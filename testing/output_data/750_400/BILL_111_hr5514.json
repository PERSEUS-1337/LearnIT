The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to the States annually, including funds for health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture through various means such as grants, loans, and direct appropriations. The Federal Government allocates $36 billion for education and $27 billion for agriculture to the States through various means like grants, loans, and direct appropriations. States spend this money on common activities such as health care, transportation, housing, and education. It is important for taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to have access to reliable data for comparing how effectively these funds are being used. States should be able to objectively compare their performance in utilizing Federal taxpayer dollars across various sectors like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. Activity-based total accountability can identify the most efficient States, promoting competition and effective use of funds. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by implementing activity-based total accountability to identify the most effective States in utilizing taxpayer dollars, promoting competition, and ensuring the best value for taxpayers. The Act aims to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings using total accountability measures, including unit-cost data, to ensure taxpayers get the best value for their dollar.
