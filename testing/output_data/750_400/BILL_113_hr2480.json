The Act may be cited as the Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013. Congress finds that in 2011, registered nurses and nursing assistants reported high numbers of musculoskeletal disorders due to patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries. In 2011, nursing assistants reported the highest number of cases among all occupations, with patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries being the leading cause. These injuries lead many nurses to leave the profession, with a high percentage suffering from chronic back pain severe enough to require leave from work. Many nurses suffer from chronic back pain, leading to a high percentage leaving the profession. Patients are at risk during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning, but appropriate lift programs can reduce injuries. Patients are at risk during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning, but mechanical lift programs can reduce injuries and provide a safer means for patient care. Assistive patient handling technology has made manual patient handling outdated. Assistive patient handling technology has reduced injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers, making manual patient handling outdated. Healthcare facilities that have implemented patient handling technology have reported positive results. Incorporating patient handling technology in healthcare facilities has led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. This has resulted in reduced lost work days due to injury, lower staff turnover rates, and decreased workers' compensation costs. Facilities implementing safe patient handling technology have seen a decrease in lost work days and staff turnover due to injuries. Studies show that this technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several States have adopted safe patient handling standards, proving the feasibility of such programs. Several States have implemented safe patient handling standards, showing success in reducing musculoskeletal disorders. Establishing these standards for healthcare workers is crucial for their safety and addressing the nursing shortage. Injury prevention standard for direct-care registered nurses and other healthcare workers is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and increasing patient safety. The text chunk discusses the Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard, which applies to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. It emphasizes the importance of protecting healthcare workers' health and safety while addressing the nursing shortage and improving patient safety. The Secretary of Labor must create an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within a year of the Act's enactment. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including direct-care registered nurses. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including direct-care registered nurses, through the use of engineering and safety controls. It must be finalized within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard must be finalized within 2 years of the Act's enactment. It requires the use of engineering and safety controls to prevent injuries from manual handling of patients by healthcare workers, including registered nurses. Mechanical technology and devices should be used whenever possible, with alternative controls and measures utilized when not feasible. The standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention aims to protect nurses and healthcare workers by implementing mechanical technology and devices whenever possible. When not feasible, alternative controls like trained lift teams will be used to minimize the risk of injury. This standard applies to all healthcare employers and aligns with national safe patient handling standards. The standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention requires healthcare employers to develop and implement a program within 6 months. This program includes hazard identification and risk assessments. Each health care employer must develop and implement a safe patient handling program within 6 months. The program includes hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures related to patient care duties. Additionally, within 2 years, employers must purchase, use, maintain, and provide access to technology and equipment for health care workers. Within 2 years, health care employers must purchase, use, and maintain safe patient handling equipment and technology as determined by the Secretary. Input from health care workers, including direct care registered nurses, must be obtained. The Secretary determines safe patient handling equipment, technology, and accessories. Health care employers must involve health care workers in developing and implementing the program. The health care employer must involve workers and their representatives in developing and implementing a safe patient handling program, including purchasing technology and equipment. Employers are also required to establish a data tracking and review program to analyze relevant data for the program's implementation. The health care employer must establish a review program to analyze data relevant to the safe patient handling program, including instances where technology or lift teams were not utilized as required. Findings and data from the review must be made available to health care workers upon request. The health care employer must consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling. They should also make findings and data from their review program available to health care workers upon request. The health care employer must incorporate safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling and provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices. The health care employer must provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices, initially and on a continuing annual basis. Training should prepare workers to identify, assess, and control musculoskeletal hazards and be conducted by knowledgeable individuals. The health care employer must provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices, initially and on a continuing annual basis. Training should prepare workers to identify, assess, and control musculoskeletal hazards, conducted by knowledgeable individuals, in an interactive simulated point-of-care format reflecting the specific demands of health care workers' duties. Additionally, each health care employer must post a uniform notice specified by the Secretary regarding safe patient handling and rights under this act. The health care employer must post a uniform notice specified by the Secretary regarding safe patient handling and rights under this act, explaining procedures to report patient handling. The health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, training, and procedures for reporting injuries, as well as health care workers' rights under the Act. The health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, including procedures, technology, equipment, and assessment of injuries. Nurses and other health care workers should be involved in the evaluation process. The evaluation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program includes technology, equipment, and controls selection, assessment of injuries, and involvement of healthcare workers in the process. Employers must take corrective action based on the evaluation. Health care employers must document input from representatives and bargaining agents in evaluations, taking corrective action as recommended. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards and could result in injury. A health care worker can refuse duties if they believe it violates safety standards and could cause harm to themselves or others. The worker must have raised concerns to the employer without resolution. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards if a health care worker raises safety concerns to their employer without resolution.
