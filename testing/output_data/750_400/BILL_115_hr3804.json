    "content": "The \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" is the short title of this Act. The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. This highlights the need for improved planning to mitigate the impact of disasters and terrorism on communities. The Federal Government should support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into comprehensive land use planning to improve community safety and reduce the costly relief programs and disruptive security measures imposed on United States taxpayers. The Federal Government and State governments should support integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into land use planning and urban development to reduce post-disaster costs and prioritize prevention strategies. Disaster planning should focus on prevention and incorporate mitigation strategies from various professional fields like urban planning, architecture, and landscape architecture. Comprehensive planning can effectively reduce post-disaster costs and prioritize prevention strategies. Disaster planning should prioritize prevention and incorporate strategies from urban planning, architecture, and landscape architecture. Comprehensive planning can reduce post-disaster costs and enhance prevention efforts. The Federal Government and States should support comprehensive planning for safe communities by providing a conducive statutory environment. Many States lack land use statutes that currently support comprehensive planning for safe communities. Efforts are being made to update state land use statutes to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, including long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. State and regional investments need to be coordinated with local plans, requiring additional state-level planning. Efforts are being made by many States to update and reform statutes for better planning that incorporates long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. State and regional investments, including at-risk public infrastructure, need additional State-level planning. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, water and wastewater facilities, open space, and critical infrastructure to promote safe and economically viable communities. Local governments should integrate safety measures. Comprehensive urban planning integrates safety considerations and modern planning techniques to ensure safe housing options for all community members. Safe housing is crucial for safe community development, and comprehensive planning should incorporate modern planning techniques to ensure a variety of safe housing options are available. Prevailing land use patterns can put people, structures, and environmental systems at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns facing significant growth pressures. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to address growth pressures and haphazard development patterns in rural communities and small towns on the metropolitan fringe. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards, including acts of terror. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror.

The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards. To be eligible for the grant, a State or local planning director must demonstrate citizen engagement, multi-jurisdictional cooperation, and stakeholder involvement in the planning process. Multi-disciplinary planning processes are necessary for developing, adopting, and updating land use plans. Multi-jurisdictional cooperation is essential for assessing risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts, leading to the creation of planning legislation and regulations. Multi-agency coordination, including cooperation between Federal agencies, is also crucial for effective risk assessment. Land use plans are created through multi-agency coordination involving Federal, State, and local government agencies. Implementation elements include a timetable for action and defining roles and responsibilities. Land use plans involve coordination among Federal, State, and local government agencies. Implementation elements include a timetable for action, defining roles and responsibilities, and decision-making framework for future infrastructure development. Comprehensive planning encourages incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, urban design guidelines, and building codes at the state or local level. Comprehensive planning at the state or local level includes incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. The government also addresses how these plans will be updated over time. The State or local government must update comprehensive plans, including land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans over time. Grant funds received must be used for specific purposes outlined in the legislation. Grant funds received by a State or local government must be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, assessing critical public infrastructure, and mapping for land use and community development policies. The grant funds are used for developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation, assessing public infrastructure, and developing geographical information systems. The curr_chunk focuses on developing geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, and incorporating mitigation and security elements.
