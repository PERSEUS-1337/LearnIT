    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 3962 would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over a 10-year period. By 2019, the bill would insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population, with a total cost of $1.052 trillion for Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers. The bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population by 2019. The total cost of coverage provisions would be $891 billion over 10 years, offset by other spending changes according to the CBO analysis. The net cost of the coverage provisions in the Affordable Health Act would be $891 billion over 10 years, offset by other spending changes saving $427 billion and increased federal revenues by $574 billion. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives, focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance. The bill includes provisions that would save $427 billion in spending changes and increase federal revenues by $574 billion through an income tax surcharge on high-income individuals. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, focuses on reducing the number of uninsured by requiring individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. The bill includes market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue, as well as provisions to raise revenues. H.R. 3962 focuses on reducing the number of uninsured by requiring individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue would be implemented, along with provisions to raise revenues. Acceptable health insurance coverage would be linked to both individual and employer mandates, incorporating required minimum standards and market reforms. The bill includes modified community rating and guaranteed issue, linking individual and employer mandates to acceptable health insurance coverage under a qualified health benefits plan offered through the Exchange or other plans like Medicare and Medicaid. The Exchange would be overseen by the Health Choices Administration Commissioner. The newly created Exchange, overseen by the Health Choices Administration Commissioner, would offer private plans alongside a public option. Subsidies for premium costs and cost-sharing would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level, but only through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely under certain conditions. The Exchange would offer private plans alongside a public option. Individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for subsidies toward their premium costs and cost-sharing, available only through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely under specific conditions. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage the creation of not-for-profit, member-run health plans. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage the creation of not-for-profit, member-run health insurance cooperatives that would operate in the Exchange. This bill would not affect plans covering specific services like dental or vision care. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts. The bill aims to establish not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with no impact on dental or vision care plans. Revenues would be generated by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts. The report provides background information on the private insurance market and how H.R. 3962 would reform health insurance. The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in Division A of H.R. 3962, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, including establishing not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The report outlines provisions in H.R. 3962 affecting private health insurance, focusing on changes to current markets for individuals buying coverage directly or through small employers, effective from 2013 onwards. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to change how private health insurance markets operate, particularly for individuals buying coverage directly or through small employers. Insurers would be required to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions and not charge them higher premiums. This aims to prevent adverse selection and stabilize premiums. H.R. 3962 aims to prevent adverse selection by requiring insurers to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions and not charge them higher premiums. Insurers often guard against adverse selection by excluding pre-existing conditions. If reform eliminates these tools, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) has expressed concerns. Insurers guard against adverse selection by excluding preexisting conditions, which can lead to higher premiums and more uninsured individuals. AHIP suggests that individuals must be required to purchase coverage to prevent only the sick from enrolling. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary if individuals are mandated to obtain health insurance. The health insurers association suggests that individuals must be mandated to purchase coverage to prevent adverse selection. Adequate premium subsidies may be needed to make the individual mandate practical and ensure market reforms. The government and/or employers need to implement the individual mandate for health insurance to make market reforms possible. Premium subsidies without cost-sharing may provide unaffordable health insurance. Removing one provision from the bill could harm the implementation of others. Private health insurance provisions are outlined in Division A of H.R. 3962. The private health insurance provisions in Division A of H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with a public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other related measures. Removing any provision could hinder the implementation of the rest. The private health insurance provisions in Division A of H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with a public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other related measures. Employers must provide health insurance or pay into the Exchange, with penalties for noncompliance. Americans obtain health insurance through various methods, such as employment-based coverage or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, obtained through private sector or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. There is no federal law mandating individuals to have health insurance or employers to offer it. Approximately 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance in 2008, either through private sector or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. Employers can choose to offer health coverage by purchasing insurance or self-funding benefits. Around 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers purchasing health insurance in the private market falling into three segments: large group, small group, and nongroup markets. The large group (large employer) market, the small group market, and the nongroup market are segments in the private health insurance market. Large employers, who make up more than 95% of large employers, can obtain lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool, making costs more predictable. Large employers can obtain lower premiums for health insurance packages compared to small employers and individuals in the nongroup market due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Employers offer subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers. States have experimented with creating a single site for individuals and small employers to compare different options. States have experimented with creating a single site for individuals and small employers to compare different insurance plans and pool risk. Some past experiments failed, but others have developed more sustainable models. Private-sector companies also play a role in facilitating access to insurance. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance coverage due to cost concerns. Past experiments in creating single sites for insurance comparison and risk pooling have had mixed results, with some states like Massachusetts developing more sustainable models. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance also help individuals and small groups compare insurance plans. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance facilitate the comparison of health insurance plans for individuals and small groups. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance coverage, primarily due to cost concerns and the limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Insurers view small firms as less stable than larger pools, as minor changes in the pool can have a significant impact on risk. Small employers cite cost as the main reason for not providing health benefits. Limited ability to spread risk across a small pool is a key factor. Small firms are viewed as less stable by insurers compared to larger pools, as minor changes can have a significant impact on risk. Other disadvantages include being medically underwritten, having little market power to negotiate benefits and rates, and lacking economies of scale. Small employers face challenges in providing health insurance due to factors like limited ability to spread risk, being medically underwritten, and lacking market power. Allowing them to purchase insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. Individuals in the nongroup market may face rejection or higher premiums based on health status. Allowing small employers and individuals in the nongroup market to purchase insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees and those with health issues. Reforms affecting premium ratings may increase costs for some based on age, health, and behaviors. Reforms in the private health insurance market may lead to varied premium changes based on age, health, and behaviors. States primarily regulate this market, with federal regulations impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. HIPAA mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups. States regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations affecting employer-sponsored health insurance. HIPAA mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups, ensuring acceptance for all small employers applying for coverage. Some states also require guaranteed issue policies for self-employed individuals. In the small group and individual health insurance markets, states require issuers to offer guaranteed issue coverage to small employers and self-employed individuals. Premium rating rules are also imposed on insurance carriers in most states. In the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in their nongroup markets. The spectrum of state rating limitations ranges from pure community rating to adjusted community rating, to rate bands, to no restrictions. Pure community rating means all plan enrollees pay the same premium regardless of health or age. New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in nongroup markets. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows for age or gender. Rate bands allow limited premium variation based on health factors. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows for age or gender. Rate bands allow limited premium variation based on health, with variation limited according to a range specified by the state. Federal law requires group health plans to limit the period of rating in their nongroup markets, with only New York imposing pure community rating rules in the small group market. In the small group market, 21 states had preexisting condition exclusion rules above the federal standard as of January 2009. In the individual market, 42 states limit the period for excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions as of December 2008. Health coverage in small group and individual markets must limit the period for excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions. As of January 2009, 21 states had rules above the federal standard in the small group market, and as of December 2008, 42 states limited the period for excluding coverage in the individual market. Additionally, there are over 2,000 state-imposed benefit mandates for health insurance, with congressional attention on the debate over a publicly sponsored health insurance plan. Some proponents argue for a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform, potentially offering a less expensive alternative without the need for profits or broker fees. This public option could increase choice for individuals. A public option for health insurance is seen as a potentially cheaper alternative to private plans, as it would not need to make profits or pay brokers. Proponents argue that it could increase competition and choice by offering lower premiums. However, opponents question whether this would give the government an unfair advantage in setting prices. The public option for health insurance could increase competition by offering lower premiums, but opponents fear it may give the government an unfair advantage in setting prices and drive private plans from the market. Studies have shown that non-profit health insurance organizations perform better than for-profit ones. Some studies suggest that non-profit health insurance organizations outperform for-profit ones in key areas such as quality. For example, a study in JAMA found that non-profit HMOs scored higher on quality measures. Non-profit health insurance organizations, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and health insurance co-operatives, have been shown to perform better in quality measures compared to for-profit counterparts. Studies published in JAMA and conducted by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and NCQA support this finding. Case studies of Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners further highlight the success of non-profit plans in delivering quality healthcare. In a 2006 study of 272 health plans, non-profit health insurance organizations, including health insurance co-operatives, were found to perform well. Case studies of Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners of Minnesota also demonstrated their success. Congressional attention has been focused on incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. Advocates argue that health insurance co-operatives reinvest earnings for lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative programs. Congressional focus is on incentivizing new co-operatives, while opponents question their success. Advocates argue that health insurance co-operatives reinvest earnings for lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative programs. Opponents question their success and the affordability of health insurance through co-operatives. Several provisions of the bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013, focusing on administrative steps leading up to full implementation. Co-operatives have not been successful in most of the country and evidence is lacking that they would make health insurance more affordable. Several provisions of the bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013, with some being administrative in nature and necessary steps leading up to full implementation. Postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits would be prohibited, and individuals would be allowed to keep their COBRA coverage until the Exchange is up. Prior to full implementation on January 1, 2013, some provisions include prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, and establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program. The Secretary would establish a temporary national high-risk pool program to provide health benefits to eligible individuals during the period beginning on January 1, 2010, and ending when the Health Insurance Exchange is established. Each health insurance issuer would provide a rebate if the coverage has a medical loss ratio below a level specified by the Secretary. This provision sunsets once plans are offered via the Exchange. The bill includes provisions for health insurance issuers to provide rebates if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level, with a minimum of 85%. This provision applies to both small and large group markets, as well as the individual market unless destabilization is a concern. Issuers must justify any premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. Additionally, individuals up to age 26 can remain on their parents' plans. The bill requires health insurance issuers to justify premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. It allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' plans. Pre-existing conditions look-back period is reduced to 30 days, and coverage exclusions are shortened. Acts of domestic violence cannot be considered pre-existing. The bill reduces pre-existing condition look-back period to 30 days, shortens coverage exclusions, prohibits domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, mandates coverage for dependent child's deformity, and bans lifetime benefit limits. The bill prohibits domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and bans lifetime benefit limits for both group and individual markets. The Secretary will issue guidance to limit rescission of health insurance policies. The bill prohibits domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and bans lifetime benefit limits in group and individual markets. The Secretary will issue guidance to limit health insurance policy rescission and establish a temporary reinsurance program to assist employment-based plans with providing health benefits. H.R. 3962 mandates most individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes qualified health benefits plans, employment-based plans, and grandfathered nongroup plans. H.R. 3962 mandates most individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance, requiring acceptable coverage under various plans including QHBP, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, and coverage determined by the Secretary. Individuals must have acceptable health insurance coverage under various plans, including employment-based, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, veteran's health care, and services for members of Indian tribes. Failure to maintain coverage may result in an additional tax penalty based on income. Individuals without acceptable health insurance coverage may face an additional tax penalty based on income, calculated as 2.5% of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income or the national average premium. Subsidies are available for some individuals to help with premium and cost-sharing expenses. Exemptions from the penalty are also possible. Individuals may be exempt from the tax penalty for not having health insurance if they are nonresident aliens, living outside the US, in US territories, have religious exemptions, are tax dependents, or granted an exemption by the Secretary. Employers would also have obligations under H.R. 3962. H.R. 3962 exempts certain individuals from the individual mandate, such as nonresident aliens, those living outside the US, and those with religious exemptions. Employers are required to offer health insurance or contribute to the Exchange, including private-sector employers, churches, and government entities. H.R. 3962 mandates employers to provide health insurance or contribute to the Exchange for their employees, with exceptions for certain individuals. This includes private-sector employers, churches, and government entities. Employers can offer coverage through a QHBP or current plan, with rules for eligibility outlined. Grandfathered plans are allowed for five years before transitioning to new employer-offered plans. Employers offering health insurance must adhere to specific rules. They can provide coverage through an Exchange plan or employment-based plan, with grandfathered plans allowed for five years. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current plan offered, with salary reductions not permitted to offset contributions. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current plan offered, with salary reductions not permitted to offset contributions. Employers would automatically enroll employees into the plan for individual coverage unless the employee opts out. Written notice detailing employee rights must be provided by employers. Employers must automatically enroll employees into the plan for individual coverage with the lowest premium, unless the employee opts out. Written notice detailing employee rights and obligations must be provided by employers to show compliance with health participation requirements. Employers must provide written notice detailing employee rights and obligations regarding auto enrollment in health plans. Information required for compliance includes certification of offering enrollment in a health plan, monthly premiums, employee enrollment details, and other necessary information. The Secretary of HHS, in coordination with the Commissioner, could terminate an employer's health insurance election for substantial noncompliance. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer coverage may face an 8% excise tax. Smaller employers have different payroll assessment requirements. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage may be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees can opt out of employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with the employer still facing the 8% assessment. Beginning in 2014, employees can decline employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with employers facing an 8% excise tax for those who opt out. This tax does not apply to employees covered as dependents in an Exchange plan. Employees who decline employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan may be subject to an 8% excise tax for wages above $750,000. This tax does not apply to employees covered as dependents in an Exchange plan. The employer's payroll assessment for these individuals goes into the Exchange but does not count towards the individual's premium. Full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer may not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits if they opt for Exchange coverage. Certain small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards their share of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. This credit phases out as average employee compensation increases from $20,000. Small businesses opting for Exchange coverage over employer's qualifying coverage would pay 100% of the premium. Eligible small businesses could receive a 50% credit towards employee health coverage for up to two years, phased out as average employee compensation increases from $20,000 to $40,000. The credit does not apply to highly compensated employees with compensation exceeding $80,000. Adjustments for inflation would be made to average employee compensation. Employee compensation increased from $20,000 to $40,000 as the number of employees rose from 10 to 25. The credit for employee health coverage does not apply to highly compensated employees with compensation over $80,000. Adjustments for inflation will be made to average employee compensation and the limit on highly compensated employees after tax year 2013. The small business credit is part of the general business credit and is non-refundable, available only to businesses with a tax liability. Non-profit organizations are ineligible for this credit. The small business credit for employee health coverage will have adjustments for inflation after 2013. It is part of the general business credit and is non-refundable, available only to businesses with a tax liability. Non-profit organizations are ineligible for this credit.

Coverage must be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. The provisions in H.R. 3962 require health coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis, with premiums determined using adjusted community rating rules. Premiums under H.R. 3962 would be determined using adjusted community rating rules, allowing variation based only on age by a 2:1 ratio specified by the Commissioner. Under H.R. 3962, premiums would be allowed to vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment, while imposing new non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks. Under H.R. 3962, premiums can vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks are imposed, along with mental health parity rules. Coverage must offer the option to keep dependent children under 27 on the family policy. Enrollees must be notified of any premium decreases. H.R. 3962 imposes new non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks, including mental health parity rules. It requires coverage to offer the option of keeping dependent children under 27 on the family policy and notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing. QHBPs must cover certain benefits, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, and ban annual and lifetime benefit limits on covered healthcare services. H.R. 3962 mandates QHBPs to notify enrollees of any coverage changes 90 days in advance. It also requires coverage of specific benefits, prohibits cost-sharing on preventive services, limits out-of-pocket spending, and bans annual and lifetime benefit limits. Existing group plans must meet QHBP standards by 2018. H.R. 3962 mandates that new individual policies issued after 2013 must be offered as Exchange plans, while existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies can be grandfathered as long as there are no changes to coverage terms, benefits, or cost-sharing, with premiums only increasing according to statute. States are allowed to form Health Care plans under this legislation. H.R. 3962 mandates that new individual policies issued after 2013 must be offered as Exchange plans, while existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies can be grandfathered as long as there are no changes to coverage terms, benefits, or cost-sharing, with premiums only increasing according to statute. States are allowed to form Health Care Choice Compacts for the sale of individual health insurance plans across state lines. H.R. 3962 mandates new individual policies to be offered as Exchange plans after 2013. Existing group plans must meet QHBP standards by 2018. States can form Health Care Choice Compacts for selling individual health insurance across state lines. The Secretary would work with NAIC to develop guidelines for these compacts. Grants would be available for states to regulate health insurance coverage in secondary states. QHBPs must cover certain minimum requirements. The Health Care Choice Compacts allow health insurance coverage to be sold across state lines, with grants available for states to regulate activities related to this. QHBPs must cover essential benefits and comply with specific standards. QHBPs must cover the essential benefits package, including specified items and services, with limitations on cost-sharing, out-of-pocket spending, and benefit limits. Compliance with network adequacy standards is required, and the scope of benefits should be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. The essential benefits package for QHBPs must comply with network adequacy standards and be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. It includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, and rehabilitative/habilitative services. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes hospital and clinic services, emergency department services, physician and health professional services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, well baby and child care, and durable medical equipment. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes a wide range of services such as hospital and clinic services, emergency department services, physician and health professional services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, well baby and child care, and durable medical equipment. Additionally, certain preventive services and vaccines have no cost-sharing permitted, with an annual out-of-pocket limit set at $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation. The Secretary would establish cost-sharing levels using copayments rather than coinsurance. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes a wide range of services such as hospital and clinic services, emergency department services, physician and health professional services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, well baby and child care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments instead of coinsurance, covering an average of 70% of covered health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could also be specified by the Health Benefits Advisory Committee and the HHS Secretary. The essential benefits package for QHBPs covers a wide range of services with cost-sharing levels established using copayments, covering an average of 70% of covered health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have less cost-sharing or richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans would have flexibility in offering plans with employee cost-sharing less than the essential benefits package. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, including benefits, cost-sharing levels, and updates. Employer plans could offer cost-sharing levels lower than those specified for the essential benefits package. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, including benefits, cost-sharing levels, and updates. The Committee would develop cost-sharing structures consistent with actuarial values for different plan tiers. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Secretary would need to adopt the benefit standards recommended by HBAC within 45 days or provide reasons for not doing so. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Secretary must adopt the benefit standards within 45 days or provide reasons for not doing so. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by certain individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would not be an insurer but provide eligible individuals with options. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and establish a Health Insurance Exchange, similar to existing entities like the Massachusetts Connector and eHealthInsurance. The Exchange would not be an insurer but would provide access to insurers' plans for eligible individuals and small businesses, similar to how travel websites provide access to flights and fares. The Exchange would also have additional responsibilities such as negotiating with plans and enforcing requirements. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would provide access to insurers' plans for eligible individuals and small businesses, similar to travel websites like Travelocity or Expedia. It would be established under a new independent federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, headed by a Commissioner. The Exchange would also negotiate with plans, oversee requirements, and determine eligibility for premium and cost-sharing credits. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established by a new independent federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, headed by a Commissioner. It would oversee and enforce plan requirements, determine eligibility for premium and cost-sharing credits, and be funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund would cover startup and operating costs, premium and cost-sharing credits through taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. Only one Exchange could operate in a state, overseen by the Commissioner. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund would cover startup and operating costs, premium and cost-sharing credits through taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. State-based Exchanges would be funded through a federal matching grant to states, with additional sums as necessary to be appropriated for the Exchange. Only one Exchange could operate in a state, overseen by the Commissioner. State-based Exchanges would be funded through a federal matching grant to states. The Commissioner would establish a process to work with states operating an Exchange before January 1, 2010. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange, where the public health insurance option and income-based premium and cost-sharing credits would be available. Small employers could offer and contribute toward coverage through the Exchange. CBO estimated that by 2019, 30 million people would obtain Exchange coverage. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange. The public health insurance option and income-based premium and cost-sharing credits would be available through the Exchange. CBO estimated that by 2019, 30 million people would obtain Exchange coverage, with 9 million getting it through a qualified employer. About 6 million are projected to enroll in the public health insurance option. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employee. By 2019, 30 million people were projected to have Exchange coverage, with 9 million through a qualified employer. About 6 million were expected to enroll in the public health insurance option. Eligibility for Exchange coverage was available unless enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employee, Medicare, or Medicaid. Loss of eligibility would occur once eligible for Medicare Part A, Medicaid, or other circumstances determined by the Commissioner. Individuals would generally lose eligibility for Exchange coverage once they become eligible for Medicare Part A, Medicaid, and other circumstances as the Commissioner provides. An open-enrollment period would be offered annually, lasting at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for certain circumstances like loss of acceptable coverage. Once individuals enroll in an Exchange plan, they remain eligible until they are no longer enrolled. An annual open-enrollment period would be held from September to November for at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers can meet the employer mandate by offering and contributing to employees' enrollment through the Exchange, allowing employees to choose from available plans. Exchange-eligible employers can meet the employer mandate by offering and contributing to employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible in 2013, 50 or fewer in 2014, and 100 or fewer in 2015. Once enrolled through the Exchange, employers would continue to be Exchange-eligible unless they offer their own QHBPs. In 2015, the Commissioner could permit larger employers to participate in the Exchange, phased in based on full-time employees or other considerations. Exchange plans must meet new federal requirements. Beginning in 2015, the Commissioner could allow larger employers to join the Exchange, phased in based on full-time employees or other criteria. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and offer standardized cost-sharing options in four tiers. An Exchange-participating entity must provide only one Basic plan meeting essential minimum requirements.

The reference premium used for credit calculation is based on the three lowest-priced Basic plans in the area. The government and enrollees contribute to premiums based on income tiers, with the reference premium calculated from the three lowest-priced Basic plans in the area. Premium percentage limits are set by the Commissioner to ensure consistency in contributions. The \"affordability premium credit\" would be calculated based on how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable premium amount, with percentage limits increasing on a sliding scale for individuals with family incomes between specified tiers.

Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidy payments from the federal government. These subsidies are excludible from the employer's gross income for tax purposes. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage. The amount allowable as a deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage would be reduced by the amount of the federal subsidy received.

The Secretary is satisfied that state laws enacted after the bill's enactment date and meeting certain requirements are effective. The effectiveness is determined by improving the medical liability system, encouraging error disclosure, and maintaining access to affordable insurance. State laws must include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and not limit attorneys' fees or impose damage caps.
