Information extraction is approached as a supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised learning problem. Unsupervised methods like Open Information Extraction BID4 do not require training data but are limited to unstructured data. The literature covers information extraction, relation extraction from biomedical text, and semi-supervised and ensemble learning methods. Information extraction can be fully-supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised. Unsupervised methods like Open Information Extraction BID4 do not use training data, while fully-supervised methods rely on labeled examples. Semi-supervised methods, like bootstrapping algorithms, leverage both labeled and unlabeled data. Bootstrapping algorithms like DIRPE, Snowball, KnowItAll, and TextRunner leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for information extraction. Recent approaches also consider contextual data augmentation for paraphrasing training samples.

The approach aims to augment a gold-labeled training set with additional lower quality data to improve model training. The approach advocates augmenting a gold-labeled training set with lower quality data using machine learning models of lower complexity as weak supervision sources. This allows for scaling the dataset size without relying on heuristics or crowd-sourced labels. To scale the dataset size, machine learning models of lower complexity are used as weak supervision sources instead of heuristics or crowd-sourced labels. The approach requires a labeled training set D B of size m, an unlabeled dataset D U of size M m from the same distribution as D B, a validation set D V for hyperparameter tuning, and a held-out test set D T for evaluation. We assume the existence of a labeled training set D B of size m for task T, along with an unlabeled dataset D U of size M m from the same distribution.

After producing the base learners, only a subset is selected to maximize computational efficiency and avoid including many similar classifiers in a disagreement-based method. After producing base learners like LSTMs & CNNs, a subset is selected to maximize computational efficiency and diversity. Discarding classifiers below a performance threshold helps in achieving this objective. Our objective is to maximize the individual performance of base learners and their diversity by discarding classifiers below a performance threshold while maximizing diversity. This threshold is set above the random guess baseline but low enough to allow less accurate classifiers in the ensemble. The most diverse classifiers are selected using a similarity-based clustering method. To maximize base learners' performance and diversity, a threshold is set above random guess baseline but low enough to include less accurate classifiers. The most diverse classifiers are chosen using a similarity-based clustering method, where a KxK similarity matrix is constructed based on predictions of base learners. K-means clustering is then performed on this matrix to select base learners closest to cluster centroids. Using predictions of K base learners on DV, a KxK similarity matrix is constructed based on inter-annotator agreement rates. K-means clustering is performed to select representative base learners. The silhouette score coefficient is used to determine the appropriate number of clusters. The labels of DU are predicted using selected base learners to obtain a KxM prediction matrix. To determine the number of clusters, the silhouette score coefficient BID32 is used. The labels of DU are predicted using selected base learners to obtain a KxM prediction matrix, which is then denoised to produce weak labels. Hyperparameters are selected using a validation dataset, and simpler denoisers are considered to unify the label matrix. In practice, denoisers are used to reduce the vote matrix into weak labels generated by base learners distilled from D B. The probabilistic Generative Model of data programming is employed to select hyperparameters using a validation dataset. Two simpler denoisers, Majority Vote and Average Vote, are considered to unify the label matrix. Finally, a discriminative model is used as a meta-learner, trading label quality for quantity during training with weak supervision. The Majority Vote denoiser produces binary weak labels, while the Average Vote denoiser calculates an unweighted average of base learner votes, resulting in marginal weak labels. A discriminative model is used as a meta-learner, training with weak supervision to benefit from a larger training set size and high-capacity models like Deep Neural Networks. This allows the meta-learner to learn its own features and build a more accurate representation, even with noisy data.

It determines the optimal setting for weak supervision by selecting base learners based on a specific strategy and experimenting with different numbers to maximize silhouette scores. The performance of base learners, weak labels produced by denoisers, and the meta-learner trained on weak labels is compared with full supervision. Training the meta-learner with weak labels (D U) and a 2 \u2212 2.5x increase in the training set size consistently outperforms training with fewer gold labels (D B). Performance is further enhanced when ground-truth labels are included (D B + D U), demonstrating successful augmentation of training data using weak supervision. Weak supervision can successfully augment additional training data, achieving comparable performance to full supervision and sometimes even slightly better results. Training with weak labels and a larger training set size consistently outperforms training with fewer gold labels. Including ground-truth labels further enhances performance. Weak supervision can achieve comparable performance to full supervision and sometimes even slightly better results.

It was noted that under-sampled training sets in weak supervision were larger, based on weak labels instead of real ones. Additionally, Majority Vote often outperformed the meta-learner, but this was expected given the small training dataset used.

Visualizing the learning curves of the meta-learner showed an upward trend with statistically significant results. The F1 score on the training set consistently improved. The meta-learner's learning curves show an upward trend with statistically significant results. The F1 score on the training set consistently outperforms the test score, indicating high variance and potential overfitting. Additional training data is needed to improve the meta-learner's performance. The F1 score on the training set is much higher than the test score, indicating high variance and overfitting in the meta-learner. Additional training data is needed to improve performance. The small dataset size limits definitive conclusions, but an analysis based on experimental results will be conducted. The F1 score of weak Majority Vote labels for 5 learners is the lowest in both experiments. Based on experimental results, the F1 score of weak Majority Vote labels for 5 learners is the lowest. The Generative model weak marginals show no significant pattern, with F1 scores fluctuating within 1.5 & 2.5 points. The meta-learner's performance improves with more than 10 base learners but is consistently better than with only 5 base learners. When trained with Generative model weak marginals, the meta-learner's performance shows slight improvement as the number of base learners increases, except for two exceptions. In most cases, the meta-learner achieves the best performance when trained with Average Marginals, outperforming Majority Vote weak labels. When using Generative Model marginals, the metalearner's performance improves with more base learners, except for two cases. Overall, training with Average Marginals yields the best performance. Generative Model marginals also enhance performance compared to Majority Vote weak labels, except for one case. However, GM marginals depend on hyperparameters chosen based on F1 score validation, which may not fully reflect performance under different weak label distributions. The GM marginals depend on hyperparameters chosen based on F1 score validation. Marginal weak labels improve the meta-learner's performance compared to binary labels. Majority Vote weak labels always perform worse than Average marginals without hyperparameter tuning. The denoisers can produce weak labels, either binary or marginal. Marginal weak labels improve the meta-learner's performance compared to binary labels. Generative Model tends to create marginals following a U-shaped distribution, while average marginals are spread more uniformly. Error analysis on the validation set shows misclassified weak labels. The Generative Model tends to create marginals following a U-shaped distribution, with average marginals being more uniformly spread. Error analysis on the validation set shows misclassified weak labels, with Average Vote labels of higher quality due to their proximity to 0.5. The F1 score is shown to be unsuitable for evaluating the performance in this context. The training loss and validation scores change as the LSTM is trained for more epochs, showing that when marginal labels are used, the training error remains high. Average weak marginals are spread out, while it only takes a few epochs for the amount of misclassified weak labels to stabilize. The F1 score is not suitable for evaluating marginal weak labels. Training a classifier with marginal labels is akin to a regression problem, where the model predicts an exact number and is penalized for errors. LSTM quickly learns to predict binary training labels accurately, despite a delay with noisy-labeled weak marginals. In practice, training a classifier with marginal labels is treated as a regression problem. The model is required to predict an exact number and is penalized for any errors. The predicted logits become more spread as the training marginals distributions become more uniform, resembling regression rather than classification. This methodology is being applied to the CPR task. In applying the methodology to the CPR task, efforts are made to expand datasets with labeled and unlabeled data. Using CHEMPROT documents for training base learners and constructing D U with BID19, the performance of the meta-learner decreases with the addition of weakly labeled data, indicating issues with data quality or weak labels.
