The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 addresses issues caused by unfair provisions in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Canadian grain exports, particularly durum wheat, spring wheat, and barley, have flooded the US market, leading to depressed prices, financial losses for American farmers, and challenges in implementing domestic support programs. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to address the negative impact of Canadian grain exports on American farmers, causing depressed prices and financial losses. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to address the negative impact of Canadian grain exports on American farmers by pursuing consultations with Canada regarding the price setting policy of the CWB. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to establish a method for determining the price at which the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) sells agricultural goods to the United States and the CWB's acquisition price for those goods. The implementing legislation requires immediate consultation with the Government of Canada to obtain exclusion from transport rates.

The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 requires immediate consultation with the Government of Canada to obtain exclusion from transport rates for agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the United States.

The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 requires immediate consultation with the Government of Canada to obtain exclusion from transport rates for agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the United States. However, there has been no progress on these consultations, and the failure to pursue them led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The Trade Agreement prohibits selling agricultural goods for export below the acquisition price plus related costs. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

The amendment aims to counteract transportation subsidies by the Government of Canada to promote grain sales to Mexico and the sale of wheat in foreign markets by the Canadian Wheat Board at a price below acquisition cost. The requirements aim to counteract transportation subsidies by the Government of Canada and the sale of wheat below acquisition cost in foreign markets.
