The term 'qualified contributions' refers to all contributions to these consortia for research purposes. Qualified contributions to qualified cooperative research consortia for qualified research are subject to limitations and shall not exceed a certain amount. Qualified contributions to cooperative research consortia for qualified research are limited by a private source funding ratio. The taxpayer's contribution limit is based on the private source funding ratio, which is calculated as 50% of the organization's gross receipts. The private source funding ratio is calculated as 50% of the organization's gross receipts for the preceding taxable year, plus 30% of the ratio for the second preceding taxable year. The private source funding ratio is calculated based on the organization's total gross receipts for the taxable year, with additional percentages from the two preceding years. Contributions representing costs are not considered qualified contributions for this calculation. For the private source funding ratio calculation, costs allocated to services by a taxpayer's employees exceeding cash contributions and overhead allocated to services by employees exceeding certain limits are not considered qualified contributions. Contributions exceeding cash contributions and overhead limits are not considered qualified contributions.
