The report focuses on the compendium entries profiling specific laws, particularly in the \"Human Resources Management and Ethics\" section, which presents civil service laws according to their codification in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry includes a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and issues, along with source readings for further information. The report provides historical background on the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, discusses comparing management in public and private sectors, and analyzes major themes in general management laws. This report delves into the historical roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, explores the comparison of management in public and private sectors, and analyzes key themes in general management laws. The debate over whether the President or Congress should control federal agencies is a longstanding issue. The debate over whether the President or Congress should control federal agencies is a longstanding issue. Scholars have long debated their constitutional roles and the balance of power between the two branches in managing the executive branch. The U.S. Constitution established a system of separated powers and checks and balances, with both Congress and the President playing a role in managing the executive branch. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the importance of diffusing power to secure liberty. The U.S. Constitution established separated powers and checks and balances between Congress and the President in managing federal agencies. Justice Robert Jackson highlighted the need to diffuse power for liberty. The question remains on how power should be shared between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. The Constitution diffuses power to secure liberty and outlines the shared power between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Congress has the authority to establish administrative agencies and determine their operations. The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws necessary for their operation. It also gives the President significant authority in managing the executive branch. Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws necessary for carrying out its powers. The President has the authority to manage the executive branch, ensuring that laws are faithfully executed. The President has considerable power to manage the executive branch, as outlined in Article II of the Constitution. This power is limited, with the President's duty being to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions. The 'take Care' clause does not grant the President power to frustrate congressional intention. Article II only makes two explicit references to executive departments. Article II of the Constitution grants the President power to manage the executive branch, ensuring officials obey Congress's instructions. The 'take Care' clause does not give the President authority to frustrate congressional intention. It explicitly mentions the President's ability to require written opinions from department heads and appoint heads of departments. In 1789, Congress enacted laws establishing the Treasury Department and the federal government's basic structure. In September 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and set annual salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War. This included provisions for warrants, accounts, and audits, as well as a salary cap for clerk positions in these departments. The federal government's financial management system was established by Congress in 1789, including provisions for warrants, accounts, and audits. A law was also passed to set annual salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War, with a salary cap for clerk positions in these departments. By the end of the 18th century, only these three departments, the Navy Department, the office of Attorney General, and the Post Office had been created. Elected officials faced challenges in administering the growing nation after its founding. After the nation's founding, elected officials gradually faced greater difficulty in administering the federal government of a growing nation. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive, effective delegation of authority, and a fiscal system for the government. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive, effective delegation of authority, and a fiscal system for the government. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, continued this framework after coming to power in 1801, with Congress becoming more involved in the administrative system as the country grew in size and population. After Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans took power in 1801, they continued the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more active in dealing with the administrative system as the country grew in size and population. By the end of the 1820s, both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with official work, leading to a rise in federal employment. By the end of the 1820s, federal employment rose significantly from about 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861 as the government administration grew in size and complexity. The structure of executive departments became more intricate over time, with a significant increase in workload for Presidents and department heads. Federal employment increased from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861. The executive departments' structure became more complex by 1860, with departments now consisting of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service. Post-Civil War, further developments occurred. The rise of the administrative state post-Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch due to industrialization, the Progressive Movement, and other significant events. By 1946, Congress had to address the complexity of the situation. The rise of the administrative state post-Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch. By 1946, Congress delegated much legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to reliance on their expertise for policy making and budgeting. By 1946, Congress had delegated a significant amount of its legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to a shift in policy making and budgeting to the executive branch. Observers noted that Congress struggled to legislate in detail and increasingly relied on agencies for expertise, sometimes allowing agencies to exercise legislative powers. In response, Congress expanded general management laws to improve executive branch management practices. Observers noted that agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management laws to improve executive branch practices. This included legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act (1946) and the Freedom of Information Act (1966) to increase transparency in oversight. The CRS compendium highlights Congress's efforts to increase transparency and oversight of the executive branch through legislation such as the Administrative Procedure Act (1946), the Freedom of Information Act (1966), and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972). Additionally, Congress established inspectors general in 1978 and enacted the Congressional Review of Regulations Act to improve accountability. Congress established inspectors general in 1978 and enacted the Congressional Review of Regulations Act to improve oversight and accountability. Congress also sought to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act in 1974. To improve agencies' financial management, Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act in 1990 and other related laws. Congress passed various laws to improve oversight and accountability, including the establishment of inspectors general in 1978 and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act in 1974. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 was also enacted to enhance agencies' financial management capabilities. These legislative actions aimed to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies. The compendium's entries question whether general management laws bring disciplined management or stifle flexibility in executive branch agencies. The answer may vary based on perspective and historical context. The debate over general management laws in executive branch agencies revolves around whether they bring disciplined management or stifle flexibility. The conclusion depends on the perspective and historical context, with numerous controversial issues for Congress to consider. The debate over general management laws in executive branch agencies revolves around whether they bring disciplined management or stifle flexibility. Numerous controversial issues remain for Congress to consider, including the question of comparing management practices in the public and private sectors. Scholars and practitioners see similarities and differences between the two sectors, seeking to learn from each other while also recognizing key distinctions. Management scholars and practitioners compare public and private sectors, seeking to learn from each other while recognizing key differences. Caution is advised when applying private-sector management principles to government agencies. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre famously stated that \"public and private management are fundamentally alike in all unimportant respects.\" Public administration scholars caution against applying private-sector management principles to government agencies due to fundamental differences in laws and purposes. Public-sector agencies and private-sector companies operate under different sets of laws, with the government having coercive power under the Constitution and public law. Public-sector agencies and private-sector companies operate under different laws to regulate behaviors for different purposes. The government has coercive power under the Constitution and public law, with checks and balances to prevent arbitrary exercise of power. The government has the power to regulate private activity and collect taxes, with checks and balances in place to prevent abuse of power. Federal agencies must operate within the authority granted by public law, established by Congress, the President, and the courts. Private companies, on the other hand, operate under laws that govern a functioning market economy. Government agencies operate under laws established by Congress, the President, and the courts, while private companies operate under laws that regulate a functioning market economy. Private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders, while government agencies serve the American public. Private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders, while government agencies operate under laws established by Congress, the President, and the courts. Government agencies cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, and must serve specific goals. Government agencies differ from private sector organizations in that they cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over revenues, factors of production, and agency goals is largely external, leading agency managers to prioritize the demands of legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. Government agencies must prioritize the demands of external entities such as legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. Measuring agency performance and managing the executive branch pose challenges due to differences between public and private sector management practices. The compendium of general management laws may raise public policy issues. Government often struggles to measure and reach consensus on agency performance, especially due to differences between public and private sector management practices. The compendium of general management laws can raise public policy issues and themes that may prompt Congress to consider management policy options. The compendium of general management laws may raise public policy issues and themes for Congress to consider management policy options regarding the discretion of the executive branch in determining agency actions. The question of how much discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions has been heavily debated. Giving discretion can provide flexibility for agencies to tailor implementation of laws to specific circumstances. This flexibility allows agencies to be more responsive if circumstances change. Giving discretion to the executive branch can provide flexibility for agencies to tailor the implementation of laws to specific circumstances. This allows agencies to be more responsive if circumstances change, especially in scientific or technical judgments. Giving discretion to the executive branch allows for flexibility in implementing regulations and making decisions that may not have support from Congress. The President or agencies can act more quickly than the legislative process, especially in scientific or technical matters. This can lead to differing views on what is the \"right thing to do\" between the executive branch and Congress. Granting discretion to the executive branch allows for decisions to be made without explicit support from Congress, potentially leading to differing views on what is the \"right thing to do.\" This can result in actions being taken by the President or agencies that may not align with Congress or key stakeholders, with limited resources or time for intervention. Unelected agency officials may hold key decision-making power, raising concerns about transparency. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to decisions made without Congress's explicit support, potentially causing conflicts with key stakeholders. This can result in actions taken by the President or agencies that may not align with Congress, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Congress faced this tension in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their HRM systems. In 2002 and 2003, Congress grappled with the tension between flexibility and accountability when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their HRM systems. Similar situations have arisen in the past, such as in 1993 with the Clinton Administration's NPR recommending ways to streamline procurement policy. This tension is most common in the regulatory arena. In 1993, the Clinton Administration recommended streamlining procurement policy, leading to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. Scholars have identified four options for Congress to address delegation situations and balance flexibility with accountability in regulatory matters. In regulatory matters, Congress can address delegation situations by using contract design to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce adverse consequences. This includes setting conditions such as goals, sanctions, probation periods, pilot projects, and profit-sharing relationships. Congress can set conditions for delegation of authority to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce adverse consequences. This can include establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, pilot projects, and profit-sharing relationships to incentivize agencies to behave in ways that benefit both the agency and the government as a whole. Congress can establish profit-sharing relationships to incentivize agencies to behave in ways that benefit both the agency and the government as a whole. Screening and selection mechanisms can also be used to ensure effective performance by executive branch agencies. Congress can use screening and selection mechanisms to ensure effective performance by executive branch agencies. This can involve convening hearings to determine if the agency has the capacity and skills to do the job effectively. Monitoring and reporting requirements can also be implemented to increase accountability and transparency for a given activity or program. Congress can use screening and selection mechanisms, such as convening hearings, to ensure effective performance by executive branch agencies. Monitoring and reporting requirements can also be implemented to increase accountability and transparency for a given activity or program. This includes requiring agencies to report their actions taken, milestones reached, and obtained information. Congress can mandate agencies to report their actions, milestones, and acquired information to monitor difficult-to-oversee actions and provide access to information. The use of information technology allows for real-time and frequent updates in reporting. However, some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome and reports to Congress may not always be utilized. The advent of information technology and the Web enables real-time and frequent reporting to Congress. Some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Institutional checks, such as involving additional agencies in decision-making, can be implemented by Congress. Involving additional agencies in decision-making can provide institutional checks to veto or block actions by the delegate agency. Congress can require joint regulation promulgation, notice and comment procedures, sequential funding with conditions, independent studies, or committee vetoes to control agency actions. The tension between standardization and customization of management laws for agencies is a key consideration. Congress can involve additional agencies in decision-making to provide checks on agency actions through various mechanisms such as joint regulation promulgation, notice and comment procedures, sequential funding with conditions, independent studies, or committee vetoes. The tension between standardization and customization of management laws for agencies is a key consideration for Congress. Standardization can improve executive branch transparency and accountability. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a key consideration for Congress. Standardization can enhance executive branch transparency and accountability, as seen in laws like the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 and the CFO Act of 1990. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 aimed to establish requirements for agency rulemaking, while the CFO Act of 1990 mandated audited financial statements for executive departments and agencies, leading to improved transparency and accountability. The CFO Act of 1990 mandated audited financial statements for executive departments and agencies, leading to improved transparency and accountability. In 2002, Congress further amended the CFO Act to extend similar requirements to most other executive agencies with the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to demonstrate exceptions, while customization can aid effective management. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended requirements of the CFO Act to other executive agencies, promoting accountability through standardization. Customization can also be beneficial for effective management by aligning with internal and external environments. Congress uses various tools to direct specific actions. Customization aligns agency management with internal and external environments. Congress uses statutes and reports to direct agency actions, incorporating customization into general management laws. Congress incorporates customization into general management laws by directing specific actions for agencies, such as granting small agencies exemptions from preparing audited financial statements. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have been given authority to customize certain aspects of their HRM systems. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have been granted authority to customize certain aspects of their HRM systems, moving towards a mixed approach of balancing standardization with customization in general management laws. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) exemplifies a mixed approach in general management laws, requiring agencies to develop strategic plans while allowing for flexibility and exceptions. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required executive branch agencies to develop strategic plans, with flexibility and exceptions allowed. Standardization, customization, and mixed approaches have advantages and disadvantages in implementing laws. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required agencies to comply with a general framework for strategic plans, allowing for standardization, customization, or a mixed approach. Standardization can stifle creativity, while customization may reduce transparency and accountability if not monitored effectively. Customization can sometimes reduce transparency or accountability if agencies do not report in real-time on their efforts, leading to cross-purposes and budget pressures. Congress has policy options to avoid these problems. Congress has policy options to avoid problems that arise from agencies working at cross-purposes, such as budget pressures. The decision to use these approaches depends on various factors, including the nature of the problem and the stakeholders involved. Regular examination of increased customization is an overall option to consider. One option to address problems arising from agencies working at cross-purposes is to regularly assess the need for increased customization or standardization in general management laws for better transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources like agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and external scholars. One option to address issues with agencies working at cross-purposes is to regularly evaluate the need for increased customization or standardization in general management laws to enhance transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support can be sourced from agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and external scholars. Another approach in situations with widespread customization is to reduce the analytical burden by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs. One approach to address issues with agencies working at cross-purposes is to regularly evaluate the need for increased customization or standardization in general management laws. Analytical support can be sourced from agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and external scholars. In situations with widespread customization, reducing the analytical burden by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs can be beneficial. Maintaining updated comparisons across agencies can help in monitoring and analyzing government-wide issues. The compendium's introductory profile of Title 5 human resources laws highlights the increasing fragmentation of civil service laws, making it challenging to monitor and compare government-wide developments in areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions. Reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization could help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public. The establishment of reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization could help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public in examining government-wide developments in pay, performance management, and adverse actions. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, FMS, or others could provide real-time reporting on the Web. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and FMS could report on how management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis. This may require costs for reporting agencies. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and FMS, or others, could report on how management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons. This may involve costs for reporting agencies. General management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement, reflecting how organizations in both private and public sectors manage themselves with a functional orientation. Most organizations, in both private and public sectors, manage themselves with a functional orientation or structures, such as financial management, human resources, and procurement. A functional perspective is important for efficiency and centralized control over strategic decisions, but too much focus on internal functions can hinder organization-wide coordination. \"Taxpayer groups\" within organizations can operate as functional silos, hindering organization-wide coordination and development of general managers. \"Functional silos within organizations can hinder organization-wide coordination and inhibit the development of general managers. This can lead to missed opportunities and problems for the organization as a whole. Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives into a broader general management perspective.\" Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives into a broader general management perspective. This perspective recognizes that individuals bring different assumptions based on their backgrounds and experiences when approaching problems or decisions. Each individual's background and experiences shape their perspective when approaching problems or decisions. This can lead to a limited view of the whole story and a tendency to define problems based on one's expertise. To overcome this, it is important to develop a general management perspective that integrates various functional viewpoints. The importance of developing a general management perspective is highlighted to integrate various functional viewpoints in problem-solving and decision-making. This approach aims to provide a complete understanding of a problem or opportunity by combining different perspectives, such as using information technology to enhance human resources and financial management. The general management perspective integrates multiple functional viewpoints to understand problems or opportunities. An example is using information technology to improve human resources and financial management. This approach provides a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management issues. Many general management laws focus on enhancing management fundamentals in specific functional areas. An integrated general management perspective offers a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems by utilizing general management laws to provide mutual support to each other. An integrated general management perspective utilizes general management laws to provide mutual support in addressing executive branch management problems, including leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for information technology perspective. Integration could occur through changes to general management laws, agency authorizing statutes, and appropriations, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting using the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The Act of 2002 aims to improve financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture for real-time results. It also directs appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists to help agencies manage contracts better. The Act of 2002 focuses on improving financial and performance reporting through the Federal Enterprise Architecture. It also directs appropriations to hire contract oversight specialists for better contract management by agencies. The Act of 2002 aims to improve financial and performance reporting through the Federal Enterprise Architecture and directs appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists. Other options include restructuring budget accounts, aligning resources with programs, and developing metrics for assessing staff resources for contract management and oversight. The Act of 2002 aims to improve financial and performance reporting through the Federal Enterprise Architecture and directs appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists. Options for leveraging functional perspectives into an integrated general management perspective could include developing metrics for assessing staff resources for contract management and oversight. The history of federal government management reform includes various efforts to improve agencies' performance and management practices through functional perspectives such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, and more. The history of federal government management reform involves efforts to improve agencies' performance and management practices, including financial management, budgeting, accounting, organization, acquisition management, real property management, intergovernmental relations, human resources management, and ethics. Despite numerous attempts by both legislative and executive branches, progress has been challenging to achieve, with Congress facing difficulties in overseeing executive branch management. Despite efforts to improve agency management practices, progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management, particularly in ensuring compliance with general management laws and measuring agencies' progress. Measurement is seen as a strong motivator for action in management literature. Measurement is considered a strong motivator for action in management literature. Industrial psychologist Mason Haire's quote \"What gets measured gets done\" emphasizes the importance of measurement systems in driving organizational behavior. However, these systems can also create perverse incentives. Psychologist Mason Haire emphasizes the importance of measurement systems in driving organizational behavior. While they can motivate action and commitment, they may also create perverse incentives, such as focusing on short-term profits over long-term sustainability. Employees may prioritize short-term profits over long-term research and development if they are only rewarded based on immediate financial gains. Achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through manual workarounds instead of addressing underlying system deficiencies. Over the past 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have consistently reported significant management issues in the executive branch. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported persistent management problems in executive branch agencies, including financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and program implementation. GAO released six series of reports from 1992 to 2003 detailing these issues. The GAO released reports from 1992 to 2003 highlighting major management challenges in executive branch agencies, including financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and program implementation. Progress was noted, but significant work still remained to be done. The GAO released reports from 1992 to 2003 on major management challenges in executive branch agencies. Progress was made, but significant work remained. Management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including Reagan's Reform '88, Bush's efforts on financial management and Clinton's NPR. Members of Congress were also involved in addressing these issues. Several management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including President Ronald Reagan's Reform '88, President George H. W. Bush's efforts on financial management and information resources, and President William Clinton's NPR. Members of Congress expressed concern about government management and recommended actions to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources. Members of Congress and their committee staff expressed concern about government management. In 1992, the House Committee on Government Operations recommended actions to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources. In 2001, Senator Fred Thompson released a report highlighting urgent federal government management problems faced by the administration of President George W. Bush. In June 2001, Senator Fred Thompson released a report on urgent federal government management problems faced by the administration of President George W. Bush, including issues with the federal workforce, financial management, information technology, and overlap and duplication. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget also introduced the President's Management Agenda in August 2001, which includes five government-wide initiatives. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget introduced the President's Management Agenda in August 2001, which includes five government-wide initiatives focused on strategic management of human capital, competitive sourcing, improved financial performance, expanded electronic government, and budget and performance integration. OMB leads quarterly evaluations of agencies to assess progress with red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" based on published standards for success. Under the President's Management Agenda (PMA), OMB evaluates agencies quarterly on five initiatives: human capital, competitive sourcing, financial performance, electronic government, and budget integration. Agencies are given red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" based on standards for success. Green indicates meeting all criteria, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. According to the PMA website, agencies are evaluated quarterly on five initiatives by OMB. They are given green, yellow, or red scores based on their progress. Green means meeting all criteria, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. OMB assesses each agency on a case by case basis against established deliverables and timelines. Green progress indicates implementation is proceeding as planned, while yellow suggests some issues requiring adjustment by the agency. OMB evaluates agencies quarterly on five initiatives, assigning green, yellow, or red scores based on progress. Green indicates implementation is on track, yellow shows some issues, and red signals serious jeopardy. The initiatives fall into functional categories, with OMB assessing each agency individually against established deliverables and timelines. The OMB evaluates agencies quarterly on five initiatives, assigning green, yellow, or red scores based on progress. Red indicates serious jeopardy and the initiative is unlikely to achieve objectives without significant management intervention. The initiatives are categorized into functional categories and are meant to be mutually reinforcing. General management laws are used to achieve the PMA's goals, such as the Competitive Sourcing initiative leveraging the Federal Activities Inventory Reform. The OMB's five initiatives are meant to be mutually reinforcing and utilize general management laws to achieve the PMA's goals. For example, the Competitive Sourcing initiative leverages the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998, while the Improved Financial Performance initiative leverages multiple financial management laws. The OMB's initiatives leverage various management laws to achieve the PMA's goals, including the FAIR Act of 1998, Antideficiency Act, CFO Act of 1990, and FFMIA of 1996. The PMA is being implemented by some agencies, as reported in the news media. The Electronic Government initiative utilizes key management laws such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, E-Government Act, and FISMA. The Strategic Management of Human Capital and Budget and Performance Integration initiatives leverage the Government Performance and Results Act. Some agencies are making progress with the PMA, but there are concerns about transparency in evaluation practices outside the executive branch. The PMA is being taken seriously with significant progress, but there are concerns about transparency in evaluation practices outside the executive branch.OMB assessments using the PART tool were more transparent than PMA evaluations. The OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) were more transparent than the PMA evaluations. While the standards for success are publicly available, detailed rationales and worksheets behind these grades are not. OMB also released detailed worksheets to increase transparency in assessing agency programs. The stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity in evaluating initiatives. In the President's FY2004 budget proposal, OMB released detailed worksheets for transparency in assessing agency programs. The stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity in evaluating initiatives, such as the need for acceptable IT business cases and succession strategies for leadership talent pool. Independent evaluation organizations have not conducted assessments. To achieve green status for the Expanded Electronic Government initiative, agencies need acceptable IT business cases. Similarly, for the Strategic Management of Human Capital initiative, agencies must have succession strategies resulting in a leadership talent pool. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores. The PMA does not cover all aspects of general management laws, like contract oversight in the Competitive Sourcing initiative. The PMA does not address all management issues, such as contract oversight and small business concerns. Real property management is also not explicitly covered. Verification of agency stoplight scores has not been conducted by independent evaluation organizations. The PMA does not include contract oversight or small business contracting concerns in its criteria, despite long-standing concerns over these issues. Real property management is also not explicitly addressed. The executive branch, nongovernmental organizations, and Congress have all tried to influence agencies to improve management practices. Agency IGs and GAO have focused on specific problems, while OMB and GAO have created \"high risk\" programs for troublesome management areas. The executive branch, nongovernmental organizations, and Congress have tried to influence agencies to improve management practices by measuring compliance with general management laws. Agency IGs and GAO focus on specific problems, while OMB and GAO created \"high risk\" programs for troublesome management areas. Some, especially in Congress, have undertaken measurement efforts to assess general management laws and functional areas across agencies. Representative Stephen Horn issued letter grades to evaluate agency financial management and information security performance. Representative Adam also played a role in these efforts. Some in Congress have measured agency compliance with general management laws and specific areas. Representative Stephen Horn issued letter grades for financial management and information security. Representative Adam Putnam continued this practice for information security. Senator Fred Thompson also graded agency performance reports. Representative Adam Putnam has continued the practice of evaluating agency compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. Senator Fred Thompson also issued grades for agency annual performance reports. Congress can explore options to ensure executive branch agencies improve management practices by complying with general management laws and measure agency progress through easily understood cross-agency comparisons. Congress could use existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs to monitor executive branch agencies' progress in improving management practices. Options include maintaining current efforts and exploring ways to measure agency progress through cross-agency comparisons. Congress could continue to use existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs to monitor progress in the executive branch's efforts to improve agency management practices. Critics argue that Congress may not effectively utilize these tools. Congress could ask GAO and agency IGs to verify and validate PMA stoplight scores and agency actions, increasing confidence in executive branch measurements. Congress could increase confidence in executive branch measurements by directing GAO and agency IGs to verify and validate PMA stoplight scores and agency actions. Additionally, Congress could secure access to final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies to enhance transparency. Congress could enhance transparency by securing access to final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies. Additionally, Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures for independent measurement of agency progress in improving management practices. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures for independent measurement of agency progress in improving management practices, which could increase workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies. Improving management practices across agencies could be compared easily along functional lines or for specific general management laws. This option aims to make management improvement measurement more systematic, surviving transitions between presidential administrations, but may increase workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies. Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports, establishing milestones and timelines for improvement. Congress could potentially require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports by establishing milestones and timelines for improvement. This could be done by amending GPRA to make management improvement measurement more systematic, although it may increase workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies. Additionally, Congress could also require the President to address these issues in the government-wide performance plan. The curr_chunk discusses the potential for Congress to require agencies to address management problems and improve agency management capacity. This could involve establishing milestones and timelines for improvement and could increase workload for agency and OMB personnel. Additionally, it mentions the expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions. The curr_chunk discusses the option for Congress to make management improvement measurement statutory or more systematic, potentially increasing workload for agencies and OMB personnel. It also mentions the expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions. The curr_chunk discusses agency \"chief officer\" positions, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions head various functions within executive branch agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of agency chief officer positions, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. Key details about each officer position are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 summarizes key information about agency chief officer positions, including their functions, establishment laws, statutory provisions, appointment rules, and reporting structure. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. Certain positions require political appointees, such as CAOs and certain CFOs. The table summarizes key information about agency chief officer positions, including functions, establishment laws, appointment rules, and reporting structure. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. Certain positions require political appointees, such as CAOs and certain CFOs. Reporting relationships vary among chief officers, with some required to report directly to the agency head. Certain CFOs are required to be political appointees. Three chief officers (IGs, CFOs, and CIOs) must report directly to the agency head, while reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs are at the agency head's discretion. The creation of these positions aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives like financial management within executive branch agencies. The creation of chief officer positions aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives like financial management within executive branch agencies. Many observers believed that each functional perspective needed to be \"elevated\" to a higher position within agencies' management ranks to ensure long-standing problems would be addressed. Each group of chief officers was placed into an interagency council by statute or executive order. Observers believed that elevating each functional perspective within agencies' management ranks would address long-standing problems. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order, with key information summarized in Table 2 on the next page. The text chunk summarizes key information about various councils, including membership, chairperson, statutory provisions, establishment, and website. Four councils were established by law, while two exist through executive order. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to direct them. The councils vary in membership and establishment, with four established by law and two by executive order. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to direct their activities. President Reagan established the first council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, in 1981 through executive order. President Reagan established the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) in 1981 through executive order to coordinate government-wide activities against fraud and waste. The PCIE became a source of leverage for agency Inspectors General (IGs) to fight for resources and independence. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, served as a tool for enhancing the lobbying power of agency Inspectors General (IGs) and building informal networks to support organizational learning. IGs found benefits in sharing ideas and cooperating on projects through standing committees established by the PCIE. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, enhanced the lobbying power of agency Inspectors General (IGs) and facilitated the building of informal networks to support organizational learning. Standing committees were established by the PCIE for IGs to share ideas and cooperate on projects, leading to positive feedback from IGs about the unique mechanism it provided for collaboration across government agencies. In 1988, the PCIE was praised for promoting collaboration among agency Inspectors General, allowing them to work together on fraud, waste, and abuse issues. However, it was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, including the PCIE. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) for IGs typically appointed by agency heads. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council was also created by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The PCIE and ECIE were established for IGs, while the CFO Council was created by the CFO Act of 1990, which also established the DDM position in the President's Office of Management and Budget. The DDM oversees the CFO Council and is responsible for setting general management policies in the executive branch. The CFO Act established the DDM position in the President's Office of Management and Budget, giving them oversight of the CFO Council and responsibility for setting general management policies in the executive branch. The CFO Council was initially passive but became more active in 1994 by broadening its membership. The CFO Council, established under the CFO Act, oversees financial management, procurement policy, information and statistical policy, property management, human resources management, and program evaluation. In 1994, the council became more active by broadening membership, electing officers, and setting its agenda independently of OMB. Similar to the PCIE, the CFO Council formed committees for special emphasis areas. The CFO Council, established under the CFO Act, broadened its membership to include career deputy CFO positions, elected council officers, and set its agenda independently of OMB. OMB supported the recommendations, and the council formed committees for special emphasis areas. The commentator noted that OMB's deputy director for management has leveraging opportunities through interagency councils like the CFO Council, which can serve as a model for other interagency efforts. The commentator highlighted the leveraging opportunities of OMB's deputy director for management through interagency councils like the CFO Council, which can serve as a model for other interagency efforts. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has been met with little criticism and are considered important by long-time observers. The establishment of additional chief officer councils by Congress, including the CIO Council in 2002, the CHCO Council in 2002, and the CAO Council in 2003, has been generally successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives. However, challenges such as high turnover among CIOs have been identified by observers. Observers have identified challenges facing chief officers in improving agency management practices, including high turnover among CIOs, difficulties with change management, and performance measurement. Agencies still face persistent management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Some challenges facing chief officers in improving agency management practices include high turnover among CIOs, change management difficulties, and performance measurement. Agencies continue to struggle with management issues due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Management scholars caution against functional silos that hinder a more integrated general management perspective. The lack of attention from political appointees has diminished agencies' management and analytical capabilities. Management scholars warn against functional silos that hinder a more integrated general management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have been noted for periods of effectiveness, with observers generally agreeing on their benefits. Public management scholars are increasingly focusing on the advantages of interagency collaboration. Interagency councils of chief officers have been noted for periods of effectiveness, with observers generally agreeing on their benefits. Public management scholars are increasingly focusing on the advantages of interagency collaboration, as highlighted in Congress testimony regarding the importance of setting up networks for sharing. The compendium's entry for Chapter 14 of Title 5, United States Code highlights the importance of Chief Human Capital Officers Council in improving federal management through sharing knowledge and best practices among different human capital officers in the Federal Government. Setting up networks of people to share knowledge, best practices, and information is crucial for organizational performance. Regular meetings among human capital officers in different parts of the Federal Government can be valuable. The management literature emphasizes the importance of knowledge management, but warns against solely focusing on one function to address agencies' problems. The management literature emphasizes the importance of knowledge management and the need to avoid solely focusing on one function to address agencies' problems. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the Federal Government to improve management. Some scholars and practitioners argue for avoiding a narrow functional perspective in federal executive branch management. They suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President, including questions about chief officers and interagency councils. The focus is on improving management by considering the need for additional chief officers, evaluating the current number of chief officers, and preserving institutional memory and continuity. The focus is on improving federal executive branch management by re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President, including questions about chief officers and interagency councils. Congress may consider the need for additional chief officers, evaluating the current number, and preserving institutional memory and continuity. Options for chief security officers and funding for councils are briefly outlined. The need for chief security officers (CSOs) in federal agencies is highlighted due to the increasing security risks. Congress is urged to consider establishing CSOs to ensure government services are available in emergencies. In the wake of security risks, should Congress establish agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) to ensure government services are available in emergencies? Many CSOs focus on information technology and report to the company CIO, but in large enterprises, the CSO may handle all security responsibilities. According to a 2002 news report, many corporate CEOs have designated CSOs, with some focusing solely on information technology. CSOs may handle all security responsibilities in large enterprises, potentially leading to turf battles with CIOs. Establishing statutory CSO positions could bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management in federal agencies. Establishing statutory CSO positions in federal agencies could lead to turf battles with CIOs but may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management. Some argue that requiring an additional chief officer would be excessive. Observers note that agencies often do not adequately evaluate their programs. Some observers suggest that agencies lack proper program evaluation due to various reasons. Congress could create \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies to address this issue. Program evaluation in agencies is often inadequate due to lack of capacity, management attention, or resources. Congress could establish \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies to address this issue and improve evaluation efforts. This could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams, helping agency efforts to improve performance or coordinate programs with overlapping missions. Critics may argue that establishing another type of chief officer would be excessive. If Congress decided to alter existing chief officer positions or establish new ones, it would have a number of options regarding appointments. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Critics may argue that establishing another type of chief officer would be excessive. If Congress decided to alter existing chief officer positions or establish new ones, it would have options regarding appointments. Table 1 outlines the appointment options for chief officers under current law, with some positions required to be political, others career, and some at the agency head's discretion. Recent discussions have debated the benefits of political appointees having a \"seat at the table\" for functional perspectives, while career officials offer continuity across administrations. In congressional testimony, witnesses debated the benefits of political appointees versus career officials for CHCO and CAO positions. Congress reflected both perspectives in the CFO Act, with CFOs being political and deputies being career. Reporting relationships mandate CFOs and CIOs to report directly to the agency head. The CFO Act mandates CFOs and CIOs to report directly to the agency head, while CHCOs and CAOs reporting relationships are at the agency head's discretion. The appropriateness of these reporting relationships in addressing management problems is being questioned. The reporting relationships of CHCOs and CAOs are left to each agency head's discretion, unlike CFOs and CIOs who must report directly to the agency head. The appropriateness of these reporting relationships in addressing management problems is being questioned. One argument for a direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to ensure the chief officer's personal access to senior leadership. However, adding another direct report could overwhelm agency heads with too many subordinates. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory to enhance oversight. The possibility of making IG councils statutory by codifying the mandates of the PCIE and ECIE into law is being considered by Congress. This could require modest appropriations but would improve training and strengthen oversight. The possibility of making IG councils statutory by codifying the mandates of the PCIE and ECIE into law is being considered by Congress. This change could require modest appropriations but would improve training, strengthen oversight, and enhance coordination between IG offices in the federal government. Some may argue that this change could reduce flexibility or control by the President. More details on this subject can be found in the compendium's profile of the Inspector General Act of 1978. Funding for interagency councils is also discussed. The possibility of making IG councils statutory by codifying the mandates of the PCIE and ECIE into law is being considered by Congress. This change could require modest appropriations but would improve training, oversight, and coordination between IG offices in the federal government. Funding for interagency councils is also discussed, with the IG councils self-financing their activities via MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. Funding for interagency councils: Congress has options for funding the IG councils (PCIE and ECIE) through MOUs, while the CHCO Council is funded by the Office of Personnel Management. The IG councils are funded differently, with one office paying for the website and another two offices paying for the annual report. The CHCO Council is funded by the Office of Personnel Management, while the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council are funded through interagency transfer or reimbursement. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils have been funded through interagency transfer or reimbursement in recent years. Congress could maintain the current funding structure or consider making a separate appropriation for each council individually or combined. This option could limit some discretion from the Office of Management and Budget. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning for the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils to potentially improve institutional memory and continuity across presidential administrations. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to enhance control, leverage, and institutional memory across presidential administrations. Altering reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils could enhance control and institutional memory across presidential administrations. Some councils currently lack these requirements, such as the PCIE and ECIE reporting only to the President. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils also lack statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans, which could be addressed by requiring submission of plans or reports to the President or Congress. Congress could also consider mandating OMB to submit an overall leadership plan. The PCIE and ECIE report only to the President, while the CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could mandate submission of plans or reports to increase transparency and accountability. Planning and reporting requirements could enhance control and institutional memory. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must submit a plan for leading interagency chief officer councils as part of the government-wide performance plan required by GPRA. This could increase transparency and accountability to Congress, but may limit the President's discretion and raise costs for the councils or OMB."
