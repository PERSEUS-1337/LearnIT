Time series clustering faces difficulties due to variations in properties and features across different domains. There is a gap in technology for accurate unsupervised learning of time series data in various fields like financial trading and medical monitoring. The problem of unsupervised time series clustering is challenging due to variations in properties and features across different domains. Time series data often have temporal gaps and high frequency noise, making standard clustering techniques ineffective. The text discusses the challenges of using standard clustering techniques on time series data due to temporal gaps and high frequency noise.

The novel algorithm, deep temporal clustering (DTC), transforms time series data into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network integrated with a temporal clustering layer. The DTC algorithm aims to uncover latent dimensions in the data manifolds to split temporal or spatio-temporal unlabeled data. The proposed DTC algorithm utilizes a three-level approach to disentangle data manifolds, with a CNN at the first level reducing data dimensionality and learning short-time-scale waveforms, and a BI-LSTM at the second level learning temporal connections across all time. The proposed three-level approach utilizes a CNN to reduce data dimensionality and learn short-time-scale waveforms, a BI-LSTM to learn temporal connections across all time scales, and non-parametric clustering to find spatio-temporal dimensions for data classification. This approach untangles data manifolds without losing time course information.

This is the first work to apply deep learning in temporal clustering, offering an end-to-end solution. The study introduces a novel deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on explaining informative data features for class assignment. It is the first work in this area and emphasizes the importance of an effective latent representation and similarity metric for accurate clustering.

Existing research in temporal clustering methods has focused on dimensionality reduction and similarity metrics. One class of solutions uses application-dependent dimensionality reduction to filter out high-frequency noise, but this approach may result in the loss of long-range temporal correlations and relevant features. One drawback of some dimensionality reduction methods is the potential loss of long-range temporal correlations and relevant features. These approaches are hand-crafted and application-specific, requiring extensive domain knowledge. Another class of solutions focuses on creating a suitable similarity measure between time series by considering features like complexity and correlation. Some limitations of dimensionality reduction methods include the hand-crafted and application-specific nature of transformations, requiring extensive domain knowledge. Another approach involves creating a similarity measure between time series based on features like complexity and correlation, which can impact clustering results significantly. BID14 studied various similarity metrics like complexity and correlation for time series clustering, showing their significant impact on results. However, a good similarity measure alone may not be enough without proper dimensionality reduction due to the complexity of time series data. Casting data into a low dimensional latent space has been effective for temporal clustering. Recent research has shown that while a good similarity measure is important for clustering time series data, proper dimensionality reduction is also crucial for optimal results. Casting the data into a low dimensional latent space has been effective for temporal clustering, but there is a need for a general methodology to select an effective latent space. Compatibility between the similarity metric and temporal feature space is also essential for meaningful clustering results. Recent research has highlighted the importance of proper dimensionality reduction and a suitable similarity metric for clustering time series data. While approaches for static data have shown superior performance, they are not well-suited for temporal clustering. The goal is to find an effective latent space for temporal sequence data clustering. The proposed DTC method combines a stacked autoencoder and k-means for clustering static data, but is not suitable for time series data. The goal is to cluster unlabeled temporal sequences into k clusters based on high-level features. The approach involves encoding the input signal with a convolutional autoencoder and BI-LSTM. The proposed DTC method aims to cluster unlabeled temporal sequences into k clusters using a convolutional autoencoder and BI-LSTM. The latent representation from BI-LSTM is used for temporal clustering, with a focus on effective latent representation for clustering. The proposed DTC method utilizes a temporal autoencoder (TAE) and BI-LSTM for clustering unlabeled temporal sequences. The TAE generates cluster assignments using the latent representation from BI-LSTM, emphasizing effective representation for clustering. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer, max pooling layer, and L-ReLUs for compactly representing time series data. The network architecture utilizes a temporal autoencoder (TAE) with a 1D convolution layer and max pooling to extract key features from time series data. Leaky rectifying linear units (L-ReLUs) are used for dimensionality reduction before feeding the activations to a Bidirectional LSTM for learning temporal changes in both directions. The network architecture uses a temporal autoencoder with 1D convolution and max pooling for feature extraction from time series data. Bidirectional LSTM is then employed to learn temporal changes in both directions, followed by a clustering layer to assign latent representations to clusters. Learning in both 1D CNN and BI-LSTM is driven by interleaved minimization of two cost functions. The network architecture utilizes a temporal autoencoder with 1D convolution and max pooling for feature extraction from time series data. Bidirectional LSTM captures temporal changes, and a clustering layer assigns latent representations to clusters.

Bidirectional LSTM captures temporal changes, and a clustering layer assigns latent representations to clusters. Minimization of two cost functions ensures well-represented sequences and distinct spatio-temporal behavior in clusters. The network architecture utilizes a temporal autoencoder with 1D convolution and max pooling for feature extraction from time series data. The second cost function is provided by the clustering metric of level 3, ensuring high-level features separate sequences into distinct clusters with unique spatio-temporal behavior. The clustering metric optimization modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to disentangle the spatio-temporal manifolds of the dynamics. The network optimizes weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to extract spatio-temporal features that separate input sequences into clusters, disentangling high-dimensional manifolds of dynamics efficiently. This contrasts traditional approaches like dimensionality reduction. The network efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features to separate input sequences into clusters, improving unsupervised categorization compared to traditional approaches. The traditional approaches of dimensionality reduction and clustering separately optimize reconstruction and separation, leading to suboptimal results. End-to-end optimization shows significant improvement in unsupervised categorization compared to disjoint optimization methods. Directly applying clustering algorithms to spatio-temporal data without initial dimensionality reduction often leads to overfitting and poor performance. Our approach emphasizes effective end-to-end optimization and utilizes the temporal continuity of spatio-temporal data to extract informative features in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer consists of k centroids w j , j \u2208 1..k. The approach utilizes temporal continuity of spatio-temporal data to extract informative features in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer consists of k centroids w j , j \u2208 1..k, initialized using latent signals z i obtained from the input x i through the TAE. Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage in feature space Z is performed to obtain clusters, followed by averaging the elements in each cluster. The centroids w j , j \u2208 1..k are initialized using latent signals z i from input x i through the TAE. Hierarchical clustering in feature space Z is performed to obtain clusters, followed by averaging elements in each cluster to get initial centroid estimates w j , j = 1...k. The initial centroids estimates w j , j = 1...k are obtained by averaging elements in each cluster. The temporal clustering layer is trained using an unsupervised algorithm that alternates between computing the probability of assignment of input x i to cluster j based on the closeness of latent representation z i to centroid w j, and updating centroids using a loss function to maximize high confidence assignments. The temporal clustering layer assigns input data to clusters based on the proximity of their latent representations to cluster centroids.

The parameter \u03b1 represents the degrees of freedom of the Students t distribution, and siml() is the temporal similarity metric used to compute distances between the encoded signal and centroids. siml() is a temporal similarity metric used to compute distances between encoded signals and centroids. A 2 cluster example is illustrated in FIG0, where distances d1 and d2 from centroids w1 and w2 are computed using a similarity metric. Various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2, which computes similarity based on the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation. In this study, various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2. CID computes similarity based on euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation. The distance calculation involves a complexity factor defined as the minimum of complexity estimates of two time series x and y. The core idea of CID is that as complexity differences between series increase, the distance also increases. If both input sequences have the same complexity, the distance is simply the euclidean. The Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) metric calculates similarity based on complexity differences between time series x and y. The distance increases with complexity differences, and if both sequences have the same complexity, the distance is the euclidean distance. Additionally, the Correlation based Similarity (COR) metric computes similarities using the pearsons correlation between latent representation z i and centroids w j. The complexity of each sequence is defined as DISPLAYFORM3 where N is length of the sequence. Correlation based Similarity (COR) computes similarities using the estimated pearsons correlation \u03c1 between the latent representation z i and the centroids w j. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) computes the similarity between the latent representation z i and the centroids w j using autocorrelation coefficients. To compute the COR, pearson's correlation \u03c1 is used to measure the similarity between latent representation z i and centroids w j. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) in BID7 calculates similarity using autocorrelation coefficients and weighted euclidean distance. The objective in training the temporal clustering layer is to minimize KL divergence loss between q ij and target distribution p ij to strengthen high confidence predictions. The choice of p is crucial for normalization.
