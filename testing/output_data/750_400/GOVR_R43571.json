One key difference between debt relief programs is the potential federal income tax liability that may arise from receiving the benefit. Typically, debt forgiven under an employment-focused loan forgiveness program is not included in a borrower's gross income for federal tax purposes. The types of debt relief programs vary in terms of federal income tax liability. Debt forgiven under employment-focused loan forgiveness programs is usually tax-exempt, while debt forgiven under income-driven repayment or public service employment may be taxable.

Student loan debt forgiveness or repayment on behalf of a borrower is usually considered part of their gross income for federal income taxation, but there are exceptions where it may be excluded from income tax liability. Some federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may exempt borrowers from liability for unearned benefits in cases of disability or death. Student loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income and exempt from income tax liability under certain conditions. Loan forgiveness under specific programs or meeting conditions in IRC Section 108(f) can result in exclusion from gross income. The Higher Education Act (HEA) specifies that forgiven Federal Perkins Loans are excluded from gross income for taxation purposes. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits can be excluded from gross income if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met, such as loans being borrowed for education and containing terms for cancellation based on work in specific professions or occupations. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits can be excluded from gross income if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. Loans must have been borrowed for education and contain terms for cancellation based on work in specific professions or occupations. The loans must have been made by specified types of lenders, including the federal and state governments. Additionally, exclusions are provided for programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs eligible under the Public Health Service Act. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits can be excluded from income if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. Loans must have been borrowed for education and made by specified lenders. Exclusions are provided for programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs eligible under the Public Health Service Act. If requirements are not met, individuals are responsible for paying income tax on the benefits received. Individuals may be liable for income tax on loan forgiveness or repayment benefits if certain conditions are not met. Some programs offer supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Recipients can avoid significant taxation by excluding benefits from gross income. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated $200 million in revenue related to this issue. Researchers debate the effectiveness of providing loan repayment or forgiveness benefits to encourage borrowers to enter specific fields or geographic areas. Approximately $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion of income from student loan debt forgiveness and repayment benefits. Researchers debate the effectiveness of loan repayment or forgiveness benefits in encouraging borrowers to enter specific fields or areas. Approximately $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion of income from student loan debt forgiveness and repayment. The effectiveness of loan repayment or forgiveness benefits in encouraging individuals to enter specific fields or government service is debated. Key issues include whether individuals would enter or remain in these fields without loan forgiveness, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief encourages students to take on more loans for education expenses. The debate surrounding the effectiveness of loan repayment or forgiveness benefits in incentivizing individuals to enter specific fields or government service also considers the impact of debt relief on student loan decisions and the cost-benefit analysis for the federal government. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing individuals' employment choices and the cost to the federal government are key considerations. The analysis discusses the impact on individuals and the costs incurred by the government in operating these programs. One aspect to consider is whether recipients would have engaged in qualifying service without the program. The discussion focuses on the costs incurred by the federal government in operating loan forgiveness and repayment programs. It considers whether recipients would have engaged in qualifying service without the program, and suggests comparing the career paths of individuals with access to these benefits to those without access. The discussion considers the costs of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs and suggests comparing the career paths of individuals with access to these benefits to those without access. Data from the National Institutes of Health shows the impact of loan repayment on career trajectories. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to encourage medical research careers. Recipients were more likely to continue conducting research at the NIH. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage medical research careers, with recipients more likely to continue research at the NIH or pursue a career as a medical researcher elsewhere. This suggests the program is meeting its goals. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage medical research careers, with recipients more likely to continue research at the NIH or pursue a career as a medical researcher elsewhere. This study suggests that the program may be meeting its goals, although other factors may also influence individuals' career choices. The loan repayment program at NIH aims to encourage medical research careers, but other factors may also influence individuals' career choices. Some individuals may have entered certain fields or taken positions even without the program, potentially making it ineffective in some cases. The loan repayment program at NIH aims to encourage medical research careers, but its effectiveness may vary. For example, in recent years, law school graduates facing limited job opportunities may choose public interest or government jobs regardless of loan repayment benefits. Some individuals may have taken the same job even without loan repayment incentives. In recent years, law school graduates have fewer job opportunities, leading some to choose public interest or government jobs regardless of loan repayment benefits. While some individuals may have taken the same job without loan repayment incentives, evidence shows that in certain cases, participants would not have accepted a position without loan repayment programs. For example, healthcare providers in rural areas would still practice there even without a loan repayment award. The study found that healthcare providers in rural areas would have practiced there even without a loan repayment award. However, in some cases, loan forgiveness or repayment programs can be crucial as they may incentivize participants to take a position they would not have otherwise accepted. For instance, the NIH's loan repayment program was a deciding factor for physicians who had competing job offers at higher salaries. The NIH's loan repayment program was found to be a crucial factor for physicians with competing job offers at higher salaries, leading to increased retention in research at the NIH. Loan repayment programs are effective recruitment and retention tools for federal agencies. Loan repayment benefits for physicians at the NIH have been shown to increase retention in research. Federal agencies use loan repayment programs as effective recruitment and retention tools, but funding uncertainties may undermine their effectiveness. Loan repayment programs may face funding uncertainties that undermine their effectiveness as recruitment and retention tools. Uncertainty in funding can make loan repayment benefits uncertain for individuals, affecting recruitment incentives. Additionally, the amount of loan repayment awards may not be sufficient to attract and retain individuals in certain professions. Loan repayment programs may be more successful in meeting recruitment and retention needs if financial uncertainties are addressed. Loan repayment programs may not provide a sufficient incentive for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Researchers suggest that these programs need to offer meaningful financial benefits to offset the costs of borrowing for education. Additionally, program design elements, such as an individual's responsibility to pay federal loans, can impact the perceived value of loan repayment benefits. Loan repayment programs need to offer significant financial benefits to attract and retain individuals in certain professions. Program design elements, like the responsibility to pay federal income taxes on loan repayment benefits, can affect the perceived value of the benefits. For example, under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program (GESLRP), participants are responsible for the tax liability, which can be as high as 39% of the repayment amount. The tax liability associated with receiving a loan payment under programs like the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program (GESLRP) may make the benefits less attractive for participants. Some agencies estimate that taxes can account for 39% of the repayment amount, leading to concerns about the program's appeal and potential turnover due to short-term commitments. Some agencies suggest that taxation of loan repayment benefits makes programs less attractive to participants. Short-term commitments in exchange for benefits may lead to turnover and a less stable workforce for employers. Individuals with service obligations tend to have shorter job tenures compared to those without obligations. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may lead to turnover as individuals realize the benefits and change jobs, resulting in a less stable workforce for employers. There is a concern about whether individuals would enter a field or take a job solely because of student loan debt, which is the premise of these programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are based on the assumption that student loan debt influences career choices. However, research shows that debt may not always be a significant factor in job decisions, as other deterrents can also impact career paths. Researchers have found that career choices are complex, with debt not always influencing job decisions. Other deterrents, such as lower compensation and geographic factors, can also impact student interest in specific fields or areas. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians who enter primary care in certain locations. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) provides loan repayment benefits to physicians entering primary care in specific areas. Physicians may choose not to enter primary care due to lower compensation, preference for specialty focus, or reluctance to take on increased administrative duties. Debt levels may also influence career decisions for certain racial and ethnic groups. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available for individuals who may not enter primary care due to reasons such as focusing on a specialty or avoiding administrative duties. Debt levels can also impact career decisions for certain racial and ethnic groups. These programs provide a financial incentive for individuals to enter specific fields. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide a financial inducement for individuals to enter lower-paying fields like primary care medicine. However, the amount received is generally far less than the overall lifetime earnings gap between primary care and specialty physicians, which can amount to $3.5 million over a lifetime. One study estimated that over a lifetime, the average primary care physician earns $3.5 million less than a specialty physician, impacting job choice due to high levels of debt. High levels of student loan debt can influence job choice, leading recent graduates to pursue higher-paying jobs to repay debts. This is evident in various fields such as law and undergraduate studies, where debt levels impact career decisions towards higher salary positions. Law school debt and undergraduate debt levels can influence career choices, leading individuals to opt for higher-paying jobs in the private sector over lower-paying positions in education, government, or non-profit organizations. Some studies suggest that debt levels may play a secondary role in career decisions, alongside demographic characteristics. Some studies suggest that law school debt levels may not significantly impact career choices, with demographic characteristics playing a more dominant role in decision-making. Loan repayment programs may have little to no effect on the career paths of law school graduates. The prospect of debt relief through loan repayment or forgiveness programs may influence students to finance more of their postsecondary education expenses with student loans. The issue of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs is whether they encourage students to take on more debt for their education. These programs provide debt relief after borrowers make capped payments based on income. The issue of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs revolves around income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). These programs cap monthly payments based on income and offer debt relief after a certain period, potentially forgiving the entire outstanding balance. Monthly payments tied to income, not amount owed, may lead to forgiveness of entire outstanding balance after meeting certain conditions. Payments limited to a portion of discretionary income, potentially encouraging student over-borrowing and reducing sensitivity to education costs. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may make the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers, potentially leading to over-borrowing. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for borrowers result in costs to the federal government. The PSLF program allows individuals to receive forgiveness benefits by repaying loans under an IDR plan for 10 years while working in public service, resulting in costs to the federal government. These costs depend on the program structure and can include loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. The costs incurred by the government for loan forgiveness and repayment programs depend on the program structure. There are three categories of costs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal credit programs like the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Loan forgiveness programs are benefits included in federal student loan programs, classified as federal credit programs. These programs consist of federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees, with subsidy costs funded through mandatory appropriations. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires measuring the budgetary costs of these programs. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is a direct loan program, while the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program. Loan subsidy costs for these programs are funded through mandatory appropriations. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires measuring the budgetary costs of direct loans and loan guarantees based on their estimated long-term costs to the government. The budgetary costs of direct loans and loan guarantees are measured based on their estimated long-term costs to the government. This includes the subsidy cost of loans and administrative expenses. The federal budget reflects the costs of providing loans through subsidy costs and administrative expenses. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive cost indicates a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns from providing the loan subsidy. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost indicates the government earns from providing the loan subsidy. Loan forgiveness benefits increase loan subsidy costs. Loan forgiveness benefits increase loan subsidy costs by altering expected cash flows of the program. For example, in the Direct Loan program, Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers discharges a portion of qualified borrowers' loan balance, relieving them of debt. Loan forgiveness benefits in programs like the Direct Loan program, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers, discharge a portion of qualified borrowers' loan balance, reducing their debt. This results in increased loan subsidy costs as the government's cash flows associated with these loans are reduced. Loan forgiveness benefits in programs like the Direct Loan program relieve borrowers of repaying some loan amount, leading to increased loan subsidy costs for the government. These costs are accounted for in the fiscal year when the loan was originally made. Other examples include the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and loan forgiveness after completing the maximum repayment period in income-based repayment (IBR). The cost of loan forgiveness benefits is included in loan subsidy costs for the fiscal year when the loan was issued. Programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and forgiveness after the maximum repayment period in income-based repayment plans are funded separately from federal credit programs. The costs of borrower benefits in loan repayment programs are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year when benefits are available. Funding can be from discretionary or mandatory appropriations, and benefits are only available in years with appropriations. The loan repayment benefits are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year, which can be discretionary or mandatory. Benefits are available only in years with appropriations, and funding may not be sufficient to extend benefits to all eligible borrowers. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment (GESLR) program. Funding for loan repayment programs is limited by the availability of funds, with examples of discretionary programs like GESLR and mandatory programs like NHSCLRP. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits have a unique funding structure. The Perkins Loan Cancellation program provides unique funding for loan forgiveness, unlike other federal credit programs like GESLR and NHSCLRP. Borrowers who meet eligibility criteria are granted loan forgiveness by the institution that issued the Perkins Loan. The Perkins Loan Cancellation program offers loan forgiveness to eligible borrowers through discretionary appropriations, separate from federal credit programs like GESLR and NHSCLRP. Funding for loan cancellations was last appropriated in FY2009, but qualified borrowers continue to have their loans canceled. The Perkins Loan program is not a federal credit program, and funding for loan cancellation reimbursements has not been appropriated since FY2009. Despite this, qualified borrowers have still had their loans canceled. Institutions have absorbed the costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the federal government. Institutions have absorbed costs of canceling Perkins Loans for eligible borrowers without federal reimbursement. ED maintains records of potential reimbursement amounts if funding is appropriated. Loan forgiveness and repayment costs are typically covered through loan subsidy rates or annual appropriations. The institutions have absorbed costs of canceling Perkins Loans without federal reimbursement. ED maintains records of potential reimbursement amounts if funding is appropriated for loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are funded separately through annual appropriations. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately through annual appropriations. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are accounted for separately on a cash basis. Loan repayment programs are administered by various agencies with different funding mechanisms for administrative costs. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government. Loan repayment programs are funded through annual appropriations, with varying mechanisms for administrative costs. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of loan forgiveness and repayment programs, with some programs only having estimates of future forgiveness amounts. The government has limited information on the actual costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Estimates are available for future forgiveness amounts, while some programs have data on benefits provided in a fiscal year. The government has limited information on the costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs, with estimates available for future forgiveness amounts and some data on benefits provided in a fiscal year. Data on debt relief and recipients for specific programs are presented in an appendix. In a limited set of programs, data on debt relief and recipients is presented on a program-by-program basis. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated government costs were $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion associated with loans made prior to FY2008. In implementing changes from the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, the estimated cost to the government over FY2008-FY2012 was $1.5 billion, with $1.2 billion linked to loans issued before FY2008. Loan forgiveness benefits were not quantified, but for the REPAYE repayment plan, approximately 6 million borrowers from 1994 to 2025 are expected to benefit. In the 2015 Final Regulation, the Department of Education estimated that approximately 6 million borrowers from 1994 to 2025 will be eligible for the REPAYE repayment plan, with an estimated cost of $15.4 billion. Additionally, for the PAYE repayment plan, a cost of $2.1 billion over a 10-year period was estimated in a 2012 NPRM. Approximately 2 million borrowers are estimated to enroll in the REPAYE plan, costing $15.4 billion. The PAYE plan was estimated to cost $2.1 billion over 10 years, with approximately 1.67 million borrowers opting for it, leading to loan forgiveness for around 400,000 borrowers. The Education Department estimated that around 400,000 borrowers would receive loan forgiveness under the PAYE plan, with an average original loan balance of $39,500. These borrowers would have an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven due to paying only interest and no principal. The Education Department estimated that around 400,000 borrowers would receive loan forgiveness under the PAYE plan, with an average original loan balance of $39,500. Many borrowers would pay only interest and no principal, resulting in an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven. Additionally, approximately 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would elect to repay their loans according to the IBR plan, but specific forgiveness benefits were not provided. In the 2012 NPRM, the Education Department estimated that 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would choose to repay their loans through the IBR plan, without specifying forgiveness benefits. For pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers, it was estimated that 126,000 from the FY2009 cohort would use IBR, with 44,000 potentially having some loan forgiveness after 25 years. For the FY2012 cohort, 146,000 borrowers were estimated to repay under IBR, with 52,000 potentially receiving forgiveness. In 2008, the Education Department estimated that 126,000 borrowers from the FY2009 cohort would repay their loans through IBR, with 44,000 potentially having some debt forgiven after 25 years. For the FY2012 cohort, 146,000 borrowers were estimated to use IBR, with 52,000 potentially receiving forgiveness. Loan forgiveness benefits are new and dependent on borrower repayment behavior and labor market experiences, making precise estimates difficult. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, considering the challenges in estimating forgiveness benefits due to borrower behavior and labor market factors. Various issues related to loan forgiveness and repayment policies could be examined, such as the optimization of existing programs and potential changes to improve outcomes. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, considering challenges in estimating forgiveness benefits. Issues such as the optimization of existing programs and potential changes to improve outcomes should be examined. Multiple programs offering loan forgiveness or repayment benefits for similar activities, the structure of programs leading to financial windfalls, and the availability of debt relief are key areas for exploration. Multiple programs offering loan forgiveness or repayment benefits for similar activities should be evaluated for effectiveness. The structure of programs leading to financial windfalls for borrowers engaging in the same activities even without debt relief should be assessed. Additionally, the availability of sufficient information to determine if existing programs are achieving their intended purposes is crucial. Programs may overlap if they have the same or substantially similar goals and activities. The effectiveness of multiple loan forgiveness or repayment programs should be evaluated to avoid financial windfalls for borrowers. Overlapping programs may result in unnecessary administrative costs if they serve the same purpose for the same group of individuals. Multiple loan forgiveness or repayment programs may overlap, leading to potential financial windfalls for borrowers. This could result in unnecessary administrative costs if multiple programs serve the same purpose for the same group of individuals. Individuals may qualify for benefits under multiple programs, with some programs having restrictions on receiving benefits from other programs for the same service. Individuals may qualify for benefits under multiple loan forgiveness or repayment programs, with some programs having restrictions on receiving benefits from other programs for the same service. Recipients could potentially receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed, leading to potential financial windfalls. For example, an individual working in a federal agency may be eligible for up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program. Individuals may be eligible for benefits from multiple loan forgiveness or repayment programs, some with restrictions. Recipients could receive benefits from different sources for the same service, leading to potential financial windfalls. For example, a federal agency worker may qualify for up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program, while also being eligible for forgiveness of the remaining student loan debt after 10 years of service and 120 monthly payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Individuals may receive benefits from multiple loan forgiveness or repayment programs, potentially leading to financial windfalls. Overlapping programs can result in individuals receiving benefits from two programs for the same federal government service, creating potential administrative costs for the government. If an individual makes 120 monthly payments for loan forgiveness under the PSLF, they may receive benefits from two programs for the same government service. Overlapping programs can lead to administrative costs for the government. For example, the NELRP offers repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited schools, while the NFLRP is available to nurse faculty as well. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and the Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase qualified nursing faculty by providing repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited schools. Both programs are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Under the NFLRP, HRSA grants money to nursing schools for loan repayment. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) grants money to nursing schools for loan repayment to increase qualified nursing faculty. This may create an administrative burden on the HRSA as it administers both the NELRP and NFLRP for the same group of individuals. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs may be creating an administrative burden on the HRSA if they grant money to the Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) and also administer the Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) for the same group of individuals. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that offer double benefits or serve the same purpose. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that offer double benefits or serve the same purpose, such as loan forgiveness and repayment programs intended to encourage individuals to enter specified fields. Some programs offer benefits to encourage individuals to enter specific fields, but they may also benefit those who would have entered the field regardless. Loan forgiveness programs like the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program have no limits on forgiveness amounts. Some loan forgiveness programs, such as the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, have no limits on forgiveness amounts, which may lead individuals to borrow larger amounts than they otherwise would, especially under non-need-based PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Some concerns have been raised about income-driven repayment plans and the possibility of individuals borrowing larger amounts under non-need-based PLUS Loans, leading to questions about establishing limits on loan forgiveness amounts. Research suggests that individuals may choose certain fields or positions even without loan forgiveness incentives. Some individuals may choose certain fields or positions even without loan forgiveness incentives, raising concerns about establishing limits on forgiveness amounts. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may be ineffective if the goal is to immediately place individuals in specified occupations, but somewhat effective if the goal is to create career pipelines or retain skilled employees. Reports suggest that these programs play a role in individuals' decisions to stay in a job or career. Tailoring programs to specific needs is recommended. Loan repayment programs may be somewhat effective in retaining skilled employees and creating career pipelines. Congress could consider implementing more specific funding controls to tailor the programs to individual needs. Congress may consider implementing more specific funding controls for loan repayment programs to tailor them to individual needs, such as defining eligibility criteria more narrowly or directing fund usage through appropriations measures. Insufficient data are available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. Congress could direct fund usage through appropriations measures for loan repayment programs. Limited data are available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. Programmatic data is scarce, especially for programs where benefits are not yet awarded. Limited programmatic data is available for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, especially for those where benefits have not yet been awarded. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments before becoming eligible for forgiveness benefits. As benefits have only been available since October 1, 2017, little is known about the actual forgiveness benefits received. Predicting future participation is also challenging. Borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments to be eligible for forgiveness benefits under the PSLF program. Limited data is available on the forgiveness benefits received as the program only started on October 1, 2017. Predicting future participation is difficult due to the optional documentation of employment in public service jobs. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers who repay. Predicting future participation in the PSLF program is challenging as borrowers are not required to document their employment in public service jobs. Limited data is available on forgiveness benefits, and loan forgiveness is also possible through income-driven repayment plans. However, longitudinal data on these programs are not collected. Forgiveness benefits for income-driven repayment plans like ICR and IBR are available for borrowers who repay for extended periods. However, data collection on participants beyond program administration is limited, making it difficult to verify continued employment eligibility for forgiveness benefits. Data collection on participants for forgiveness benefits is limited beyond program administration, making it challenging to verify continued employment eligibility. Improved data collection and reporting may be necessary to assess program effects and potential design changes. Improved data collection and reporting are necessary to assess program effects and potential design changes, as there is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that may qualify for debt relief. There is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief under different programs, with some programs having specific limitations while others have more flexibility. Consideration should be given to imposing additional limitations on qualifying student loan debt. Consideration might be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for loan forgiveness and repayment programs, especially with the recent substantial increase in non-need-based loan aid amounts. In recent years, non-need-based loan aid amounts have increased, including PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Concerns have been raised about student loan forgiveness programs incentivizing students to over-borrow. Some concerns have been raised about student loan forgiveness programs incentivizing students to over-borrow by allowing them to borrow non-need-based federal student loans and then have a substantial portion discharged through loan forgiveness or repayment programs. Should limits be set on the amount or type of student loan debt eligible for relief? Selection criteria for agencies administering these programs can vary. Some concerns have been raised about student loan forgiveness programs incentivizing students to over-borrow by allowing them to borrow non-need-based federal student loans. Selection criteria for agencies administering these programs can vary greatly, with some agencies not administering a repayment program at all. In 2016, 34 federal agencies provided employees with loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse the agency if they do not complete their service. In 2016, 34 federal agencies offered loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse the agency if they do not complete their service. Participants cannot be in the excepted service and agencies have discretion in awarding benefits. Agencies can determine who receives benefits under the GESLRP, with limitations on employees in certain positions. The Department of Defense uses the program for recruitment, while the Department of State requires a minimum loan balance for eligibility. Individual agencies can customize their loan repayment programs to suit their needs within the government-wide program. The GESLRP is used by various government agencies for recruiting employees in specific positions. The Department of State requires a minimum loan balance of $5,000 for eligibility. Customized loan repayment programs can make eligibility requirements confusing for participants. The GESLRP is utilized by government agencies for recruiting employees in specific positions, with eligibility requirements that can be confusing for participants.

The appendix lists various loan forgiveness programs for public service employment, categorized by type and order of discussion in the report. Programs provide debt relief to qualified borrowers in different employment sectors, including federal government positions. Loan forgiveness programs for public service employment provide debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or employers. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms and conditions, potentially available to a large number of borrowers. Loan forgiveness programs for public service employment are available to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or employers. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms and conditions, potentially available to a large number of borrowers. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program falls under this category, aiming to provide student loan forgiveness. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers student loan forgiveness for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments while working full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Direct Loan program loans. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers student loan forgiveness for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments while working full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Direct Loan program Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Borrowers must be employed full-time in public service to qualify for loan forgiveness. To qualify for loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, borrowers must be employed full-time in public service, which includes working in public service organizations, AmeriCorps, or the Peace Corps. Public service organizations can be federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies, tribal colleges and universities, public child or family service agencies, tax-exempt nonprofit organizations, and certain private nonprofit organizations. Public service organizations eligible for loan forgiveness must provide various public services such as emergency management, public safety, law enforcement, public health, and education for individuals with disabilities and the elderly. An eligible public service organization must provide public services such as emergency management, military service, law enforcement, public interest law services, early childhood education, services for individuals with disabilities and the elderly, public health, public education, public library services, and school-based services. The maximum amount that may be forgiven is any remaining loan balance after 120 qualifying monthly payments. Borrowers must make 120 separate, full, on-time, scheduled monthly payments within 15 days of the due date to be eligible for loan forgiveness. The maximum benefit amount for loan forgiveness is the remaining loan balance after 120 qualifying monthly payments. Borrowers must make 120 separate, full, on-time, scheduled monthly payments within 15 days of the due date to be eligible. Borrowers must make 120 separate, full, on-time, scheduled monthly payments within 15 days of the due date. Payments must be made according to specific repayment plans, and borrowers must be employed full-time in public service when making the payments, applying for forgiveness, and when forgiveness is granted. Loans must not be in default for forgiveness eligibility. To qualify for loan forgiveness, borrowers must make 120 full, on-time monthly payments while employed full-time in public service. Loans must not be in default. Religious activities do not count towards public service. The forgiven amount is tax-exempt and falls under mandatory budgetary classification. Borrowers must make 120 on-time monthly payments while employed full-time in public service to qualify for loan forgiveness. Religious activities do not count towards public service.
