The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011. The final regulations for mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau, not the FRB, under the CFP Act. The authority to issue these regulations will transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011. The Secretary may also have the authority to issue regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed. The Secretary may have the authority to issue final regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed under the CFP Act. However, the limits of the Secretary's authority may not always be clear, leading to potential lawsuits claiming actions exceed authority. Portions of the CFP Act may be subject to various interpretations, leading to potential lawsuits challenging the Secretary's actions. The outcomes of such lawsuits are unpredictable due to the numerous factors that could give rise to legal claims."
