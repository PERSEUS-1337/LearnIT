The Act may be cited as the \"Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015\". The \"Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015\" aims to minimize compliance burdens under the Affordable Care Act while protecting individual privacy. It includes provisions for a prospective reporting system and eligibility verification for ACA subsidies.
