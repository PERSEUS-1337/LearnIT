The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $120 million for the Department of Energy for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage, along with an additional $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the licensing process. The FY2019 budget request includes $120 million for the Department of Energy for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage, along with an additional $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the licensing process. The House passed an appropriations bill that includes $100 million more than the Administration requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version includes no funding. The House passed an FY2019 appropriations bill for Energy and Water Development, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, including $100 million more than the Administration requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill, passed on June 25, 2018, includes no Yucca Mountain funding. Yucca Mountain is the only location under consideration by the Department of Energy for a national high-level radioactive waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 designated Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for a national high-level radioactive waste repository. Despite the Obama Administration halting funding for the project after FY2010, Yucca Mountain remains the only site named in the NWPA. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository project in 2010 and moved to withdraw the application. Despite this, Yucca Mountain remains the sole candidate site named in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to develop a new nuclear waste policy, recommending the creation of a new organization for this purpose. The Obama Administration terminated the Yucca Mountain repository project and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new nuclear waste policy. The commission recommended creating a new organization to promptly develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent based\" process involving negotiations with various levels of government. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a new organization with the authority and resources to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent based\" process involving negotiations with government levels. The commission also suggested conducting long-term research on waste disposal technologies. In response, the DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in 2013. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in 2013, following the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendation for long-term research on waste disposal technologies. The strategy called for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites, with plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. The DOE strategy in January 2013 proposed a new nuclear waste management entity for consent-based storage and disposal sites. Plans included a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public meetings were held in 2016, and a draft consent-based siting process was issued in January 2017. The House approved a bill (H.R. 3053) on May 10, 2018. A geologic disposal facility is planned to open by 2048, 50 years after the initial target date for the Yucca Mountain repository. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process in January 2017, and the House approved a bill (H.R. 3053) in May 2018 to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site from other uses. This withdrawal would fulfill one of the remaining licensing conditions identified by the NRC staff in its Safety Evaluation Report. The bill (H.R. 3053) passed in May 2018 would withdraw the Yucca Mountain site from other uses under public lands laws, fulfilling a licensing condition identified by the NRC staff in their Safety Evaluation Report. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in response to a court order regarding the Yucca Mountain repository. The report concluded that the repository design met safety and environmental standards but recommended not authorizing construction until all requirements were met. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) on DOE's Yucca Mountain repository design, stating it met safety and environmental standards. However, construction authorization was not recommended until all land and water rights requirements were fulfilled and a supplement to the environmental impact statement was completed. NRC made the licensing documents publicly available in May 2016, using remaining funds, and requested $330 million in additional appropriations to complete the licensing process. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS for Yucca Mountain in May 2016 and made licensing documents publicly available. Former NRC Chairman Stephen Burns requested $330 million for the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues. The Trump Administration is seeking $47.7 million for NRC licensing activities and $120 million for DOE to defend its license application and develop interim storage facilities in FY2019. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain, along with $120 million for DOE to defend its license application and develop interim storage facilities. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities, reversing a 1985 decision by the Reagan Administration. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities, reversing a 1985 decision by the Reagan Administration. This defense-only repository would be easier to site, license, and construct compared to a combined defense-civilian repository. The Obama Administration proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository, separate from civilian waste, which was deemed easier to site, license, and construct due to the smaller volume and radioactivity of defense waste. The Department of Energy suggested that this repository could be developed outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, potentially not requiring any amendments to proceed. The Department of Energy proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository that could be developed outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework. The repository would need to comply with NWPA requirements and be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Disposal of defense waste could potentially begin about 22 years after development. The Department of Energy proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework. The repository would need to comply with NWPA requirements and be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Disposal of defense waste could potentially begin about 22 years after development, but a Government Accountability Office report raised concerns about cost and schedule estimates. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the Department of Energy's plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository, citing major cost omissions and an overly optimistic schedule. Republican leaders also accused the plan of being a diversion from progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation introduced in January 2017 (H.R. 433) aimed to block the development of a defense-only repository. Republican leaders criticized the Department of Energy's plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository, calling it a diversion from progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation introduced in January 2017 (H.R. 433) aimed to block the development of a defense-only repository, with similar provisions included in nuclear waste legislation passed in May 2018. Authorization for DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel was included in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The Department of Energy's plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository was criticized by Republican leaders as a diversion from progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation aimed to block the development of such a repository, with provisions included in nuclear waste legislation passed in May 2018. Authorization for DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel was also included in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The FY2019 appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) passed by the Senate on June 25, 2018, includes provisions for the Department of Energy to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. Priority for storage at these facilities would be given to fuel from closed nuclear plant sites, and selection of a site would require consent from the governor, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes. DOE must report to Congress on the need for compensation or incentives for host jurisdictions and recommend a mechanism for waste storage. The DOE is required to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, with priority given to fuel from closed plant sites. Selection of a site would need consent from the governor, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes. Congress must be informed about the need for compensation or incentives for host jurisdictions and a mechanism for waste storage. The Senate Appropriations Committee has included provisions for a consent-based pilot program for interim storage in previous Energy and Water Development funding bills. The House has not included similar provisions in its bills. A nuclear waste bill passed by the House authorizes the DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. The House has not included consent-based siting provisions for interim storage in its Energy and Water bills. However, a nuclear waste bill passed by the House allows DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. The bill authorizes DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities owned by non-federal entities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to implement recommendations for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) was introduced by Senator Lamar Alexander but not enacted. It aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for finding nuclear waste storage and disposal sites with consent from state and local officials. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The facility, to be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, will hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos, with a total storage capacity of about 120,000 metric tons. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) in New Mexico plans to develop a storage facility for 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos over 20 phases. Each phase will contain 500 canisters with a total capacity of 120,000 metric tons. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for an NRC license for a similar facility in Texas but later requested a suspension due to high licensing costs. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas with a total storage capacity of 120,000 metric tons. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility on June 11, 2018. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with local support. WCS had initially estimated high licensing costs and planned to complete construction by 2022. The Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years. WCS operates two low-level radioactive waste storage facilities in TX with local support. WCS requested suspension of the license application, aiming to complete construction by 2022. DOE would take title to spent fuel, ship it to Texas, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years. WCS argues a privately developed facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) in Texas requested a license application suspension to complete construction by 2022. WCS plans to store spent fuel for up to 40 years, with costs covered by the DOE through appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. Legislation (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018, authorizes DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. A related bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa is similar to bills from the 114th Congress but not enacted. DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to the private storage facility. Annual interest earned by the Nuclear Waste Fund, estimated at $1.5 billion in FY2017, could be utilized. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request sought funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is again seeking funding for Yucca Mountain, with DOE potentially receiving $110 million. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request sought funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is again seeking funding for Yucca Mountain, with DOE potentially receiving $110 million for NRC licensing and interim storage development. DOE would receive $110 million for NRC licensing and $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. The total funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019 is $120 million, sourced from two appropriations accounts. The DOE funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019 includes $90 million for Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version included no funding for the project. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version included no funding for the project. This situation continues a pattern seen in recent years, where funding for Yucca Mountain has not been approved. The DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees for Yucca Mountain due to a court ruling, totaling about $750 million per year. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to halt the fees, citing uncertainty about the program's future. District of Columbia Circuit ordered DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal, totaling $750 million per year. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans are too vague to estimate costs accurately, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion deemed \"absolutely useless.\" The court ordered DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal due to vague waste plans with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion, making cost estimates useless. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the waste fee. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the waste fee. NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. The NRC approved a final rule on August 26, 2014, for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule that was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The new rule addresses the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel at nuclear plants for at least 60 years after shutdown and the availability of permanent disposal when necessary. The court ruled that an environmental review should have been conducted before issuing the previous waste confidence findings. The court ruled that the NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing the waste confidence findings in December 2010. As a result, NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste. After a court ruling in December 2010, the NRC stopped licensing new facilities generating radioactive waste. The NRC's suspension of final licensing decisions was lifted in August 2014 with the approval of the continued storage rule. A consolidated lawsuit challenging the NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. In August 2014, NRC approved the continued storage rule, ending the suspension of final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. A lawsuit challenging the rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015, primarily affecting materials with low concentrations of radioactive materials. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015, with final revisions issued by the commission in September 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure protection of the general public. The NRC issued revisions to its low-level waste disposal regulations on September 8, 2017, to establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites. This is crucial for protecting the general population from the risks associated with nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a deep underground repository for highly radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel. Nevada strongly opposes this plan. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act mandates the Department of Energy to focus on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for radioactive waste, despite strong opposition from Nevada citing safety concerns. The DOE supported Yucca Mountain as a repository despite Nevada's safety concerns, citing volcanic activity, earthquakes, water infiltration, and human intrusion risks. The Obama Administration later opposed the project. The Obama Administration opposed opening the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition, leading to a halt in funding and closure of the project. The Obama Administration's policy decision to halt funding and close the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition led to the shutdown of the project at the end of FY2010. President Trump intends to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage in his FY2019 budget submission to Congress on February 12, 2018. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided no DOE funding for the program, leading to the shutdown of the Yucca Mountain project at the end of FY2010. President Trump plans to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process by requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage in his FY2019 budget submission to Congress. The Department of Energy (DOE) would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, while the NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. Additionally, DOE would get $10 million to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Under the Obama Administration, DOE had filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010. Under the FY2019 request, DOE would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. DOE would also receive $10 million to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities. DOE had filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, \"with prejudice,\" with strong support from Nevada but opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste expected to go to Yucca. The Department of Energy (DOE) filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, \"with prejudice,\" meaning it could not be resubmitted in the future. The withdrawal received support from Nevada but opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste expected to go to Yucca. State utility regulators also intervened, arguing that dismissing the application would hinder the government's obligation to dispose of the nation's nuclear waste.

State utility regulators also intervened, arguing that dismissing the application would hinder the government's obligation to dispose of the nation's nuclear waste. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC commissioners sustained the ASLB decision on a tie vote on September 9, 2011, halting further consideration of the license application. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC commissioners sustained the ASLB decision on a tie vote on September 9, 2011. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the Yucca Mountain license withdrawal, with the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling on August 13, 2013, that NRC must continue work on the license application as long as funding is available. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on August 13, 2013, that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available, directing the completion of the safety evaluation report. The court ruled that NRC had funds for the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report. NRC completed the report in January 2015, concluding the repository design met safety standards for 1 million years. Staff recommended against authorizing construction. NRC completed the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in January 2015, stating the repository design met safety standards for 1 million years. Staff recommended against authorizing construction until all requirements were met. NRC made the licensing documents publicly available in May 2016. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS for the Yucca Mountain project in May 2016 and made licensing documents publicly available. NRC Chairman stated that an additional $330 million would be needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada and others. The Obama Administration halted the project in 2010. The NRC Chairman testified that $330 million in additional appropriations would be needed to complete the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain project, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada and others. The Obama Administration halted the project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended the creation of a new organization to promptly develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended creating a new organization to promptly develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities using a \"consent based\" process to select sites. The DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal in response to the BRC report. The DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Nuclear Waste in response to the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendation for a new organization to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale storage facility. The DOE's strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste included plans for a new entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. This involved opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public input was sought to help with the siting process. The DOE planned to open a geologic disposal facility by 2048, 50 years after the initial Yucca Mountain repository opening date. Public input was sought to develop a consent-based siting process, with public meetings held through mid-2016 to address various concerns. The DOE held public meetings through mid-2016 to address concerns about the siting process for a geologic disposal facility. The draft consent-based siting process was issued on January 12, 2017, with five phases outlined. Legislation would authorize and fund a waste management agency to conduct the process and provide grants to interested communities. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process on January 12, 2017, with five phases outlined: Phase 1 involves siting process initiation and community outreach, Phase 2 includes preliminary site assessment, and Phase 3 consists of a detailed site assessment. Legislation would authorize and fund a waste management agency to conduct the process and provide grants to interested communities. Phase 2 involves a preliminary site assessment taking 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-4 years for a permanent repository. After this, interested communities can request a detailed site assessment in Phase 3, which takes 2-4 years for interim storage and 5-10 years for a repository. Communities with suitable sites would then decide on hosting storage or disposal facilities in Phase 4, which includes negotiating a siting agreement approved by all required parties. Phase 4 involves communities deciding on hosting storage or disposal facilities, negotiating a siting agreement approved by all required parties. Phase 5 includes licensing, construction, operation, and closure, estimated to take up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. An interim storage facility would operate for up to 100 years and a repository for up to 150 years before closure. Phase 5 involves licensing, construction, operation, and closure of storage or disposal facilities, with estimated timelines of up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of supporting documents. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of supporting documents. The request for $10 million for interim storage would involve planning for storage services, transportation, and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completion of NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuit of alternative storage facilities. The nuclear power industry supports completion of NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuit of alternative storage facilities. The target date for opening a repository site should be within 20 years of a consolidated storage site opening. Geologic disposal safety depends on rock formation characteristics. The nuclear power industry supports the opening of Yucca Mountain or an alternative repository site within 20 years of a consolidated storage site. Geologic disposal safety relies on the characteristics of rock formations. It is believed that isolating radioactive materials in undisturbed formations can keep the environment safe until they decay to safe levels. The National Research Council supports geologic isolation as the best long-term option for high-level waste disposal, but scientific confidence in specific sites like Yucca Mountain has been challenging. Every proposed high-level waste site has faced controversy and allegations. The National Research Council recommends geologic isolation as the best long-term option for high-level waste disposal. However, proposed waste sites have faced challenges and allegations due to uncertainties in predicting site performance over the 1 million years of isolation required for nuclear waste. The National Research Council recommends geologic isolation as the best long-term option for high-level waste disposal, but proposed waste sites have faced challenges due to uncertainties in predicting site performance over the 1 million years required for nuclear waste isolation. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. President Obama's budgets for FY2017 and previous years included long-term research on technologies to reduce the volume and toxicity of nuclear waste, including reprocessing spent fuel to recycle long-lived elements like plutonium. This approach has faced controversy due to cost concerns and potential weapons use. The Bush Administration proposed large-scale facilities to reprocess and recycle spent nuclear fuel by separating long-lived elements like plutonium. This approach has faced controversy due to cost concerns and potential weapons use. The Obama Administration refocused DOE's nuclear waste research towards fundamental science, moving away from near-term reprocessing facility development. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request would reduce funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing. The Obama Administration shifted DOE's nuclear waste research towards fundamental science, moving away from reprocessing facilities. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget would reduce funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing. President Bush recommended Yucca Mountain for a repository site, but Nevada Governor Guinn vetoed the decision. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for a repository, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn who issued a state veto. Congress approved the site within 90 days, leading to its development. Public controversy also surrounds low-level radioactive waste. The Yucca Mountain site was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2002. Public controversy also surrounds the disposal of low-level radioactive waste from various sources. Low-level radioactive waste is currently disposed of in large trenches at sites in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. The Washington facility only accepts waste from its region, while the South Carolina site is available to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. Class A waste is accepted by a Utah commercial disposal facility nationwide. Congressional authorization of regional disposal facilities was prompted by threats of closure by states. The Atlantic disposal compact, consisting of Connecticut, New Jersey, and South Carolina, has exclusive access to a disposal site as of June 30, 2008. A Utah facility accepts class A low-level radioactive waste from across the United States. Congressional authorization in 1985 led to the creation of regional compacts for waste disposal. The first new disposal site under this system opened in Andrews, TX on November 10, 2011, with Texas allowing up to 30% capacity for states outside the Texas Compact. The regional compacts for low-level waste disposal were authorized by Congress in 1985. The first new disposal site opened near Andrews, TX in 2011, with Texas allowing up to 30% capacity for states outside the Texas Compact. The NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste. The NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste for disposal. DOE was to dispose of the waste in return for a fee on nuclear power generation. The act required nuclear reactors to have a disposal contract with DOE to operate, with a deadline for waste disposal by January 31, 1998. DOE missed the deadline, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. After DOE missed the deadline for nuclear waste disposal, nuclear utilities began filing lawsuits to recover additional storage costs. DOE settled with PECO Energy Company, allowing them to keep up to $80 million in nuclear waste fee revenues over 10 years. Other utilities sued to block the settlement. DOE settled with PECO Energy Company, allowing them to keep up to $80 million in nuclear waste fee revenues over 10 years. Other utilities sued to block the settlement, arguing that compensation for missing the disposal deadline should come from general revenues, not the waste fund. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that nuclear waste fees can only be used for the DOE waste program, not as compensation for missing disposal deadlines. Utilities received compensation from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling $4.9 billion from settlements and $2 billion. The U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund has provided compensation to utilities for nuclear waste, totaling $6.9 billion through settlements and court judgments by FY2017. 39 lawsuits were settled, representing 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity generation, with 46 cases receiving final court judgments. Utilities can submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delays. The U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund has compensated utilities for nuclear waste with $6.9 billion through settlements and court judgments by FY2017. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related storage costs. Disagreements over claims go to arbitration, while unresolved cases seek compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund has compensated utilities with $6.9 billion for nuclear waste through settlements and court judgments by FY2017. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related storage costs, with disagreements going to arbitration. Unresolved cases seek compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, where potential liabilities for waste program delays could reach $34.1 billion. DOE estimates potential liabilities for nuclear waste delays could reach $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid in settlements. Utilities must continue filing claims for additional delay-related costs. Delays in waste disposal program could lead to future environmental enforcement actions. DOE's potential liabilities for nuclear waste delays could reach $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid in settlements. Delays in the waste disposal program could lead to future environmental enforcement actions over DOE's high-level waste and spent fuel. Some of the waste is currently stored in noncompliance with environmental laws, making DOE subject to fines if not removed according to compliance schedules. The DOE is facing potential fines for storing nuclear waste in noncompliance with environmental laws. The nuclear waste disposal fee collection was suspended in 2014 after the Yucca Mountain project was halted, following a federal court ruling in favor of waste-fee opponents. The nuclear waste fee collection was suspended in 2014 after DOE halted the Yucca Mountain project. The nuclear industry and state utility regulators sued to stop further fee collections, arguing that the fees should not be collected while the project is on hold. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) filed suits against the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2010 to challenge the collection of $750 million in fees per year for nuclear waste disposal. The Department of Energy (DOE) argued that the fees must continue to be collected for future disposal costs despite the halt in the nuclear waste disposal program. Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined in November 2010 that there was no reasonable basis to stop fee collection at that time. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal program has been halted, but the DOE insists on continuing to collect fees for future disposal costs. Energy Secretary Steven Chu's determination in November 2010 that excess funds were not being collected was challenged by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2012. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in June 2012 that Energy Secretary Chu's decision to maintain nuclear waste fees unchanged lacked a valid evaluation. The court ordered a more thorough study within six months, emphasizing the need to assess alternative costs and timing. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered Energy Secretary Chu to conduct a more thorough study of nuclear waste fees within six months. The court emphasized the need to evaluate alternative costs and timing, as the previous assessment relied on projections for the terminated Yucca Mountain site. DOE responded with a new fee adequacy assessment in January 2013, revealing potential deficits of up to $2 trillion in some waste management scenarios. DOE conducted a new fee adequacy assessment in January 2013 to evaluate various waste management scenarios. Some scenarios showed costs exceeding projected revenues by $2 trillion, while others resulted in a surplus of up to $5 trillion. Due to the varying results, DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to immediately adjust the fee. NEI and NARUC requested a review, leading to the Circuit Court ordering DOE to halt nuclear waste fee collection in November 2013. After a review of DOE's waste management scenarios, the Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees in November 2013. The court found DOE's cost estimates to be too vague and unreliable, with a $7 trillion uncertainty range deemed \"absolutely useless\" for determining the waste fee. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague for estimating fees, leading to the halt of nuclear waste fee collection from power generators in 2014. The Trump Administration planned to reassess fees based on previous cost estimates for Yucca Mountain until new information is available. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and reassess nuclear waste fees based on previous cost estimates. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is not a viable long-term option. The Department of Energy filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" on March 3, 2010, stating that a repository at Yucca Mountain is not a feasible long-term solution for nuclear waste disposal due to opposition from Nevada and a desire for a better waste solution. The Department of Energy filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" on March 3, 2010, citing opposition from Nevada and the need for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The license withdrawal was not based on scientific or technical findings but on the desire to end the Yucca Mountain project. The ASLB denied the withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, stating that the NWPA prohibits DOE from withdrawing the application until NRC. The Department of Energy filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" on March 3, 2010, citing opposition from Nevada and the need for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The ASLB denied the withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, stating that the NWPA prohibits DOE from withdrawing the application until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. The Department of Energy filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, but the ASLB denied it, stating that DOE cannot withdraw the application until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. DOE argued that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. The Department of Energy argued that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to make policy decisions regarding disposal of nuclear waste, including discontinuing the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC commissioners sustained the licensing board's denial of the license withdrawal in a tie vote on September 9, 2011. The NRC commissioners sustained the licensing board's denial of the license withdrawal on a tie vote in September 2011. NRC halted further consideration of the license application due to budgetary limitations. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, petitioned the court to order NRC to continue the licensing proceedings, which the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of on August 13, 2013. The NRC halted the Yucca Mountain license application due to budget constraints. After a court ruling in August 2013, NRC was required to continue work on the application using available funds. NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015 and used remaining funds for additional assessments. The NRC was required by a court ruling to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application using available funds. NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015 and used remaining funds for additional assessments. Additional funding of about $330 million would be needed for NRC to complete the licensing review, with DOE estimating its costs at about $1.9 billion. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for Yucca Mountain, with additional funding of about $330 million required for NRC to complete the licensing review. DOE estimates its costs as the license applicant would total about $1.9 billion. DOE's FY2018 congressional budget request includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and legal and technical support for the license application.

DOE estimates its costs as the license applicant would total about $1.9 billion. DOE's FY2018 congressional budget request includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office, legal and technical support for the license application, and the management of supporting documents. An additional $30 million is requested by NRC to restart the ASLB adjudicatory proceeding. NRC is required to determine that waste from nuclear facilities can be safely disposed of before issuing licenses. The NRC is requesting an additional $30 million to restart the ASLB adjudicatory proceeding related to the licensing of nuclear reactors and waste storage facilities. This is necessary to ensure that nuclear waste can be safely disposed of, as required by a 1979 court decision. The original Waste Confidence Decision in 1984 stated that waste could be stored safely for 30 years after plant closure, with a permanent repository expected by 2007-2009. However, due to delays in opening a repository, the decision was updated in 1990. The NRC updated the Waste Confidence Decision in 1990 to state that a nuclear waste repository would be available by the first quarter of the 21st century. Despite delays in the Yucca Mountain repository, a rule in 2010 affirmed that waste could be safely stored at reactor sites until a repository is available. The NRC updated the Waste Confidence Decision in 1990, predicting a repository by the 21st century. The 2010 rule allowed safe waste storage at reactor sites until a repository is available. Lawsuits challenged the rule for not considering environmental risks, with the Court of Appeals largely agreeing. The NRC's 2010 waste confidence rule allowed safe waste storage at reactor sites for 60 years post-shutdown. Lawsuits, including one from the State of New York and environmental groups, challenged the rule for not adequately considering environmental risks. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review under NEPA due to flaws in the rulemaking process. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision under NEPA. The court found flaws in the NRC's rulemaking process regarding the availability of permanent storage and the safety of on-site storage for spent fuel. The NRC failed to calculate the environmental effects of not securing permanent storage and did not properly examine future dangers and consequences of storing spent fuel on site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. NRC's final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel was approved in August 2014 after a two-year halt in licensing new facilities producing nuclear waste. The NRC's final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel was approved in August 2014 after a two-year halt in licensing new facilities producing nuclear waste. The rule replaced the waste confidence rule and focused on environmental effects of waste storage based on a generic environmental impact statement. The new continued storage rule addresses future availability of waste disposal facilities and environmental effects of various periods of waste storage based on a generic environmental impact statement. The rule analyzes short-term, long-term, and indefinite timeframes for storage before a permanent repository is established. The GEIS analyzed environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available: \"short-term timeframe,\" up to 60 years after reactor shutdown; \"long-term timeframe,\" up to 160 years after shutdown; and an \"indefinite timeframe,\" where a repository may never be available. The environmental impact was deemed minimal for all time frames. The GEIS analyzed environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available: \"short-term timeframe,\" up to 60 years after reactor shutdown; \"long-term timeframe,\" up to 160 years after shutdown; and an \"indefinite timeframe,\" where a repository may never be available. The environmental impact was judged to be minimal in almost all categories. A consolidated lawsuit to overturn NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2016. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected a consolidated lawsuit to overturn NRC's continued storage rule in 2016. The controversy over the termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration led to a debate in Congress, with the House supporting funding for Yucca Mountain and the Senate opposing it. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has further fueled the debate, especially with the retirement of Senator Reid of Nevada, a strong opponent of Yucca Mountain. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has changed the dynamics of the congressional debate on nuclear waste, along with the retirement of Senator Reid of Nevada, who had strongly opposed Yucca Mountain as the Democratic leader. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project in FY2018 but the Senate not doing so. In FY2019 appropriations legislation, the House included $100 million for Yucca Mountain. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project in FY2018 but the Senate not doing so. In FY2019 appropriations legislation, the House included $100 million for Yucca Mountain, while concerns about nuclear waste were raised during a confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry. The House included $100 million above the Administration's Yucca Mountain funding request, while the Senate did not provide any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada pressed Governor Perry on the issue of Yucca Mountain before confirming him as Secretary of Energy. After Senator Catherine Cortez Masto's vote to confirm Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy in January 2017, she emphasized the importance of preventing Yucca Mountain from becoming a nuclear waste site. Despite differences on other issues, she expressed confidence in working with Perry to ensure Yucca Mountain remains inactive. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) was also mentioned in relation to this issue. Senator Cortez Masto emphasized the importance of preventing Yucca Mountain from becoming a nuclear waste site and expressed confidence in working with Governor Perry on this issue. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) aims to withdraw the repository site from public lands laws and place it solely under DOE's control, while authorizing storage of spent fuel at an NRC-licensed interim facility. The House-passed bill (H.R. 3053) would withdraw the Yucca Mountain repository site from public lands laws, increase its capacity to store spent nuclear fuel, and authorize storage at an NRC-licensed interim facility. The House-passed bill (H.R. 3053) would increase the capacity of the Yucca Mountain repository to store spent nuclear fuel from 70,000 to 110,000 metric tons. It also includes changes such as the elimination of mandatory funding provisions to address criticism of the Nuclear Waste Fund being used for deficit reduction. The Energy and Commerce Committee's report on H.R. 3053 proposed eliminating mandatory funding provisions for the Nuclear Waste Fund and providing mandatory funding for specific stages of repository development. The bill also allows future nuclear waste fee collections to offset appropriations for the nuclear waste program. Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities would be used for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. The House passed bill H.R. 3053 proposes using Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. The bill specifies that the Department of Energy (DOE) would take ownership of the spent fuel when accepting it at commercial reactor sites for storage at an MRS facility. DOE is authorized to site, construct, and operate one or more MRS facilities, or store spent fuel alternatively. H.R. 3053 authorizes DOE to take ownership of spent nuclear fuel at commercial reactor sites for storage at MRS facilities. DOE can build federal MRS facilities or store fuel at nonfederal MRS facilities with agreements. Nonfederal entities must have NRC license before DOE can enter into MRS agreements. DOE can store spent fuel from commercial reactors at MRS facilities developed by nonfederal entities with NRC licenses. Nonfederal entities must have waste storage approval from relevant authorities before DOE can enter into MRS agreements. Priority is given to a nonfederal entity before NRC issues a final decision on the Yucca Mountain construction authorization. DOE can store spent fuel at MRS facilities developed by nonfederal entities with NRC licenses. Approval from relevant authorities is required before entering into MRS agreements. Priority is given to nonfederal entities, unless a federal MRS is deemed quicker and cheaper by the Secretary of Energy. Closed reactor fuel has shipment priority to MRS, subject to DOE's waste disposal contract. Priority for storing spent fuel at a potential MRS facility would be given to nonfederal entities, unless the Secretary of Energy determines a federal MRS could be built faster and cheaper. Closed reactor fuel has priority for shipment to an MRS, subject to DOE's waste disposal contract. Appropriations for the MRS would come from the general fund instead of the Nuclear Waste Fund. Storage at the MRS facility would not be allowed until NRC approves the Yucca Mountain repository construction or the Secretary of Energy deems NRC's decision imminent. Appropriations for an MRS would be authorized from the general fund instead of the Nuclear Waste Fund. Waste storage at the initial MRS facility would be contingent on NRC approval for the Yucca Mountain repository construction or an imminent decision by the Secretary of Energy. MRS construction would halt if the repository license is revoked. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository, located on federal land, would require construction authorization before an MRS facility could begin construction. H.R. 3053 aims to permanently withdraw the site from federal public land laws and transfer jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy. The Yucca Mountain repository, spanning 147,000 acres of federal land, would be used for storing nuclear waste. H.R. 3053 seeks to permanently withdraw the site from federal public land laws and transfer jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy for the development of the repository. This withdrawal is necessary for the Department of Energy to obtain a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Yucca Mountain repository, spanning 147,000 acres of federal land, would store nuclear waste. H.R. 3053 aims to withdraw the site for the Secretary of Energy to develop the repository. This withdrawal is crucial for the Department of Energy to obtain a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Nuclear waste at the repository would not be subject to certain hazardous waste requirements. NRC's final decision on construction authorization would be required within 30 months after enactment. The Solid Waste Disposal Act requires federal waste facilities to comply with hazardous waste requirements. The final decision on issuing a construction authorization for the Yucca Mountain repository must be made within 30 months. The limit on spent nuclear fuel disposal at Yucca Mountain would be raised to 110,000 metric tons. DOE could conduct infrastructure activities before the decision, such as site preparation and rail line construction. The authorization allows DOE to conduct infrastructure activities at Yucca Mountain, raising the limit on spent nuclear fuel disposal to 110,000 metric tons. Planning for a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until NRC's final decision on Yucca Mountain. DOE cannot resume nuclear waste fee collection until NRC approves or disapproves the construction authorization. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume collecting nuclear waste fees until the NRC makes a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Fees collected after enactment will offset appropriations for the DOE nuclear waste management program. Unpaid fees may be required to be paid later as determined by the Secretary. The nuclear waste fees collected after the NRC's final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository would be limited to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations for the DOE nuclear waste management program. Any uncollected fees may be required to be paid later as determined by the Secretary. These fees would offset appropriations for the nuclear waste program, ensuring that annual appropriations do not exceed the available fees. The bill specifies that fees collected after the date of enactment would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program, ensuring that annual appropriations do not exceed the available fees. This would not affect net direct spending for budget purposes or trigger mandatory spending offsets under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The bill specifies that the existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available for appropriation without offsets. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into a benefits agreement with Nevada for annual payments of $15 million before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would also receive $400 million upon the first spent fuel delivery. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into a benefits agreement with Nevada, providing annual payments of $15 million before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would also receive $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt and annual payments of $40 million thereafter. Additionally, DOE could reach benefits agreements with other local governments. Acceptance of a benefits agreement does not imply consent to host the waste. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and other local governments, providing annual payments of $15 million before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would also receive $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt and annual payments of $40 million thereafter. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would be responsible for carrying out the functions established by NWPA and report directly to the Secretary of Energy. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) would be responsible for carrying out the functions of the Secretary of Energy established by NWPA and would report directly to the Secretary. The OCRWM Director would serve as many as two five-year terms and could be removed by the President only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\" rather than serving at the pleasure of the President. The OCRWM Director, appointed for two five-year terms, would report directly to the Secretary of Energy. Functions related to nuclear waste management would be transferred to OCRWM from a DOE Assistant Secretary. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, requiring consent from State and local governments before expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Department of Energy Organization Act (P.L. 95-91) functions would be transferred to OCRWM. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act (S. 95, H.R. 456) to require consent from State and local governments before using funds for a nuclear waste repository. This legislation follows a consent-based approach recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Similar legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress but was not enacted. The legislation introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus requires consent from State and local governments before using funds for a nuclear waste repository, following a consent-based approach recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Representative Joe Wilson also introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act, which would forbid the Department of Energy from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson in the 114th Congress would prevent the Department of Energy from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, there are proposals in Texas and New Mexico for private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial spent nuclear fuel, with a bill (H.R. 474) introduced to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with these facilities. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa in 2017 authorizes DOE to contract with private spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act is similar to previous legislation but not enacted, requiring DOE to take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Issa, is similar to previous legislation (H.R. 3643, H.R. 4745) but not enacted. It requires DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. Additionally, Representative Lowey introduced the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) to authorize DOE for similar purposes. The Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) introduced by Representative Lowey authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Priority is given to nuclear plant sites with no currently operating reactors and a population of at least 15 million within a 50-mile radius. Legislation aims to provide assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) aims to assist communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. The bills propose providing communities with financial assistance for nuclear waste storage, reviving a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in affected areas, and making these communities eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit. The bills introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) aim to provide financial assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. This includes offering $15 per kilogram of nuclear waste, reviving a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in affected areas, and making communities eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit. Additionally, the bills would establish a task force to streamline the process for communities applying for government assistance and require the Department of Energy to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. The bills introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider aim to provide financial assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. This includes offering $15 per kilogram of nuclear waste, reviving a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in affected areas, and making communities eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit. The bills would also establish a task force to simplify the process for communities applying for government assistance and require the Department of Energy to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. Additionally, concerns have been raised in Congress about the risks posed by spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants, leading to proposals to move spent fuel to dry storage casks. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) introduced in the 115th Congress aims to require nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for removing spent fuel from storage pools and transferring it to dry storage casks within seven years. This legislation addresses concerns about the risks posed by spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) introduced in the 115th Congress requires nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for transferring spent fuel from storage pools to dry storage facilities within seven years. Emergency planning zones would be expanded around reactors not complying with the transfer plan. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) mandates transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities after seven years in storage pools. Emergency planning zones would expand to a 50-mile radius for non-compliant reactors. NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to aid in the transfer process. H.R. 4891 mandates transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities after seven years in storage pools. The bill is similar to previous legislation introduced in the 114th and 113th Congresses, aiming to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for nuclear waste storage development. Introduced in March 2015, legislation (S. 854) proposed establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) to manage nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The bill required consent from state, local, and tribal governments for facility siting and aimed to open a pilot storage facility by the end of 2021 for nuclear waste from shutdown reactors. The proposed legislation (S. 854) aimed to establish the Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for managing nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. NWA would have been required to open a pilot storage facility by the end of 2021 for priority waste, with a permanent repository planned by 2048. Authorization for selecting sites for nonpriority waste storage facilities would have been limited to the first 10 years. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) was set to establish storage facilities for priority waste by 2021 and a permanent repository by 2048. NWA could only select sites for nonpriority waste storage facilities within the first 10 years if funds were allocated for a permanent repository. Financial compensation and incentives would be offered for hosting nuclear waste storage. After 10 years, NWA could not request proposals for nonpriority waste or select sites unless a candidate site for a repository had been selected. NWA would offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting nuclear waste storage facilities, with preference given to sites including storage facilities along with a repository. Highly radioactive defense waste could be placed in defense-only storage and disposal facilities under S. 854, subject to appropriations. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository on March 24, 2015, under S. 854. Nuclear waste fees collected after the bill's enactment were to be held in a Working Capital Fund for the Nuclear Waste Administration to use for S. 854, subject to annual appropriations. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository on March 24, 2015. Nuclear waste fees collected after the bill's enactment were to be held in a Working Capital Fund for the Nuclear Waste Administration to use for S. 854, subject to appropriations. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 on July 30, 2013. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 on July 30, 2013. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill, calling it a promising framework for addressing key issues. NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd also viewed the bill as a step in the right direction but emphasized the need for continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. The bill S. 1240 was supported by Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd, who called it a promising framework for addressing key issues and a step in the right direction. However, Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed the bill, citing concerns about temporary waste storage facilities opening without progress on a permanent repository and states having inadequate authority to regulate repository safety. The bill S. 854 requires actions on a permanent repository before a storage facility for nonpriority waste can be sited. DOE received initial funding for a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. Natural Resources Defense Council opposed the bill due to concerns about temporary waste storage facilities opening without progress on a permanent repository and states lacking authority to regulate repository safety. S. 854 requires actions on a permanent repository before a storage facility for nonpriority waste can be sited. The Senate approved authorization and initial funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. The Senate approved authorization and initial funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility, as part of the FY2016 Energy and Water bill. Similar language had been included in previous energy and water development appropriations bills passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate approved authorization and initial funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility in 2015. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. The House appropriations bills have not authorized nuclear waste storage, influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a bill similar to S. 2324 in 2015. The spent fuel pools at a plant were initially suspected to have boiled or leaked, potentially causing fuel damage and radioactive releases. However, later analysis showed that the spent fuel did not overheat. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 aimed to maintain safety and security requirements at closed reactors until spent fuel was moved to dry storage, but it was not enacted. NRC released a study in 2013 stating that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. The bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 (S. 944) aimed to maintain safety and security requirements at closed reactors until all spent fuel was moved to dry storage. However, a study by the NRC in 2013 concluded that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits and the expected costs would not be justified. Radioactive waste varies in its level of radioactivity and safety requirements. Radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials with varying levels of radioactivity. Some waste is safe to handle in unshielded containers, while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Major types of radioactive waste include spent nuclear fuel. Intensely hot and radioactive waste can decay to safe levels in days or weeks, while some types remain dangerous for thousands of years. Spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive civilian waste, contains uranium and plutonium that could be reprocessed for new fuel. Spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive civilian waste, contains uranium and plutonium that could be reprocessed for new fuel. It also includes highly radioactive residue from reprocessing, such as plutonium, which remains dangerous for tens of thousands of years. High-level nuclear waste, created by spent fuel reprocessing for defense purposes, contains radioactive fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. Transuranic waste, with remaining radioactive elements, requires isolation for 10,000 years or more. High-level waste from spent fuel reprocessing in the United States contains radioactive fission products, with uranium and plutonium removed for reuse. Long-lived radioactive elements remain, necessitating isolation for 10,000 years or more. Transuranic waste, generated mainly by nuclear weapons production, contains heavy elements like plutonium and may require radiation shielding for handling. Transuranic (TRU) waste, containing long-lived elements heavier than uranium, primarily plutonium, requires radiation shielding for handling. In the United States, TRU waste is mainly generated by nuclear weapons production processes, necessitating long-term isolation. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, which resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, primarily plutonium, generated by nuclear weapons production processes. Low-level waste, not classified as spent fuel or high-level waste, is also disposed of at the WIPP site. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, primarily plutonium, generated by nuclear weapons production processes. Low-level waste disposal facilities cannot accept material that exceeds NRC concentration limits. Low-level waste contains relatively low concentrations of radioactivity that decays quickly. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material. The curr_chunk discusses uranium mill tailings, which are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing that can pose hazards due to radon emissions or groundwater contamination. It also mentions mixed waste, which includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material regulated by different agencies. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies consisting of metal-clad fuel rods. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies consisting of metal-clad fuel rods. The fuel rods contain uranium enriched in U-235, which undergoes nuclear fission in the reactor, producing highly radioactive fission products. After nuclear fission in the reactor, U-235 nuclei split into radioactive fission products. Some U-238 nuclei become radioactive plutonium. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in water pools near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. Older spent fuel is removed to prevent pool overflow. The isotope U-238 absorbs neutrons and decays into radioactive plutonium, some of which splits into fission products. Newly withdrawn spent fuel assemblies are stored in water pools near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. Older spent fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to radiation-shielded storage facilities at reactor sites to prevent pool overflow. The NRC requires spent fuel to cool for 7-10 years before being transferred to dry storage. Currently, spent fuel from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at 59 operating nuclear plant sites. The NRC requires spent fuel to cool for 7-10 years before being transferred to dry storage. Spent fuel from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory. A large commercial nuclear reactor discharges an average of 20-30 metric tons of spent fuel per year, totaling about 2,200 metric tons annually for the entire U.S. nuclear power industry over the past two decades. The U.S. nuclear power industry has stored about 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel at various sites, including 30,000 metric tons in dry casks by the end of 2017. This exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, without considering an additional 7,000 metric tons of DOE spent fuel and high-level waste planned for disposal. The DOE estimates that 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel were stored at U.S. nuclear plants by the end of 2017, with 30,000 metric tons in dry casks. This exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, not including an additional 7,000 metric tons of DOE waste planned for disposal. The amount of stored fuel will continue to grow until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is opened, or alternative disposal technology is developed. The DOE estimates that 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel were stored at U.S. nuclear plants by the end of 2017, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. An additional 7,000 metric tons of DOE waste is planned for disposal. The amount of stored fuel will continue to grow until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is opened, or alternative disposal technology is developed. DOE's estimates for total spent fuel disposal range from 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons, requiring new storage capacity if waste acceptance is delayed. Estimates suggest that 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel from U.S. reactors will need disposal. New storage capacity will be necessary if the DOE cannot accept waste. Utilities are expected to build new dry storage facilities at reactor sites. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel were heightened after the 9/11 attacks. Most utilities are expected to construct new dry storage capacity at reactor sites. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel were heightened after the 9/11 attacks. A report by NRC found that overheating could cause the zirconium alloy cladding of spent fuel to catch fire and release hazardous amounts of radioactivity. The NRC and NAS reports highlighted the risk of overheating in spent fuel pools, potentially leading to fires and the release of radioactivity. Recommendations included interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies and installing spray systems to reduce the likelihood of such incidents. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found that successful terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools are possible. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring more fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the risk of fires. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time for alternative cooling measures before fuel catches fire. The nuclear industry suggests installing spray systems above pools and transferring more fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the risk of fires. The NRC's report in 2013 found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers of spent fuel. The safety of spent fuel pools is being examined by an NRC task force in light of lessons from the Fukushima accident. The task force recommends having assured sources of electrical power and water spray systems available for spent fuel. The NRC task force identified safety benefits in expedited transfers of spent fuel from pools to dry casks. Recommendations include having assured sources of electrical power and water spray systems available for spent fuel pools. NRC approved an order requiring reactors to install improved water-level monitoring equipment at their spent fuel pools. The NRC approved an order in 2012 requiring U.S. reactors to install improved water-level monitoring equipment at their spent fuel pools. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to commercial disposal sites in 2017. Volumes and radioactivity can vary widely based on nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. In 2017, 57,179 curies of radioactivity were shipped to commercial disposal sites. The volume and radioactivity of low-level waste can vary yearly based on nuclear decommissioning and cleanup activities. Low-level waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C, with Class A waste making up most of the volume and classes B and C containing the majority of the radioactivity. Low-level radioactive waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for handling and disposal. Class A waste makes up most of the volume, while classes B and C contain the majority of the radioactivity. Most of the nation's Class B and C waste has been stored on-site since June 2008 due to the lack of a permanent disposal site. States can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste, while disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository after FY2010, but the Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage at DOE. The Obama Administration stopped the Yucca Mountain repository development after FY2010. The Trump Administration is now proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage at DOE. The Obama Administration proposed a waste management strategy in 2013 for nuclear waste storage, including a pilot facility by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management was created to carry out the program. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The fee for the program is set at a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour and can be adjusted based on projected total program costs. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Fund was created to finance the program through a fee on commercial nuclear power. The fee, set at a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour, can be adjusted based on projected program costs. DOE was required to select three candidate sites for the repository, leading to controversy and subsequent modifications by the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The act was modified in 1987 to only consider Yucca Mountain, Nevada as a candidate site for a high-level waste repository. If Yucca Mountain is not licensed, DOE must seek further instructions from Congress. Additionally, the amendments authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility for spent fuel. The 1987 amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. If Yucca Mountain cannot be licensed, DOE must seek further instructions from Congress. The amendments also allowed for the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility for spent fuel, with restrictions to prevent it from becoming a de facto repository. The law prohibits the selection of a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) site until a permanent repository is recommended and Yucca Mountain receives a construction permit. The Obama Administration halted funding for Yucca Mountain and transferred responsibilities to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy in 2010. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred responsibilities to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy in 2010. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future developed a new waste management strategy and issued its final report in 2012, without evaluating specific sites like Yucca Mountain. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, stating that the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site has broken down. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing the breakdown of the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site. The new approach involves extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. Previous U.S. efforts to find voluntary waste sites had failed. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, involving extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. Previous U.S. efforts to find voluntary waste sites had failed, but the commission expressed confidence in the success of such a process, citing the example of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, involving negotiations with states and local governments. The commission highlighted the success of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico as an example. It suggested establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for the new waste management program. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for the new waste management program, independent from Administration control with assured access to funds. Administrative and legislative changes were suggested for the Nuclear Waste Fund to prioritize the waste management program. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a federal corporation for the waste management program with access to funds and oversight by Congress and the NRC. They called for the development of a permanent underground repository and interim storage facilities to address nuclear waste disposal needs. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a federal corporation for the waste management program with access to funds and oversight by Congress and the NRC. They called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim storage facilities to address nuclear waste disposal needs. The development of a permanent disposal site must be undertaken alongside the interim storage effort to prevent interim sites from becoming de facto permanent repositories. In response to the BRC report, DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a federal corporation for the waste management program with access to funds and oversight by Congress and the NRC. They called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim storage facilities. In response, DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in January 2013, outlining plans for interim storage facilities and a pilot facility by 2021. The DOE's strategy in January 2013 outlined plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, with a larger-scale facility opening by 2025. The strategy aimed to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository, but noted that current restrictions make it impossible to build the facility. The DOE's strategy in January 2013 outlined plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, with a larger-scale facility opening by 2025. The strategy aimed to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository, but noted that current restrictions make it impossible to build the facility. The DOE strategy recommended that the interim storage facility be linked to the development of a permanent repository to avoid it becoming a de facto repository. The strategy also suggested that a geologic disposal facility would open by 2048, 50 years after the initially planned opening date for the Yucca Mountain repository. The DOE strategy recommended a geologic disposal facility to open by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of design and licensing by 2042. The process for selecting sites for storage and disposal facilities was to be \"consent based,\" but few details were provided on its implementation. The DOE strategy recommended a geologic disposal facility to open by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of design and licensing by 2042. Sites for the proposed storage and disposal facilities would be selected through a \"consent based\" process, with few details on implementation provided. The Obama Administration would consult with Congress and interest groups on defining consent for the process. The Obama Administration's strategy for nuclear waste management involved consulting with Congress and interest groups to define consent for a new waste program. The proposed program would be implemented by a new nuclear waste management entity, with details on the organization not specified in the DOE strategy. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management program, with details on the organization not specified. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in Congress to modify the waste program along the lines of the Administration's strategy. Other proposals suggested privatizing waste management services. DOE recommended testing a consent-based approach by developing a repository solely for defense and research waste. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management program, with Senator Alexander introducing a bill to modify it. Other proposals suggested privatizing waste management services. DOE recommended testing a consent-based approach by developing a separate repository solely for defense and research waste, reversing the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both civilian and defense waste. The report suggests creating a separate repository for defense and research waste, diverging from the long-standing policy of a single repository for all high-level waste. This new approach could expedite development within existing legislative authority and potentially consider deep borehole disposal for compact waste types. The DOE's 2014 report recommended a separate repository for defense and research waste, which could be developed more quickly than a repository for all highly radioactive waste. President Obama authorized planning for an underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities in 2015. However, GAO criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in 2017. President Obama authorized DOE to plan a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities in 2015. GAO criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in 2017, leading to bills introduced to delay the plan. Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015 but other potential rail routes were still available. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, leading to bills introduced to delay the plan. Waste Control Specialists filed an application for an NRC license to develop a storage facility in Texas, citing high licensing costs. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for an NRC license to build a spent nuclear fuel storage facility in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the facility in June 2018. The proposed facility would be located at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility in Texas would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. It would consist of dry casks on concrete pads, with construction planned in eight phases. Each phase could hold 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel, totaling a capacity of 40,000 metric tons. Under the proposal, DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites and transport it to the Texas facility. The proposed radioactive waste storage facility in Texas would consist of dry casks on concrete pads, with construction planned in eight phases. Each phase could hold 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel, totaling a capacity of 40,000 metric tons. DOE would take title to the spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, transport it to the Texas site, and pay for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. The costs would be covered through appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund.

DOE would take title to the spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, transport it to the Texas site, and pay for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. An NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International. A new NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International on March 30, 2017. The facility would be located near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, on land provided by the Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA). Local officials have long supported additional waste facilities at the site, originally planned for high-level waste storage before the state objected. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico has local support for additional waste facilities. A presentation in 2012 outlined conditions for accepting high-level waste at the site, with Governor Susana Martinez expressing support in 2015. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico has local support for additional waste facilities. Governor Susana Martinez expressed support in 2015, but state senators oppose interim storage without a plan for permanent disposal. A 2014 radioactive release from WIPP could impact public support for expanded waste activities. Ernest Moniz, along with New Mexico's U.S. senators, oppose an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. The 2014 radioactive release from WIPP has also raised concerns about public support for expanded waste activities in the state. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been shown in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas, but it is unclear whether they would be developed by the private sector or the government. A bill (H.R. 474) aims to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa aims to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 is similar to previous legislation introduced in the 114th Congress. Under the bill, DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to the private storage facility. The bill H.R. 474, introduced by Representative Issa, allows DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors at private storage facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund can be used by DOE for interim storage without further congressional approval. The bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas.

Provisions for a private-sector MRS facility are included in bill H.R. 3053 approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on June 28, 2017. A private spent fuel storage facility was developed on tribal land in Utah by the Private Fuel Storage (PFS) consortium. A 20-year license for storing up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks was issued by the NRC on February 21, 2006, but Interior Department approval was also required. The Private Fuel Storage (PFS) consortium developed a storage facility on tribal land in Utah. A 20-year license for storing up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks was issued by the NRC on February 21, 2006. However, the Department of the Interior issued two decisions against the project on September 7, 2006. The Bureau of Indian Affairs disapproved a proposed lease of tribal trust lands to PFS due to the risk of waste remaining indefinitely, and the Bureau of Land Management rejected rights-of-way for waste transportation. On September 7, 2006, the Department of the Interior issued decisions against the PFS project. The Bureau of Indian Affairs disapproved a lease of tribal trust lands to PFS due to waste risks. The Bureau of Land Management rejected rights-of-way for waste transport, citing environmental concerns. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a lawsuit to challenge the Interior decisions, alleging political motives. The Department of the Interior rejected the PFS project due to environmental concerns and tribal trust land lease disapproval. A federal lawsuit was filed by the Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS, alleging political motives. The Interior was ordered to reconsider its decisions on PFS permits, but PFS later requested the termination of its license. The focus remains on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste disposal. The federal court ordered the Department of the Interior to reconsider PFS permits, but PFS later asked to terminate its license. The focus remains on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste disposal, with laws requiring NRC licensing and EPA standards for high-level waste repositories. The NWPA mandates NRC licensing and EPA standards for high-level waste repositories like Yucca Mountain. DOE shipments must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC and DOT regulations for transportation. Transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by NRC and DOT. DOE shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC and DOT regulations. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain require compliance with EPA standards and establish procedures for seeking a repository license. The NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain, at 10 C.F.R. 63, mandate compliance with EPA standards and establish procedures for obtaining a repository license. DOE must first obtain a construction authorization before being issued a license to bring nuclear waste to the site and place it underground. Additionally, there is a mandatory DOE repository performance confirmation program to ensure the proper functioning of natural and man-made systems. The NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include a mandatory DOE repository performance confirmation program to ensure systems are functioning as intended. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were required to meet radiation dose limits for public safety. The specific standards for Yucca Mountain were required to meet radiation dose limits for public safety, based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences recommended Yucca Mountain environmental standards to limit risk to individuals near the repository, rather than setting specific limits for radioactive material releases. EPA proposed radiation protection standards for Yucca Mountain in 1999. The NAS study recommended environmental standards for Yucca Mountain to limit risk to individuals near the repository. EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. EPA's standard aimed to result in a low annual risk of fatal cancer. The EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999 for Yucca Mountain, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as overly stringent, while environmental groups argued that the 10,000-year standard was too short. EPA's standard aimed to result in a low annual risk of fatal cancer. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, including a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite opposition from the DOE, the site suitability evaluation determined that the Yucca Mountain site was suitable. The final Yucca Mountain standards, issued by the EPA on June 6, 2001, included a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite DOE's opposition, the site suitability evaluation found Yucca Mountain suitable. The NRC revised its regulations on September 7, 2001, to align with the EPA standards. However, a U.S. Court of Appeals panel on July 9, 2004, struck down the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period in the EPA and NRC standards. The NRC revised its regulations on September 7, 2001, to align with the EPA standards. A U.S. Court of Appeals panel on July 9, 2004, struck down the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period in the EPA and NRC Yucca Mountain standards, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. The court found that the 10,000-year compliance period in the Yucca Mountain regulations was inconsistent with the NAS study. In response, EPA proposed new standards in 2005, retaining dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing a higher annual dose for the period of 10,000 years through 1 million years. EPA proposed new Yucca Mountain standards in 2005, keeping dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing a higher annual dose for 10,000 years through 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standard as too lenient. EPA issued a final rule in 2008, reducing the annual dose limit. EPA issued a final rule in 2008 amending Yucca Mountain standards, reducing the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standard as too lenient. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to align with new EPA standards in 2009, reducing the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance will now be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses, with the 4 millirem groundwater standard applying only to the first 10,000 years. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations in 2009 to align with new EPA standards, reducing the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for 10,000 through 1 million years. The 4 millirem groundwater standard will only apply to the first 10,000 years. DOE estimated in its June 2008 FSEIS for the Yucca Mountain repository that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems, significantly lower than previous estimates. The 2002 Final Environmental Impact Statement estimated peak doses of about 150 millirems after 400,000 years, but recent changes in DOE's computer model have reduced this to 2 millirems after 10,000 years. DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program focuses on improving spent nuclear fuel management. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including changes in computer models and assumptions. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposal included $88.5 million for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposal included $88.5 million for nuclear waste processing, but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's integrated waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management activities. The FY2019 budget request includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D and no funding for integrated waste management. The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on technology related to nuclear waste.

The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on technology related to reprocessing spent fuel. Nuclear utilities had paid fees to cover disposal costs until halted by a court. The R&D program focuses on technology for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. Nuclear utilities paid fees for disposal costs until halted by a court order in 2014. The Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017. $7.41 billion had been disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted after FY2010. The Yucca Mountain project for nuclear spent fuel was halted in 2014, with a balance of $37.2 billion in the Waste Fund by FY2017. $7.41 billion had been spent on the project before it was stopped in 2010. The estimated cost for the Yucca Mountain program was $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars. According to DOE's program summary report, $7.41 billion has been disbursed from the Waste Fund. The Yucca Mountain program was estimated to cost $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. The Yucca Mountain program cost $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. States can choose disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for waste disposal, with three commercial facilities authorized to refuse waste from outside their compacts after 1992. Under the 1985 amendments, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts after 1992. One site in Beatty, NV, closed, leaving two sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, to prohibit waste from outside their compacts. Utah's site is available nationwide for Class A waste, while Class B and C waste must be stored where generated. The Beatty, NV site closed, leaving two sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, to prohibit waste from outside their compacts. Utah's site is available nationwide for Class A waste, while a new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, may alleviate the storage problem for Class B and C waste. A new disposal facility for Class A, B, and C low-level waste near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues. The facility can serve Texas and Vermont primarily but may allocate up to 30% of its capacity to waste from other states. Legislation for the Texas compact, including Maine and Vermont, was signed in 1998. The Texas site received its first waste shipment from Vermont in 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact, originally including Maine and Vermont, was signed in 1998. Governor Rick Perry authorized the licensing of disposal facilities for low-level waste in 2003. The Texas site near Sierra Blanca, TX, was rejected by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, and Maine subsequently withdrew. Texas Governor Rick Perry signed legislation in 2003 authorizing the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to license disposal facilities for low-level waste. An application to build the Andrews County disposal facility was filed in 2004 by Waste Control Specialists LLC. TCEQ issued the license in 2009 and approved construction in 2011. The disposal facility at Barnwell, SC, is currently accepting all Class A, B waste. The Andrews County disposal facility application was filed in 2004 by Waste Control Specialists LLC, and the license was issued by TCEQ in 2009. The Barnwell disposal facility in SC is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes South Carolina, Connecticut, and New Jersey. South Carolina can limit the use of the facility to compact members only. South Carolina is accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes Connecticut and New Jersey. The state can limit the use of the Barnwell facility to compact members only, with a law phasing out acceptance of noncompact waste by 2008. The facility had previously stopped accepting waste from outside the Southeast Compact in 1994. The Barnwell facility phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by June 30, 2008. South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1995 and began accepting waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in July 1999. The South Carolina General Assembly voted in 1995 to withdraw from the Southeast Compact and accept waste at Barnwell from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in July 1999, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that this withdrawal did not subject North Carolina to sanctions. The only other disposal facility for low-level waste is in Hanford, WA, controlled by the Northwest Compact. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact did not result in sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other disposal facility for low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities is overseen by the NRC or by \"agreement states\" with approved regulatory programs. NRC regulations for low-level waste licenses must adhere to environmental and radiation protection standards. The NRC regulates licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities under the Atomic Energy Act. NRC regulations for waste licenses must meet environmental and radiation protection standards. Transportation of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to its disposal regulations in 2015 and submitted final regulations for approval in 2016. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015 and submitted final regulations for approval in 2016. The commission issued further revisions in 2017, including establishing time periods for technical analyses of waste sites to ensure public protection. The NRC issued revisions in 2017 to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites for public protection. Analysis must be done for a 1,000-year compliance period if no significant radioactive material is present, and for a 10,000-year period if significant quantities are present. The NRC's current low-level waste regulations, adopted in 1982, require technical analysis for a 1,000-year compliance period if no significant radioactive material is present at a disposal site, and for a 10,000-year period if significant quantities are present. Post-10,000-year analysis may be needed in certain cases, along with new technical analysis to protect inadvertent intruders at low-level waste sites. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, as without a national waste management system, spent fuel from nuclear power plants must be stored on-site indefinitely. A new technical analysis is required to protect inadvertent intruders at low-level waste sites. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, especially with the need for on-site storage of spent fuel from nuclear power plants. Concerns about spent fuel storage safety have been heightened by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in March 2011. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is under current law. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama's actions to terminate the project have halted most activities in the DOE waste program. Congress is debating the project's future, especially in light of concerns about spent fuel storage safety heightened by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in March 2011. The government's nuclear waste disposal policy at Yucca Mountain was halted by President Obama, leading to a debate in Congress. The NRC found the site viable, and the Trump Administration proposed restarting licensing. Senator Reid's retirement also impacted the project's future. The NRC found Yucca Mountain site viable for nuclear waste disposal. The Trump Administration proposed restarting licensing, impacting legislative action in Congress. Senator Reid's retirement also affects the project's future. The retirement of Senator Reid, a strong opponent of the Yucca Mountain project, may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Trump Administration requested $120 million for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage in FY2018 to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. Despite not being approved for FY2018, the funding request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE are likely to seek damages from the federal government. The Trump Administration has requested funding for Yucca Mountain to address nuclear waste, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. The funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE may seek damages from the federal government if disposal delays continue, potentially costing up to $34.1 billion in liabilities. The nuclear industry may seek damages from the federal government for disposal delays, with potential liabilities totaling $34.1 billion. Lack of a waste disposal system could impact licensing for new nuclear plants. Future damages could increase by tens of billions if the disposal program fails. The nuclear industry may seek damages from the federal government for disposal delays, with potential liabilities totaling $34.1 billion, including the $6.9 billion already paid to Exelon and other utilities. Future damages could rise by tens of billions more if the disposal program fails. Lack of a waste disposal system could affect licensing for new nuclear plants and force DOE to miss compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed problems created by disposal delays in its final report, suggesting options like centralized interim storage. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed nuclear waste disposal delays in its final report, recommending options like centralized interim storage and the establishment of a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage and disposal facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options for nuclear waste disposal, including centralized interim storage and the establishment of a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste facilities. Delays in the nuclear waste program suggest longer on-site storage is likely under any option. The \"consent based\" siting process proposed by the Commission may be authorized by the Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options for nuclear waste disposal, including centralized interim storage and the establishment of a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste facilities. The ongoing shutdown of the nuclear waste program suggests longer on-site storage is almost certain. The \"consent based\" siting process recommended by the Commission has attracted serious interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas, but previous voluntary siting efforts were ultimately blocked by the governments of potential host states. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, along with other legislation, has sparked interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Previous voluntary siting efforts faced challenges from potential host states, highlighting the importance of state cooperation for any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort. The success of any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort for nuclear waste disposal will depend on the cooperation of potential host states. Relevant reports and studies on current nuclear waste issues are available from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, the Government Accountability Office, and Harvard University. Reports on current nuclear waste issues are available from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, the Government Accountability Office, Harvard University, and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. The curr_chunk discusses the economics of reprocessing vs. direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel, as well as technical issues associated with the development of a separate repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. It includes references to reports from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. The curr_chunk provides references to reports from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board on the management of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in the United States and other countries. References to reports from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board on managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in the US and other countries are available online from various sources like the RAND Corporation and the University of Illinois. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and strategies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including a draft consent-based siting process for storage and disposal facilities. It provides links to resources from the RAND Corporation, University of Illinois, and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Department of Energy released a draft consent-based siting process for storage and disposal facilities for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste in January 2017. Additionally, there was an assessment of disposal options for DOE-managed high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in October 2014, and a strategy for the management and disposal of used nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in January 2013. Assessment of Disposal Options for DOE-Managed High-Level Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel was conducted in October 2014. Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste was outlined in January 2013. Used Fuel Disposition Campaign focused on Disposal Research and Development Roadmap in March 2011. The curr_chunk provides references to documents related to the disposal of high-level radioactive waste, including the Disposal Research and Development Roadmap and Safety Evaluation Report for a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The book \"Waste of a Mountain: How Yucca Mountain Was Selected, Studied, and Dumped\" by Voegele and Vieth is also mentioned. The curr_chunk provides references to documents related to the disposal of high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. It includes the Safety Evaluation Report for a geologic repository and books such as \"Waste of a Mountain\" by Voegele and Vieth, and \"The Road to Yucca Mountain\" by Walker."
