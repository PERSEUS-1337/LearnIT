    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and increased cost sharing. Prior to the enactment of federal mental health parity laws, health plans imposed lower limits and fewer services for mental health coverage compared to medical and surgical services. Mental health parity aims to address this insurance coverage disparity by ensuring equal coverage for mental health services. Mental health parity addresses the disparity in insurance coverage by ensuring equal coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical services. Policymakers have developed approaches to achieve parity, mandating coverage and requiring equal coverage for mental health services. Coverage for mental health services should be offered on par with medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed three approaches to achieving parity, based on coverage mandates and parity requirements. Full parity approach policies mandate coverage for mental illnesses and require parity coverage, while other policies mandate coverage but do not require parity. Federal mental health parity laws may require insurers to cover certain mental illnesses with mandated coverage and parity requirements. Different approaches include full parity, minimum mandated benefit, and mandated offering parity. The federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA followed a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA contains provisions related to federal mental health parity laws, which require insurers to cover mental health and substance abuse disorders in compliance with parity requirements. The previous federal mental health parity law followed a mandated offering parity approach, not mandating coverage of specific services but requiring compliance with parity requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services when insurers choose to cover both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level, but contains provisions that expand the applicability of federal mental health parity requirements to certain plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by extending them to specific financing arrangements. It builds upon existing laws like MHPA and MHPAEA, which establish federal parity requirements for mental health coverage. These laws focus on parity in limits and treatment requirements, rather than mandating coverage for specific mental health conditions. The MHPA and MHPAEA laws require parity in mental health coverage, including limits, treatment requirements, and financial aspects. Employers have adjusted benefits in response to MHPAEA, with some choosing to drop coverage. Recent data shows that some employers have modified their benefits in response to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). While a small percentage have chosen to drop coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, the majority have instead removed coverage limits or increased utilization management. The Affordable Care Act also mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. Some employers have adjusted benefits in response to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). While a few have opted to eliminate coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, most have removed coverage limits or increased utilization management. The Affordable Care Act also requires coverage for these services. The impact of these requirements on plans' decisions regarding coverage in 2014 remains uncertain. MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) and the Affordable Care Act require coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services by certain plans. The impact of these requirements on plans' decisions regarding coverage in 2014 remains uncertain. MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) mandates that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health services must be no less than those for medical and surgical services under group health plans. It amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) requires mental health coverage to be on par with medical and surgical services under group health plans. It amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements, with exemptions for small employers and cost increases. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) establishes exemptions for small employers with 2-50 employees and cost increases of at least 1% from federal mental health parity requirements. MHPA received annual extensions until 2008 and was further expanded by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) to include substance use. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expanded federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders. It mandates parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits, amending the small employer exemption to include employers with only one employee seeking group coverage. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders. It mandates parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits, amending the small employer exemption to include employers with only one employee seeking group coverage. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and mandates parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. It also amends the small employer exemption to include employers with only one employee seeking group insurance. Prior to the ACA, federal mental health parity requirements were codified at PHSA Section 2705. Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP plans covering mental health services had to comply with some federal parity requirements. Medicare, including fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage plans, was not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA expanded mental health parity provisions. The ACA expanded federal mental health parity requirements to mandate coverage of certain mental health services by specific plan types, extending the applicability of these provisions. Medicare, including fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage plans, is not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include coverage of specified mental health services by certain plan types, such as qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Plans offered through the individual market must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, with a small employer exemption still in effect. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Plans offered through the individual market must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, with a small employer exemption still in effect. Starting in 2014, QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services and comply with federal parity laws. The interaction between these requirements and the small employer exemption may need to be addressed through rulemaking. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Plans offered through the individual market must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, with a small employer exemption still in effect. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must offer mental health services in compliance with federal parity laws. The ACA did not change the applicability of parity requirements for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The ACA mandates compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans offering mental health services. It also requires coverage of specific mental health services for QHPs, new plans in the individual and small group markets. The applicability of parity requirements to CHIP plans remains unchanged. The application of federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans is explained in detail, as required by law prior to the ACA. The ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The main considerations for mental health and substance abuse services coverage are the existence of a mandate and parity with medical or surgical services. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in individual and small group markets. The main considerations are the existence of a coverage mandate and parity with medical or surgical services. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in individual and small group markets. It establishes essential health benefits and defines QHPs in Section 1301. The ACA mandates coverage of essential health benefits for various plan types, including QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It defines QHPs in Section 1301 and requires them to provide a specific set of benefits outlined in Section 1302(b). QHPs must offer essential health benefits, including mental health and substance abuse services, as outlined in ACA Section 1302(b). The ACA Section 1302(b) requires Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to offer essential health benefits, including mental health and substance abuse services. These services are part of the 10 general categories outlined in the statute, but the specific coverage within these categories is determined through the rulemaking process. The statute does not mandate coverage for specific services but requires coverage for services in all 10 broad categories. The ACA mandates coverage for essential health benefits in all 10 broad categories, with specific services defined through the rulemaking process. The EHBP must be equivalent to benefits provided by typical employer plans, and all Medicaid benchmark plans must offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014. The ACA mandates coverage for essential health benefits in all 10 broad categories, with specific services defined through the rulemaking process. Medicaid benchmark plans must offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014, and new plans in individual and small group markets must include EHB coverage by the same date. These provisions do not create a federal mandate for mental health services but have a combined effect. The ACA mandates coverage of essential health benefits by January 1, 2014, including mental health services for new plans in individual and small group markets. Some states also require coverage of certain mental health conditions through parity laws. The ACA mandates coverage of essential health benefits, including mental health services, by January 1, 2014. Some states also require coverage of specific mental health conditions through parity laws. ACA Section 1311(d)(3) allows states to require additional benefits in Qualified Health Plans, but the state must bear the cost of these extra benefits. ACA Section 1311(d)(3) allows states to require additional benefits in Qualified Health Plans, with the state bearing the cost. Requiring coverage of mental health and substance abuse services is separate from parity coverage. The ACA allows states to require additional benefits in Qualified Health Plans, with the state covering the cost. This includes mental health and substance abuse services. ACA Section 1311(j) mandates federal mental health parity requirements for all QHPs offered through the Exchanges. ACA Section 1311(j) mandates federal mental health parity requirements for all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through the Exchanges, ensuring equal coverage. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate due to risk pooling advantages for small group and individual plans. Small employers are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements, impacting some plans offered through the Exchanges. Small group plans may have less incentive to participate in the Exchange starting in 2017 due to the risk pooling advantage for enrollees. The exemption of small employers from federal mental health parity requirements could impact plans offered through the Exchange. The interaction between ACA Section 1311(j) and the small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law is discussed further. The ACA Section 1311(j) may impact plans offered through the Exchange. The small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law applies to small employers with 2 to 50 employees and extends to states where the definition includes self-employed individuals. The small employer exemption under the federal mental health parity law applies to employers with 2 to 50 employees and includes self-employed individuals in states where the definition applies. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market, replacing references to group health plans with language that includes both group and individual health insurance coverage. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market by including both group and individual health insurance coverage. The small employer exemption under the law remains unclear after the ACA conforming amendment. The ACA conforming amendment extends federal mental health parity requirements to plans in the individual market, but it is unclear if the small employer exemption has been removed. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may remain in effect for small employers with 1 employee in certain states. The definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include employers with one employee. Based on amended statutory language, the small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply to employers with 1 employee in certain states. The definition of \"small employer\" has been broadened to include those with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees, expanding the range of eligible employers. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law now applies to employers with 1 to 100 employees, expanding eligibility. States have the option to use the previous definition of small employer until 2016, potentially raising questions about self-employed individuals. Until 2016, states can choose to use the old definition of small employer for plans offered through an Exchange, potentially causing confusion regarding federal mental health parity requirements for individuals seeking coverage on the individual market. The language in question raises concerns about whether plans offered to individuals in the individual market must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, unlike plans offered to individuals seeking group coverage as employers. There is also a question about whether small employer QHPs may be exempt from these requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). Small employer QHPs may be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under ACA Section 1311(j), which applies PHSA Section 2726 to qualified health plans. The ACA does not clarify if the small employer exemption applies to QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. The ACA does not specify if the small employer exemption for federal mental health parity requirements applies to qualified health plans (QHPs) in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. Medicaid can be offered through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, including Medicaid managed care plans. Prior to the ACA, federal law required all Medicaid managed care plans to comply with federal mental health parity requirements. This applies to plans offering medical, surgical, mental health, or substance use disorder benefits through traditional Medicaid or benchmark coverage. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include both traditional Medicaid managed care plans and Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans, which must comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. ACA Section 2001 requires Medicaid plans to comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Treatment limitations include limits on treatment frequency, visits, coverage days, or duration. Financial requirements cover deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket expenses, excluding lifetime and annual limits. Plans offering EPSDT services meet the parity requirement. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans are not required to comply with federal parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. Plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans, not Medicaid managed care plans, are not required to comply with federal parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits, per ACA Section 2001(c). Medicaid managed care plans must comply with all federal mental health parity requirements. Plans offered under traditional Medicaid may not be required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if these requirements extend to non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid. The federal mental health parity requirements may not extend to non-managed care plans offered under traditional Medicaid. It is uncertain how requiring all types of Medicaid plans to adhere to these requirements, while deeming plans offering EPSDT services as compliant, will impact coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees. ACA Section 2001(a)(2)(A) and Section 2001(c) expand the compliance requirement for certain federal mental health regulations. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The impact of deeming plans offering EPSDT services as compliant on coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees is uncertain. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The CHIP statute already includes provisions for mental health parity in CHIP plans, but may need to be updated to align with ACA changes. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The CHIP statute already includes provisions for mental health parity in CHIP plans, but may need to be updated to align with ACA changes, specifically in conforming existing statutory provisions in SSA Title XXI. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid populations up to 133% of the federal poverty level. CHIP plans may need to be updated to align with ACA changes in conforming existing statutory provisions in SSA Title XXI. SSA Section 2103(c)(6) requires compliance with PHSA Section 2705 for mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits in state child health plans. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid populations up to 133% of the federal poverty level. CHIP plans that offer EPSDT services are deemed to satisfy the parity requirement, but it is unclear if this fulfills compliance with the full set of parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid populations up to 133% of the federal poverty level. CHIP plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to satisfy the parity requirement, but it is uncertain if this meets compliance with the full set of parity requirements under SSA Section 2103(f)(2). The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid populations up to 133% of the federal poverty level. CHIP plans must comply with all federal mental health parity requirements, including those outlined in SSA Section 2103(f)(2) and Title XXVII of the PHSA. This represents an expansion of the requirements established by MHPA and MHPAEA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, extending coverage to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. This includes a mandate for coverage of specific mental health services determined through rulemaking. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types, creating a mandate for coverage of specific mental health services determined through rulemaking. This represents a significant change from federal law prior to the ACA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types, creating a mandate for coverage of specific mental health services determined through rulemaking. This represents a significant change from federal law prior to the ACA. Federal mental health parity requirements are extended to all qualified health plans, as established by the ACA, with questions raised about how small employer plans in the Exchange may be affected. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to all qualified health plans, including small employer plans in the Exchange. Some federal mental health parity requirements apply to Medicaid non-managed care plans, but it is unclear if they extend to traditional Medicaid plans. The CHIP statute includes two parity-related provisions with varying reach. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to all qualified health plans, including small employer plans in the Exchange. Some federal mental health parity requirements apply to Medicaid non-managed care plans, but it is unclear if they extend to traditional Medicaid plans. The CHIP statute contains two separate parity-related provisions with varying reach, one more limited and the other applying requirements in their entirety to CHIP plans."
