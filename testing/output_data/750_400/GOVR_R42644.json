The proposed FY2013 appropriations bills had parallel components but some differences in subcomponents and accounts. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The FY2013 appropriations bills had parallel components but some differences in subcomponents and accounts. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The congressional budget process involves setting overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, followed by allocating these amounts among the appropriations committees. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary funds available for enactment in annual appropriations bills through subcommittees. Appropriations committees then allocate these funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill. The congressional budget process involves setting overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary funds available for enactment in annual appropriations bills through subcommittees. Appropriations committees then allocate these funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. The 302(b) allocations are funds allocated by the Appropriations Committee for each appropriations bill, based on the 302(a) discretionary allocation. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first affected by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year as appropriations bills progress towards final enactment. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which established spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. The Act set separate caps for security spending, including the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, international affairs programs, and the National Nuclear Security Administration. Adjustments to allocations can be made by the Appropriations Committee as bills progress towards enactment. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending in FY2013. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments can be made to cover funding for overseas contingency operations. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending in FY2013. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and controlling health care fraud and abuse. These levels became the basis for enforcement in the Senate and the House. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security spending. Adjustments were allowed for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud and abuse. These levels were used for enforcement in the Senate and the House. The House-passed budget resolution set spending levels for enforcement, triggering automatic spending reductions under the Budget Control Act. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to enact deficit reduction legislation by January 15, 2012, leading to sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013. The process required the Office of Management and Budget to implement the reductions. The failure to enact deficit reduction legislation by January 15, 2012, triggered automatic spending reductions under the Budget Control Act. This process involved sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013, with the Office of Management and Budget implementing across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implemented across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from defense and nondefense funding as required by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended by the Budget Control Act (BCA). The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made significant changes to the procedures in the BCA that took effect in FY2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) for FY2013. The joint committee sequester implementation was delayed to March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction. Statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014 were lowered.

President Obama ordered the joint committee sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with budget cuts at the program, project, and activity level within each account. The reductions were calculated on an annualized basis and will be apportioned throughout the fiscal year. The post-sequestration numbers are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan. Sequestration was implemented during a temporary continuing resolution, with reductions calculated annually and apportioned throughout the fiscal year. The post-sequestration numbers in this report are from the FY2013 DHS operating plan, which only includes resources from P.L. 113-6. It does not address sequestration of resources in P.L. 113-2. Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to eliminate any excess budget authority provided in the act for FY2013 discretionary spending. Section 3001 of P.L. 113-6 aims to eliminate any excess budget authority provided in the act for FY2013 discretionary spending, with two separate across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority. The FY2013 discretionary spending limits are exceeded by the act, with two across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and receives a 0.1% cut to align with the spending limits. Section 3004 of the bill includes two separate across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS falls under the security category and receives a 0.1% cut at the program, project, and activity level. The Office of Management and Budget has the final say on exceeding spending limits. Section 3004 of the bill includes two separate across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget is the final arbiter of whether spending limits have been exceeded. OMB calculated additional rescissions of 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority would be required post-enactment of P.L. 113-6. The section requires increased percentages for rescissions if OMB estimates additional cuts are needed to stay within spending limits. OMB calculated post-enactment of P.L. 113-6 that 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority would need to be rescinded. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are exempt from these cuts. The cuts in discretionary budget authority do not apply to funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013 are shown in Table 2, along with figures for FY2012 and the President's request for FY2013. Justifications outlined in the BCA have influenced adjustments to discretionary budget authority caps. Table 2 displays DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013, FY2012, and the President's FY2013 request. Justifications from the Budget Control Act have impacted adjustments to discretionary budget authority caps, including emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief.

The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with amendments including adding funds for CBP salaries and expenses, communications infrastructure, and cutting the BSFIT appropriation. $624,000 was added to the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction's Operations, Maintenance and Procurement account. The Senate-reported bill included $11,971 in gross budget authority, representing a $319 million increase over last year's appropriation. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 included $11,971 in gross budget authority, a $319 million increase over last year's appropriation. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP, an increase of $201 million from last year's appropriation. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) allocated $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, a slight increase from last year's appropriation. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by approximately $575 million, resulting in projected total spending of $11,298 million for FY2013. The FY2013 budget for CBP saw a $98 million decrease from the previous year's appropriation and a $222 million increase over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by approximately $575 million. Policy issues during the appropriations cycle included concerns about US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. The FY2013 budget for CBP was $353 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. Policy issues included US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated an automated entry-exit data system for aliens in 1996. The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was mandated by Congress in 1996 to implement an automated entry and exit data system for aliens. This system tracks the arrival and departure of foreign visitors to and from the United States by collecting and storing biographic and biometric identification information about them. The system tracks entry and exit of foreign visitors to the United States by collecting and storing biographic and biometric identification information. This data is shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. The Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) database and biometric data are stored in the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) database. This information is shared with government agencies to identify potential risks. The entry-exit system has been operational at U.S. ports of entry since December 2006, requiring most non-citizens to provide biometric data when entering the United States. Non-citizens exiting the United States are not required to provide biometric data. The U.S. entry-exit system, operational since December 2006, requires most non-citizens to provide biometric data when entering the country. However, biometric data is not collected from non-citizens exiting the U.S. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program. The U.S. entry-exit system requires biometric data from non-citizens entering the country, but not when exiting. The President's FY2013 budget did not fund a biometric exit system, focusing on an enhanced biographic exit program instead. DHS collects biographic data from passengers exiting through air and sea ports, identifying overstays through passenger manifest data. The enhanced biographic exit program collects passenger manifest data from air and sea carriers to identify overstays and flag high-priority individuals for follow-up investigations. The integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system involves sharing biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada through land ports of entry on the Canadian border with DHS. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the lack of a biometric exit system implementation. Both chambers' appropriations reports have directed DHS to report on plans for a comprehensive exit system. The entry-exit system's role in DHS involves sharing biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada with the U.S. for exit tracking purposes. The U.S. entry-exit system, previously known as the US-VISIT Program, has faced organizational changes within DHS. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the lack of a biometric exit system implementation and have directed DHS to report on plans for a comprehensive exit system. The U.S. entry-exit system, formerly known as the US-VISIT Program, has undergone organizational changes within DHS. It was initially coordinated under the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security (BTS) and later proposed to be placed within a new Screening Coordination Office (SCO) by former DHS Secretary Chertoff. However, funding for the SCO was never allocated, leading to US-VISIT operating independently. In a reorganization by former DHS Secretary Chertoff, US-VISIT was moved from BTS to a proposed Screening Coordination Office (SCO) that never received funding. US-VISIT operated independently before being transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) in FY2008. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies. In FY2006, US-VISIT became a stand-alone office within DHS. In FY2008, it was transferred to NPPD. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for efficiency. Congress did not fully support the proposed move. The House and Senate had differing opinions on the proposed transfer of US-VISIT funding. The House bill would transfer $73 million to CBP and ICE, while leaving $191 million within a new Office of Biometric Identity Management. The Senate bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation. The Senate recommended transferring US-VISIT funding of $191 million to a new Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD, rather than incorporating it within CBP as the President had requested. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management under P.L. 113-6. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the requested staffing levels for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents in the President's FY2013 budget. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management under P.L. 113-6. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, with questions raised about how DHS sets staffing levels. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if high staffing levels are maintained during budget tightening and expressed concern about stagnant inspection fees limiting funds for CBP officers. The Senate and House reports raised concerns about DHS staffing levels and funding for CBP officers. They suggested reengineering processes, improving risk-based targeting, managing staffing surges, exploring partnerships, and expanding trusted trade programs. The House report suggested various changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs, including process reengineering, risk-based targeting, managing staffing surges, exploring partnerships, expanding trusted programs, and utilizing technology to increase officer efficiency. The report also called for specific staffing and deployment plans for border patrol agents, while the Senate report requested a plan for OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry. The House and Senate reports recommended reducing staffing requirements at ports of entry through process reengineering, risk-based targeting, partnerships, trusted programs, and technology. The reports also called for specific staffing plans for border patrol agents and OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry. CBP officer salaries are partially funded by user fees, and efforts to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues may impact staffing levels. Some Members may oppose reducing CBP staffing. About 37% of CBP officer salaries are funded by user fees, with efforts to refine forecasting for adequate budgeting. Border patrol staffing has increased significantly since FY2005, but OFO staffing at POEs has only seen an 18% increase despite expanded responsibilities. Some may disagree with reducing CBP staffing levels. Increased border patrol staffing by 90% since FY2005, while OFO staffing at POEs has only increased by 18%. Some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to more illegal migrants and drug smugglers entering through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing believe officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions better than automated systems. Increased enforcement between ports of entry has encouraged illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing argue that officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions better than automated systems. Sequestration in 2013 led to warnings of furloughs, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring for frontline CBP personnel. With the implementation of sequestration on March 1, 2013, DHS officials warned of potential furloughs, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring for frontline CBP personnel. The impact could result in the equivalent of cuts to over 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 2,750 CBP officers. DHS plans to minimize the impact by eliminating employee performance awards, reducing outside contracts, limiting administrative expenditures, and working with congressional appropriators to reprogram funds. DHS plans to minimize the impact of sequestration on frontline operations by cutting employee performance awards, reducing outside contracts, limiting administrative expenditures, and reprogramming funds. CBP intends to rely on reductions to overtime and hiring freezes to avoid employee furloughs. CBP officials plan to reprogram funds and reduce overtime and hiring to avoid employee furloughs. With a significant portion of the budget allocated to salaries and benefits, frontline staffing may see reduced hours and furlough days. Specific plans for this had not been announced at the time of the report. The administration is considering reducing overtime hours and implementing furlough days for CBP frontline staffing due to budget constraints. Public-private partnerships are being explored as a potential funding source for staffing and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry, despite legal restrictions on fee-for-service immigration and customs services. The administration is exploring public-private partnerships as a funding source for staffing and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013 to reimburse for additional services, officer overtime, new facilities, and expansion of services at land ports. CBP can enter into up to five public-private partnerships in FY2013 to allow reimbursement for additional services, officer overtime, new facilities, and service expansion at land ports. User fees, including COBRA fees, are collected from passengers, cargo carriers, and importers for customs services. CBP collects various user fees, including COBRA fees, to fund customs services such as overtime compensation, benefits for officers, preclearance services, and language proficiency awards. These fees are mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272), certain fees directly reimburse CBP for customs functions like overtime compensation, benefits, and premium pay for officers, preclearance services, and language proficiency awards. Merchandise processing fees go to CBP's Customs User Fee Account for additional revenue functions, subject to appropriations acts. Certain COBRA fees, including merchandise processing fees, are used to pay for customs functions like overtime compensation, benefits, and premium pay for officers. Some COBRA passenger fees have been collected without a corresponding appropriation for customs functions, drawing Congressional interest. Certain COBRA passenger fees have been collected and deposited in the Customs User Fee Account without a corresponding appropriation to pay for customs functions. Congressional interest has been drawn due to two recent examples of this, including the temporary fee increase under the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011. The United States implemented temporary fee increases for passengers from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands, resulting in the collection of $639 million from FY1994-FY1997. The United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 eliminated passenger fee exemptions for travelers from Mexico, Canada, and other Western Hemisphere states, leading to an estimated increase in COBRA fees of $83 million in FY2012 and $110 million in FY2013 onwards. These funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account. The Implementation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-42) removed passenger fee exemptions for travelers from Mexico, Canada, and other Western Hemisphere states, resulting in increased COBRA fees. The funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not yet been used for customs revenue collection. Some Members of Congress have questioned the use of these fees. The funds from increased COBRA fees under P.L. 112-42 are directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not been obligated for customs revenue collection. Questions have been raised by Members of Congress about the use of these fees. The House Appropriations Committee has requested CBP to report on access to the $639 million identified by GAO and how to eliminate these funds from its books. CBP's budget justification for FY2013 included these fees in its budget. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on access to $639 million identified by GAO and how to eliminate those funds from its books. CBP's budget for FY2013 included fees from P.L. 112-42, but there was a shortfall as the funds were not made available to CBP. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to officer salaries to address the shortfall. The House and Senate did not include language in their appropriation bills to make funds available to CBP for officer salaries, resulting in a shortfall. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to address the shortfall, while the Senate awaited a resolution from the department. P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million to make up for the budget shortfall in CBP salaries. The Senate report awaited a resolution to the shortfall in CBP salaries, with P.L. 113-6 appropriating an additional $110 million to address the budget gap. DHS' strategy for controlling the Southwest Border involves using technology to monitor and detect illegal entries. Since 1998, DHS has tried to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors for surveillance along key stretches of the Southwest Border, but previous initiatives have not met desired surveillance levels. The Naturalization Service has attempted to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors linked to an integrated computer system for \"situational awareness\" along key stretches of the border. Previous surveillance programs like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for contracting practices, oversight issues, and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan in January 2011, focusing on rapid deployment of existing technology. The America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for non-competitive contracting practices, inadequate oversight, and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan in January 2011, emphasizing the rapid deployment of existing technology. House and Senate appropriations reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new plan. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for not procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment as part of the Arizona Border Technology Plan. Senate report raised concerns about the premature call for proposals to use SBI net technology along the Arizona border. The House and Senate criticized CBP for not procuring new surveillance equipment for the Arizona Border Technology Plan. Both chambers recommended fully funding the BSFIT account but also recommended rescinding unobligated balances, with the House calling for $40,412,000 in rescissions and the Senate calling for $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 includes $73,232,000. Both chambers recommended fully funding the President's request for the BSFIT account, but also suggested rescinding unobligated balances. The House proposed $40,412,000 in rescissions, while the Senate proposed $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP utilizes manned and unmanned aircraft for border surveillance, with the President's FY2013 budget supporting 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and surveillance. CBP relies on manned and unmanned aircraft for border surveillance. The President's FY2013 budget supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and surveillance, with $3 million allocated for the \"Big Pipe\" project. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. The President's FY2013 budget supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and surveillance, with $3 million allocated for the \"Big Pipe\" project. CBP operated a total of 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as of November 2012, with UAS accounting for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support the use of aircraft for border surveillance, including UAS in particular. In November 2012, CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for border surveillance, with UAS accounting for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support the use of UAS for border security, but there are concerns about privacy and cost effectiveness. A May 2012 DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for lacking proper planning. The use of UAS in border security is controversial due to privacy concerns and questions about cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for inadequate planning and support resources. Both appropriations committees recommended budget increases for OAM, with the House suggesting $82,700,000 and the Senate suggesting $70,997,000. The planning process for UAS systems lacks support resources, leading to under-utilization of assets. Both House and Senate appropriations committees recommended budget increases for OAM, with the House suggesting $82,700,000 and the Senate suggesting $70,997,000. P.L. 113-6 allocated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. The House and Senate recommended budget increases for OAM, with the House suggesting $82,700,000 and the Senate suggesting $70,997,000. P.L. 113-6 allocated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is responsible for screening cargo passing through U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. CBP is responsible for screening cargo passing through U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials, including using radiation detection and nonintrusive inspection imaging scanners. Legislation such as the SAFE Port Act and the 9/11 Act have established requirements for cargo screening. CBP must ensure all maritime cargo is scanned through radiation detection and nonintrusive inspection imaging scanners before being loaded on ships bound for the United States. The 9/11 Act established a deadline for DHS to begin excluding cargo not scanned by July 1, 2012, with the option to extend the deadline under certain circumstances. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano notified Congress in May 2012 of her decision to extend the 100% scanning deadline, raising questions about balancing security benefits. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% scanning deadline for U.S.-bound cargo in May 2012, citing concerns about balancing security benefits with costs. Arguments have been made to focus scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample. The Department of Homeland Security is considering how to balance the security benefits of scanning U.S.-bound cargo with the costs involved, such as increased paperwork, maintenance of scanning technology, and longer wait times for importers. They are looking to focus scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make the best use of resources. The Department of Homeland Security is considering balancing security benefits of scanning U.S.-bound cargo with costs by focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make the best use of resources. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to screening programs for security threats. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and $78 million in proposed increases to screening programs for security threats. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported the President's request for these programs, acknowledging concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws within the United States. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported the President's request for programs related to immigration and customs enforcement. They acknowledged concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports and called on DHS to propose an alternative plan. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States, including investigating violations such as alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring. ICE also locates and removes aliens who have overstayed their visas or entered the country illegally. ICE is responsible for enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States, investigating violations like alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring, locating and removing overstayed visa holders and illegal entrants. They also combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws. See Table 8 for more agency details. ICE enforces immigration and customs laws, investigates violations like alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring, and removes overstayed visa holders and illegal entrants. They also combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws. Funding numbers for ICE reflect spending cuts relative to previous years. For ICE sub-account level detail, funding for FY2012 and FY2013 is shown in Table 10. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 reflects spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts. The Administration requested $5,332 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. The Administration requested $5,332 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012, with additional spending cuts required by sequestration. The budget request included an increase of $40 million for the Alternatives to Detention program and $6 million for personnel consolidation. The Administration requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million (3.7%) from FY2012. The budget included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel consolidation, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program overstay analysis function. In FY2013, ICE requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. The budget included increases for personnel consolidation, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program overstay analysis function. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have given $5,474 million in net budget, with reductions in funding for the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. ICE requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority for FY2013, with reductions in funding for various programs including the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided ICE with $5,474 million in net budget authority, representing a decrease of $77 million (1.4%) from the FY2012 enacted level. The House-passed H.R. 5855 and Senate-Reported S. 3216 proposed different funding levels for ICE in FY2013. The House bill would have allocated $5,786 million, a 1.3% decrease from FY2012, while the Senate recommended $5,330 million, a decrease of less than 0.1% from the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a net budget authority of $5,330 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of less than 0.1% from the Administration's request and a 4.0% decrease from FY2012 enacted levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a net budget authority of $5,330 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $220 million (4.0%) from the FY2012 enacted amount. Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed $5,642 million for ICE, a decrease of $220 million (3.8%) from FY2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,426 million for ICE, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from the previous year's appropriation. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE for FY2013, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from last year's appropriation. Sequestration further reduced ICE budget authority by roughly an additional $200 million. ICE's budget for FY2013 saw a decrease of $125 million (2.1%) from the previous year's appropriation, with a slight increase of $94 million (1.5%) over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by approximately $200 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for ICE to be $5,442 million, $420 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. ICE faces challenges in allocating resources effectively due to the wide range of civil and criminal violations under its jurisdiction. ICE's FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending to be $5,442 million, $420 million less than FY2012. Resource allocation for ICE's diverse activities is a debated issue, including its role in detaining and removing aliens. Enforcement and Removal Operations are part of ICE's mission. The FY2013 appropriations process for ICE involves discussions on detaining and removing aliens, including those who have committed crimes. ICE has the capacity to remove unauthorized aliens in the United States. ICE is tasked with locating and removing deportable aliens, including those who have committed crimes. There are approximately 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the US. ICE can remove 400,000 aliens annually, leading to debates on prioritizing removal. Amendments in H.R. 5855 aimed to direct ICE's enforcement priorities. P.L. 113-6 allocates $1,600 for these efforts. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens annually, sparking debates on prioritizing removal. H.R. 5855 and P.L. 113-6 aim to direct ICE's enforcement priorities by allocating funds to identify and remove criminal aliens based on the severity of their crimes. The act P.L. 113-6 allocates $1,600 million to identify and remove criminal aliens based on the severity of their crimes. ICE's ERO manages custody and ensures the departure of aliens ordered removed, but some argue there is insufficient detention space. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Concerns exist about insufficient detention space leading to decisions on release based on space availability rather than individual cases, resulting in varying detention conditions and inequities. Some policymakers suggest using alternatives to detention. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees due to concerns about inequities in detention conditions and decisions based on space availability. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a proposed reduction in the President's FY2013 budget. ICE has faced challenges with the number of detention beds, with a proposed reduction to 32,800 beds in FY2013. In response, 2,228 detainees were released in early 2013 due to budget constraints and sequestration requirements. ICE Director John Morton highlighted the necessity of these releases during a hearing. ICE's FY2013 budget requested a reduction in bed space to 32,800 beds. In early 2013, 2,228 detainees were released due to budget constraints and sequestration requirements. ICE Director John Morton explained the necessity of the releases during a hearing, while critics viewed it as a political move to pressure Congress. ICE's FY2013 budget requested a reduction in bed space to 32,800 beds. In early 2013, 2,228 detainees were released due to budget constraints and sequestration requirements. John Morton stated that although the CR had funded 34,000 beds, ICE's average daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including many who were not required to be detained under law. Critics responded that the release was purely political to pressure Congress. P.L. 113-6 requires ICE to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013, leading to interest in developing alternatives to detention for certain types of aliens. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring options, like electronic devices and home visits, for aliens awaiting hearings or appeals. This is in response to the cost of detaining aliens and the interest in alternatives due to non-detained aliens with final removal orders not leaving the country. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program provides less restrictive monitoring options for aliens awaiting hearings or appeals, using tools like electronic devices and home visits. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases funding for the ATD program by $19 million. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases funding for the ATD program by $24 million. ICE is requesting resources to expand Secure Communities nationwide by the end of FY2013. ICE is expanding Secure Communities program to check fingerprints of arrestees against immigration records. They aim to confirm the identification of more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators support the expansion and have allocated resources accordingly. ICE is expanding the Secure Communities program to confirm the identification of more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators strongly support the program's expansion and have allocated resources accordingly for FY2013. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents through agreements like the \u00a7287(g) program and Secure Communities has sparked debate about their proper role. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents through agreements like the \u00a7287(g) program and Secure Communities has sparked debate about their proper role, with concerns over training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some argue that the federal government lacks resources to enforce immigration law effectively. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. They argue that the Secure Communities screening process is more efficient and cost-effective in identifying and removing criminal and other priority individuals. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level.

TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the United States. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to protect transportation systems in the US against terrorist threats. TSA's responsibilities include deploying screeners, detection systems, and security technologies for aviation, marine, and land transportation. The TSA is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US against terrorist threats by deploying screeners, detection systems, and security technologies for aviation, marine, and land transportation. They also assess the risk of terrorist attacks for non-aviation transportation assets, issue regulations to improve security, and enforce these regulations. The TSA budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill. The TSA is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US by deploying security measures, issuing regulations, and enforcing them. The TSA budget is a complex component of the DHS Appropriations bill, with various resources available including airline security fees and capital investments in screening technology. The TSA's budget is part of the DHS Appropriations bill and includes various resources like airline security fees and capital investments in screening technology. Non-appropriated sources also contribute to the TSA's total budgetary resources. The TSA's budget includes fees for transportation threat assessment and credentialing, not reflected in traditional appropriations. The President's request for TSA's budget included $7,645 million in gross budget authority, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, a 2.5% decrease from FY2012. The President's request for TSA's budget included $7,645 million in gross budget authority, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represents a 2.5% decrease from FY2012, with $5,099 million allocated for aviation security, a 3.0% decrease compared to the previous year. However, due to proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, only $2,914 million in net appropriations would have been provided, a 9.6% drop from FY2012 levels. The President's request for TSA's budget included $7,645 million in gross budget authority, with $5,099 million allocated for aviation security, a 3.0% decrease from FY2012. Proposed increases in passenger security fees would result in a net appropriation of $2,914 million, a 9.6% drop from the previous year. Additionally, $124 million was proposed for Surface Transportation Security, reflecting decreases in funding for procurement and maintenance costs. The President's request proposed a $10 million decrease (7.8%) for Surface Transportation Security from FY2012 levels. This decrease reflected planned reductions in procurement for baggage and checkpoint technologies, maintenance costs, the FFDO program, and flight crew training. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase by $68 million (33%) to $272 million, including a one-time increase of $30 million. The requested funding level for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%) from FY2012 levels.

The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million, a decrease from the Administration's request. The Senate accepted the Administration's proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. The Senate accepted the Administration's proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, leading to a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. This included cuts to checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing due to delayed fielding. The reductions were attributed to large unobligated prior-year balances. The Appropriations Committee report cited large unobligated prior-year balances as the reason for reductions in checkpoint equipment and explosives detection systems procurement. There was also a reduction in screener staffing due to delayed fielding of body scanners. The FFDO program received $24 million, $12 million above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. TSA was provided with $7,551 million in total gross budget under P.L. 113-6.

The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for TSA in FY2013 to be $7,212 million, $629 million less than FY2012. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, not to exceed $5.00 per one-way trip, with concerns raised about accuracy in reflecting passenger usage. The Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure under ATSA to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission, doubling the fee on direct flights. Airlines have raised concerns about the potential impact on passenger air travel. The Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission, doubling the fee on direct flights. Airlines have raised concerns about the potential impact on passenger air travel. The Administration proposed doubling the passenger security fee on direct flights to $5.00 per one-way trip in the FY2013 budget submission. This change is estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported this proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip in FY2013, with all fees going towards aviation security. The proposal also aimed to allocate $200 million towards deficit reduction. The Senate committee approved increasing passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip for FY2013, with all fees allocated to aviation security. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional limitations and the need to find offsets for the budget request's assumptions. The Senate committee approved increasing passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip for FY2013, but the House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal due to jurisdictional limitations. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees, and TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies compared to FY2012. TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies compared to FY2012, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. This raised oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. The identified savings raised oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner and highlighted the need for procedures to meet FY2013 efficiency goals. TSA has initiated risk-based screening initiatives to focus resources based on security risk assessments. TSA has implemented risk-based screening initiatives to focus resources on security risks, including a trusted traveler trial program called PreCheck, modified screening procedures for children and known flight crew members, and trial programs for elderly passengers. TSA has implemented risk-based screening initiatives, including a new trusted traveler trial program called PreCheck, modified screening procedures for children and known flight crew members, and trial programs for elderly passengers. These initiatives aim to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings, with PreCheck being a cornerstone program modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. The TSA's risk-based initiatives include the PreCheck program, modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. PreCheck is available on a trial basis to members of these programs, frequent flyer program members of three major airlines, and military service members at limited airports, with plans for further expansion in FY2013. The PreCheck program, including Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS, is available on a trial basis to certain members and frequent flyer program members at limited airports. TSA plans to expand the program in FY2013, with support from both House and Senate committees for its risk-based approach to screening. The Senate committee supports TSA's rational risk-based approach with the PreCheck program, aiming to increase screening efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. They directed TSA to report on expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. Specific concern was raised about the limitations of TSA's known crew member pilot program. The Senate committee supports TSA's risk-based PreCheck program, focusing on expanding the eligible population, passenger satisfaction, public awareness, time savings, and security measures. Concern was raised about the limited known crew member pilot program and the need to include flight attendants. TSA's behavioral-based screening of passengers faces scrutiny and criticism. The crew member pilot program is limited to pilots, but there is a push to include flight attendants. TSA's risk-based screening pilot programs are viewed positively, but their behavioral-based observation and screening of passengers face scrutiny. The House committee report questioned the increase in Behavior Detection Officers, citing a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. A formal cost-benefit analysis of the BDO program and a robust risk-based strategy are called for. The House committee report criticized TSA's proposal to increase Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) without clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. They called for a cost-benefit analysis of the BDO program and a robust risk-based strategy for deployment. TSA is required to provide semiannual briefings on progress in trusted traveler approaches and budgetary constraints. The budget justification specified a $13 million reduction in funds for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and crew member self-defense training program, but neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee have adopted this proposal. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the FFDO program at the FY2012 level. The House passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in Screener Payroll, Compensation, and Benefits, and Screening Technology Maintenance. The House passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in Screener Payroll, Compensation, and Benefits, and Screening Technology Maintenance. Report language directs TSA to utilize FFDOs and other law enforcement assets on commercial flights to complement air marshals. The Senate Appropriations Committee also disagreed with reducing FFDO funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees disagreed with reducing FFDO funding, recommending $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs to complement air marshals on commercial flights. This slight decrease from FY2012 reflects budget constraints, with funding fully restored at $25 million under P.L. 113-6 but subject to sequestration cuts. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for securing U.S. ports, coastal waters, and inland waterways. It recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs, slightly lower than FY2012 due to budget constraints. Funding was initially at $25 million but was reduced to $23 million in FY2013 due to sequestration cuts.

Following the sequester, the Service plans to expend $1.527 billion, $84 million less than what was appropriated. The reduction primarily impacted the Service's protection and investigation mission funding. The Secret Service's funding levels for FY2013 were detailed in 14 outlines, with a reduction in funding after sequestration. Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for the USSS, but following the sequester, the Service plans to expend $1.527 billion. One ongoing issue for Congress is balancing the investigative and protective missions of the Service. The Secret Service's funding was reduced after sequestration, leading to a balancing act for Congress between the Service's investigative and protective missions. Congressional focus has been on the protection mission and recent agent misconduct, while maintaining the Service's role in investigating financial crimes. The Secret Service's funding was reduced after sequestration, leading to a balancing act for Congress between the Service's investigative and protective missions. Congressional focus has been on the protection mission and recent agent misconduct, while maintaining the Service's role in investigating financial crimes. The majority of congressional action concerning USSS has been related to its protection mission and recent USSS agent misconduct. Potential terrorist attacks and threats to the President have increased the need for the Service's protection activities. Advocates for expansion of the investigation mission may argue that protection is enhanced through better threat investigation efforts.

The Administration proposed relocating US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other Department locations, while the House suggested retaining some functions in a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The Administration has proposed moving the activities of the US-VISIT program from NPPD to other locations within the Department. The House has proposed keeping some functions within the Directorate in a newly established Office of Biometric Identify Management. The activities of the Office of the Under Secretary are supported by the Management and Administration Program, while the activities of the Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications are supported by the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS). The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013, $29 million less than FY2012. The Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, roughly even with FY2012. The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013, $29 million less than FY2012. The FY2013 Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, roughly even with FY2012. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, an increase of $278 million above the FY2012 appropriation. The FY2013 IPIS budget request was $1,167 million, a 31.3% increase from FY2012. The increase was mainly for securing federal information systems, with a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security to aid agencies in FISMA compliance. The FY2013 IPIS budget request saw a significant increase, with a focus on securing federal information systems. This included a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security to help agencies comply with FISMA requirements, and a $116 million increase for the Network Security Deployment project to support the deployment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS). The $116 million increase is for expanding the Network Security Deployment project, which supports the deployment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS). The NCPS is an intrusion detection system using digital signatures from the NSA. The funding will expand deployment of version 3.0 for active defenses and version 2.2 for threat visualization and information sharing across federal agencies. The additional funding of $116 million is for expanding the Network Security Deployment project, supporting the deployment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) with digital signatures from the NSA. It will enhance version 3.0 for active defenses and version 2.2 for threat visualization and information sharing across federal agencies. Other increases include $15 million for US-CERT to analyze data from NCPS and $5 million for MS-ISAC to support cybersecurity efforts of state and local governments. The FY2013 budget included increases in funding for US-CERT and MS-ISAC to support cybersecurity efforts, while infrastructure protection and communications funding saw reductions compared to FY2012 levels. The FY2013 budget decreased funding for infrastructure protection and communications within the IPIS budget. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million (13.7%) below the FY2012 appropriation, with a significant portion attributed to the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. This project supports compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at covered facilities. The budget for Infrastructure Security Compliance project was reduced by $19 million (20.1%), with $16 million attributed to NPPD's ability to use funds. $8 million in reductions was linked to the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises, which would continue under other projects. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with $5 million less for Management and Administration citing the Administration's use of funds. $8 million in reductions was linked to the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with $5 million less for Management and Administration due to unauthorized TSA fee increases and poor compliance with statutory requirements.

NPPD identified issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program. The Department of Homeland Security's funding levels for FY2012 and FY2013 were summarized by OMB, with potential transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. NPPD identified issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program, which Congress is likely to oversee. Congress has also focused on cybersecurity during the 112th Congress. The Directorate is reviewing the CFATS compliance program to mitigate identified problems. Congress has a continued interest in ensuring compliance with CFATS and oversight of the issue. Cybersecurity has been a focus for Congress during the 112th Congress, with attention on various bills addressing information sharing, education, workforce development, roles and responsibilities in protecting federal information systems, and safeguarding critical infrastructure assets. During the 112th Congress, cybersecurity was a focus with bills addressing information sharing, education, workforce development, and protecting federal information systems and critical infrastructure assets. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources, particularly for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) within the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) responsible for security of federal property and personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is tasked with safeguarding federal property, personnel, and buildings through security and law enforcement measures to mitigate criminal and terrorist threats. FPS conducts risk assessments, deploys countermeasures like barriers and cameras, provides law enforcement response, supports Facility Security Committees, and offers emergency and safety education programs. Additionally, FPS aids other federal agencies such as the U.S. Secret Service. FPS protection and security operations involve risk assessments, countermeasures like barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, support for Facility Security Committees, and emergency education programs. FPS also assists federal agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service, and is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. FPS currently employs around 1,225 personnel. FPS assists federal agencies like the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events and is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel, along with 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS, which was a $40 million increase from FY2012.

The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no specific changes to the FPS budget for FY2013, but required a briefing on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. No specific changes to the FPS budget were recommended in P.L. 113-6 or the accompanying explanatory statement. FPS was directed to brief the appropriations committees on their progress in implementing recommendations from a GAO report. The FPS budget for FY2013 saw no specific changes recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Despite being unaffected by sequestration due to its fee-based structure, Congress remains concerned about aspects of the FPS mission and funding. Appropriators are interested in enhancing training for contract guards and potentially federalizing them. Due to its fee-based structure, the FPS budget was not impacted by sequestration. Congress is concerned about aspects of the FPS mission and funding, with an interest in improving training for contract guards, federalizing them, setting standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee. Legislation such as H.R. 176, H.R. 2658, and S. 772 was introduced in the 112th Congress to address these issues. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to improve federal building security and strengthen the Federal Protective Service's ability to protect buildings and personnel. However, none of the proposed bills were enacted before the end of the Congress. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, aims to address these issues. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, aims to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expand the use of federal employees in place of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like the BioWatch program and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center. The Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 aims to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expand the use of federal employees in place of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like the BioWatch program, the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), and the department's occupational health and safety programs, as well as coordinating or consulting on DHS programs with a public health or medical component. OHA received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations, with a requested $166 million for the following year. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like the BioWatch program, the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), and DHS occupational health and safety programs. OHA received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations, with a requested $166 million for FY2013 to support 101 FTEs. The proposed allocation includes funding for BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, and Planning and Coordination. The requested funding for OHA for FY2013 is $166 million, $1 million less than FY2012. It would support 101 FTEs, 2 more than in FY2012. The proposed allocation includes $125 million for BioWatch, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, $35 million less than FY2012. The House-passed bill for FY2013 would have provided $132 million, $35 million less than FY2012. The Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million, $1 million more than FY2012. The decrease in funding largely reflected a decrease for the BioWatch program. The Senate committee recommended $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than FY2012 and the President's request. The funding includes amounts for BioWatch, Planning and Coordination, Salaries and Expenses, and $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. After cuts, P.L. 113-6 provides $132 million for OHA, a decrease from FY2012. The Senate committee recommended $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than FY2012 and the President's request, including funding for BioWatch, Planning and Coordination, Salaries and Expenses, and $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. P.L. 113-6 provides $132 million for OHA, a decrease from FY2012, with reductions largely due to decreased funding for BioWatch. The OHA budget for FY2013 was $34 million less than the President's request and faced no further reduction due to sequestration. Reductions in funding largely reflect decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2013 under P.L. 113-6 reflect across-the-board cuts. Table 17 shows enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2012 and FY2013, including the Administration's request, House-passed and Senate-reported amounts, and enacted amounts under P.L. 113-6 with across-the-board cuts. The \"DHS Plan\" column reflects post-sequester resources as of April 26, 2013, but final funding levels may change due to transfers and reprogramming by the department. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted the separation of DHS activities to monitor threats in its report on FY2013 funding recommendations. The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of DHS activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), specifically mentioning the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) for radiological and nuclear threats, and OHA for chemical and biological threats. The Committee directed the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to merge the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate report and House explanatory statement did not carry a parallel directive, but the Senate reiterated the need for coordination of WMD activities. The House Appropriations Committee directed the merger of DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate reiterated the need for coordination of WMD activities and called for a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including potential performance improvements and cost savings from the merger. The review is due to Congress by September 1, 2013. The BioWatch program deploys sensors in over 30 large U.S. cities to detect potential threats. The House Appropriations Committee directed the merger of DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014.

After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions, plus $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. These numbers do not represent the full range of appropriated resources available to FEMA, as the DRF received a significant infusion of capital from P.L. 113-2. State and local governments have primary responsibility for most domestic public safety functions. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to fiscal constraints, impacting national preparedness levels. No authoritative statement has been released on post-sequester funding levels from P.L. 113-2. Local governments facing budget constraints may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness, impacting national readiness levels. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal in coordination with various government levels. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal in coordination with various government levels, focusing on specific threats and vulnerabilities to define core capabilities necessary for incident preparedness. The national preparedness goal for local, tribal, and territorial governments focuses on specific threats and vulnerabilities, with concrete objectives to mitigate risks. It defines core capabilities needed to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to national security, superseding a previous directive issued after 9/11. The National Preparedness Goal supersedes a previous directive issued after 9/11 and focuses on preparing for specific incidents that pose the greatest risk to national security. It identifies core capabilities and targets for response to domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. The National Preparedness Goal, released in 2011, aims to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies by setting a national all-hazards preparedness goal. It defines success as a secure and resilient nation with the capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) defined success as a secure and resilient Nation with capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. Prior to 9/11, there were only three federal grant programs available for homeland security. Before 9/11, only three federal grant programs were available for homeland security. Additional programs were later added to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Citizen Corps Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and Driver's License Security. Several additional homeland security grant programs were added after 9/11 to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Citizen Corps Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and various other grant programs such as Port Security Grants and Public Transportation Security Assistance. Several homeland security grant programs were established after 9/11 to enhance state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Federal assistance for preparedness activities only makes up a small portion of state and local public safety spending. Federal grant programs such as BZPP, IECGP, and EOC provide assistance to state and local governments for preparedness activities, but this funding is a small fraction of the total $218 billion spent annually by state and local governments on public safety, including police, fire, correction, and protective services. The total expenditures for public safety by state and local governments amount to $218 billion annually. This includes costs for police protection, fire protection, correction, and protective inspections. Federal grant programs for state and local preparedness make up less than one percent of these expenditures. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for homeland security preparedness in FY2013, an increase of $400 million from the previous year. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, an increase of $400 million from the previous year. This funding would support the establishment of a National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) to consolidate various state and local preparedness grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to establish a National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) for FY2013 due to lack of congressional authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to establish a National Preparedness Grant Program for FY2013 due to lack of congressional authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns about consolidating state and local preparedness grants, citing uncertainties in risk assessments and funding allocation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs. The Senate Committee expressed concern over the proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants, citing uncertainties in risk assessments and funding allocation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and advocating for the grant structure enacted in FY2012 to continue in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the consolidation proposal for State and Local Programs, recommending grant funding distribution at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various grant programs. The funding allocated was approximately $300 million more than FY2012 and $100 million less than the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the consolidation proposal for State and Local Programs, recommending grant funding distribution at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various grant programs. Of the $1.7 billion allocated, $55 million was provided to Operation Stonegarden and $150 million for other security initiatives.

P.L. 113-6 provided $1,467 million for state and local programs, a 20.3% decrease from the requested level. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program by $77 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan increased funding for state and local grants program by $77 million. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer from grant programs for FEMA's administrative costs, resulting in $132 million higher total funding than FY2012. Table 18 outlines funding levels for FEMA state and local programs. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan increased state and local grants program funding by $77 million. The removal of administrative costs transfer in P.L. 113-6 resulted in $132 million higher total funding than FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance grants. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance grants, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER. DHS historically set aside up to 5% of AFG funding for program management. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance grants, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER. The proposal includes categorizing firefighter assistance grants under First Responder Assistance Programs (FRAP) within FEMA's State and Local Programs (SLP) appropriation. Grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office starting in FY2013. Legislative language is requested to allow SAFER grants to be used for maintaining firefighter staffing levels. In FY2013, grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office. The Administration requested legislative language to allow SAFER grants to maintain firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The House-passed bill for FY2013 would fund firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The Senate-reported bill also proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with specific allocations for AFG and SAFER. The House-passed bill allocated up to 4.7% of firefighter assistance for program administration, while the Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with specific allocations for AFG and SAFER. The Senate Committee denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account and included SAFER waiver authority language. The Senate Committee denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS retains SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The DRF funds various emergency and disaster assistance programs annually through regular appropriations. The DRF is the main account used to fund emergency and disaster assistance programs annually through regular appropriations. However, the account often runs out of funds before the end of the fiscal year due to ongoing recovery efforts from major events like the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. This reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding. In recent years, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has often depleted before the fiscal year ends due to ongoing recovery efforts from major disasters like the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. The reliance on supplemental funding has been linked to underfunding, with average monthly expenditures exceeding regular appropriations between 2005 and 2011. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF in FY2013. The underfunding of the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has led to depletion before the fiscal year ends. Between 2005 and 2011, average monthly expenditures exceeded regular appropriations. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2013, a decrease of $1,011 million (14.2%) from the previous year. The request included $608 million for activities not directly tied to major disasters and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, with $608 million for non-major disaster activities and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs under the Stafford Act. This reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing disaster costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The request was over three times larger than the previous year's. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, with $608 million for non-major disaster activities and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs under the Stafford Act. This reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing disaster costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The Administration requested funding for the DRF based on past declared catastrophic events, plus a reserve to prevent shortfalls. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate-reported bills carried this adjustment. The requested funding for the DRF was based on past declared catastrophic events, the 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, and a $500 million reserve. The House-passed bill and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's FY2013 funding request for the DRF. Additionally, both bills included an unrequested transfer of $24 million from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. The House-passed bill and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's FY2013 funding request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Both bills included a $24 million transfer from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. P.L. 113-6 funds the DRF at $7,007 million, with $24 million allocated for audits on public assistance projects exceeding $10 million and FEMA's debris removal decisions for Hurricane Gustav in 2008. P.L. 113-6 funds the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) at $7,007 million, with $24 million allocated for audits on public assistance projects exceeding $10 million and FEMA's debris removal decisions for Hurricane Gustav in 2008. The operating plan for DHS for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced the funding by 5% to $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for an \"allowable adjustment\" to provide additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, beyond regular discretionary budget allocation. This adjustment was used to increase the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) by $918 million, totaling $7,007 million in funding. Sequestration reduced the DRF to $6,653 million for FY2013. The Office of Management and Budget annually calculates an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to the BCA's discretionary spending caps. This adjustment provides additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, beyond the regular discretionary budget allocation. Without this adjustment, federal spending over the allocation could trigger a sequestration. It's important to note that \"disaster relief\" funding under the BCA and the Disaster Relief Fund are not the same. The BCA defines funding for \"disaster relief\" as funding for activities carried out pursuant to a major disaster. The Disaster Relief Fund receives an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief under the BCA's discretionary spending caps. This funding is separate from the regular discretionary budget allocation and is used for activities related to major disaster declarations. Funding for the DRF comes from various federal accounts, not just FEMA. While some DRF funding is eligible for adjustment under the BCA, it is not solely designated for disaster relief as defined by the BCA. The Disaster Relief Fund, funded through various federal accounts, receives an allowable adjustment for disaster relief under the BCA. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the DRF had access to $7.3 billion from a continuing resolution, including supplemental disaster assistance. In October 2012, the Disaster Relief Fund had access to $7.3 billion from a continuing resolution and additional resources were approved through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Congress approved $11,485 million in additional resources for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2013 through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The total amount exceeded the allowable adjustment for disaster relief before considering additional disaster assistance requested by the Administration. In FY2013, Congress provided emergency funding to cover disaster relief exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Stafford Act. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program and did not request additional funds. In FY2013, Congress allocated funding to cover disaster relief exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Stafford Act. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program, suggesting it duplicated the work of the HMGP program funded by the National Flood Insurance Program. The PDM program was proposed to be eliminated as it was seen to duplicate the work of the HMGP program funded by the National Flood Insurance Program. PDM awards were made prior to disaster events, unlike HMGP, and addressed all types of hazards, not just flood hazards. There was over $174 million in unobligated balances available for the PDM program to continue awarding. The PDM program, unlike HMGP, makes awards before disasters and covers all hazards, not just floods. Despite proposals to end the program, there is over $174 million available for grants. Concerns were raised about the slow pace of awards, with the House bill proposing $14.3 million and the Senate bill proposing $35 million in appropriations. The PDM program may continue awarding grants for several years despite proposals to end it. The House and Senate bills signal concerns about slow award pace and unobligated balances. Funding levels proposed are $14.3 million and $35 million, respectively, with rescinded funding from unobligated balances. The PDM program faces challenges due to reduced funding levels, with the post-sequester amount for FY2013 set at just under $25 million. This funding level makes it difficult to fund state minimum awards and conduct a new round of applications. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 sets the post-sequester amount for PDM at just under $25 million, presenting challenges to the program administration. Reduced funding levels make it difficult to fund state minimum awards and conduct a new round of applications. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program, requesting $100 million for FY2013, a reduction of $20 million. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program, requesting $100 million for FY2013, a reduction of $20 million from the appropriated level in FY2012. Congress funded the program at $120 million in FY2012, $20 million over the requested level. The House has placed the funding level at $120 million for FY2013, while the Senate has suggested raising it to $150 million. The EFS program funding for FY2013 is a point of contention between the House and Senate, with the House proposing $120 million and the Senate suggesting $150 million. The post-sequester funding level is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also exist over delayed fund distribution in FY2012. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 shows EFS program funding at $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns arise over delayed fund distribution in FY2012, with FEMA and the National Board taking nine months to begin distributing assistance. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 allocated $114 million for the EFS program, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns were raised over the delayed distribution of funds during FY2012, with FEMA and the National Board taking nine months to begin distributing assistance, which was nearly double the time directed by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 included funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, with a requested amount of $1,561 million, a decrease of $229 million from the enacted level. The House-passed bill provided $1,510 million, a decrease of 3.3% from the requested level and 13.4% above FY2012.

The Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million, 1.7% below the request and 15.2% above FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million after across-the-board cuts, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 2.2% above FY2012. The Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million for USCIS, 1.7% below the request and 15.2% above FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 2.2% above FY2012. Table 19 lists the enacted amounts for FY2012, the Administration's request for FY2013, and the appropriations from P.L. 113-6. USCIS's major activities are highlighted. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is primarily involved in adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The Senate-reported bill allocates $1,535 million for USCIS, slightly below the request but higher than FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million for USCIS, a decrease from the requested level but still above FY2012. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is responsible for adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The Senate-reported bill allocates $1,535 million for USCIS, slightly below the request but higher than FY2012. This funding covers adjudication of various petitions, naturalization processes, and humanitarian concerns. The USCIS is responsible for adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The agency funds its operations through direct appropriations and fee income from the Examinations Fee Account. USCIS funds its operations through revenues generated by the Examinations Fee Account, which includes processing immigrant, nonimmigrant, refugee, asylum, and citizenship benefits. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. In FY2013, USCIS had a gross budget authority of $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The direct appropriation included funding for the E-Verify program, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and Systematic Alien. The USCIS gross budget authority for FY2013 was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The direct appropriation included funding for the E-Verify program, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and Systematic Alien Verification Entitlements (SAVE) Program. The FY2013 USCIS budget included $20 million for the SAVE Program to verify individuals' eligibility for benefits based on immigration status. The remaining $2,862 million was to be funded by fee collections, with $2,391 million for adjudication services, $89 million for customer services, and $382 million for administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total budget authority of $3,004 million for USCIS in FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a USCIS budget of $3,004 million for FY2013, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. This amount was $31 million less than requested but $9.5 million above FY2012. No funds were included for the requested pay increase. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a USCIS budget of $3,004 million for FY2013, with $2,892 million from fee collections. The proposed appropriations were $31 million less than requested but $9.5 million above FY2012. The Committee directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify, which was funded as requested. Monitoring of fee revenues and obligations was emphasized, with $20 million allocated for the SAVE program. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. It did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting that the Department of Defense should fund it. The Committee directed USCIS to allocate $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records and not fund military naturalizations, suggesting the Department of Defense should cover the costs. The House Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions and OIG to assess USCIS actions. The House Committee directed USCIS to address concerns about adjudication procedures and fraud detection by providing a progress report on corrective actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a budget for USCIS in FY2013 at $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a budget of $2,999 million for USCIS in FY2013, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. They recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program and allocated $20 million of user fee revenues for it. Additionally, $112 million was recommended for the E-Verify program, and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations and directed an additional $5 million be made available for these grants via fees. No appropriations were to be used for the Office of Citizenship Services, with operations to be fee-funded. The Committee expressed concern about potential costs exceeding 11% for administering the Immigrant Integration grant program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants and directed an additional $5 million via fees. No appropriations were to be used for the Office of Citizenship Services, with operations to be fee-funded. The Committee limited administrative costs to 5% of the grant funding level in FY2013. The grant program's funding level for FY2013 was set at $114 million, a decrease from the requested amount but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would further reduce the funding to $109 million. Administrative costs were limited to 5% of the grant funding level. The Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $114 million for the grant program, a decrease from the requested amount but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would further reduce the funding to $109 million. Administrative costs were limited to 5% of the grant funding level. The enacted amounts for USCIS for FY2012, the Administration's request for FY2013, and the impact of sequestration on funding levels are outlined in Table 20. Potential issues for Congress in the FY2013 budget cycle included concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, and the USCIS Transformation program. For FY2013 budget cycle, potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing administration. USCIS must monitor fee revenues accurately to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. The House Committee directed USCIS to include the costs of operations, such as asylum and refugee processing, in assessing the need for future fee adjustments and to provide quarterly briefings on fee revenues and obligations. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains a congressional issue, with the Administration requesting $11 million. The House Committee directed USCIS to include the costs of operations, such as asylum and refugee processing, in assessing the need for future fee adjustments and to provide quarterly briefings on fee revenues and obligations. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains a congressional issue, with the Administration requesting $11 million in appropriations for FY2013. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 requires USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds in FY2013 for its immigrant integration grants program. The Administration requested $11 million in appropriations for FY2013, with $7.5 million allocated from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds for immigrant integration grants. An additional $2.5 million in appropriations was also allocated for the grants, with a requirement that funds not be used for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The House Committee expressed disappointment with USCIS Transformation progress. The bill allocates $2.5 million for grants, with a requirement that funds not be used for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program. The Committee expressed concern over the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract. They directed USCIS to provide updates on efforts to deliver the first application form release and raised concerns about the operability of the E-Verify program. In 2012, USCIS had little progress in delivering capabilities to customers. Congress directed USCIS to provide updates on the first application form release and the E-Verify program. The House bill extended E-Verify authorization for one year and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify. The House bill extended E-Verify authorization for one year and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its use in the agricultural industry. Challenges in agriculture include non-office-based hiring, limited internet access, seasonal employment, and high turnover. The House Committee supported efforts to increase efficiency and reduce expenses in using E-Verify in the agricultural industry. They also aimed to ensure immediate access to information and reduce the need for paper files, addressing challenges such as non-office-based hiring and limited internet access. The Committee directed USCIS to address issues like shipping errors and delays in processing documentation. The House Committee supported efforts to increase efficiency, reduce expenses, and ensure immediate access to information by converting immigration records to digital format. They directed USCIS to eliminate the paper version of USCIS Form I-94 and address issues like shipping errors and delays in processing documentation. The House Committee directed USCIS to continue converting immigration records to digital format through EDMS and eliminate the paper version of USCIS Form I-94. They also urged DHS to review refugee processing procedures to streamline processing while maintaining security measures. The Committee expressed concerns about coordinating security and non-security clearance procedures for processing vulnerable individuals for resettlement in the United States. They urged DHS to review refugee processing to streamline procedures while maintaining security vetting. The Senate Committee also encouraged DHS to use its parole authority to address urgent humanitarian needs, such as family unity and medical emergencies. The Senate Committee urged DHS to use its parole authority under Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to address urgent humanitarian needs, particularly for family unity and medical emergencies following natural disasters like the Haitian earthquake in January 2010. They also recommended allocating sufficient resources for similar responsiveness to future deadly disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides law enforcement training. The Senate Committee urged DHS to allocate resources for medical emergencies after natural disasters like the Haitian earthquake in January 2010. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training to federal, state, and local law enforcement entities, as well as international agencies. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) offers basic and advanced law enforcement training to various federal, state, and local entities, as well as international agencies. FLETC aims to promote consistency and collaboration among its partner organizations by training officers in a multi-agency environment. The Center has four training sites across the United States, employs around 1,100 personnel, and also provides online and off-site training when necessary. FLETC administers training sites across the US, employs 1,100 personnel, and offers online/off-site training. The proposed budget is $258 million, a $13 million reduction from FY2012. The Administration proposed a budget of $258 million for FLETC, a reduction of $13 million from FY2012. The budget includes Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million, with reductions in both areas. The proposed budget for FLETC is $258 million, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses. The House-passed bill included $256 million for FLETC, with cuts in both areas. The House-passed bill included $256 million for FLETC, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriations. The Senate-reported S. 3216 would have maintained funding at $258 million as requested by the President. The House Appropriations Committee report cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases for budget funding as the reason for reductions to the acquisition budget. Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a $1 million decrease from the requested level. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided $257 million for FLETC, a decrease of $1 million from the requested level but $14 million below the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration would further reduce this to $245 million for the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T), the primary DHS organization for research and development. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce the funding for the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) from $271 million to $245 million. S&T is responsible for research and development within DHS, funding R&D in its own laboratories and other entities. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) within DHS conducts R&D in its own labs, funds R&D in other entities, and supports acquisitions for other DHS components. The Administration requested $831 million for S&T in FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) saw a $212 million increase (79.9%) above the FY2012 level. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The request for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) saw a $212 million increase (79.9%) above the FY2012 level, with the largest increase in funding for disaster resilience R&D. There was a $50 million reduction in the request for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The largest requested increase in FY2013 was for disaster resilience R&D, with a reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for NBAF. The $50 million appropriated in FY2012 for NBAF construction was one-third of the Administration's request. DHS planned an assessment to determine the need for a facility like NBAF considering current threats, cost, and safety. The FY2012 appropriation for NBAF construction was $50 million, one-third of the Administration's request. DHS planned an assessment to determine the need for NBAF considering current threats, cost, and safety. The House-passed bill allocated $826 million for the S&T Directorate, $6 million less than the request, with $72 million less for RDI. The House-passed bill allocated $826 million for the S&T Directorate, $6 million less than the request. It included $72 million less for RDI and directed DHS to determine how to allocate that reduction. The bill provided $75 million more for Laboratory Facilities, with the increase to be spent on NBAF construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels that matched the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels that matched the Administration's request for the S&T Directorate. However, they specified separate amounts for each of the six thrust areas within RDI. The committee did not provide funding for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion for the facility. After adjustments, P.L. 113-6 allocated $834 million for the S&T Directorate, which is $28 million less than the requested amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request for the S&T Directorate, with separate amounts for each thrust area. No funding was recommended for NBAF construction due to a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion. P.L. 113-6 allocated $834 million for the S&T Directorate, $28 million less than requested. The act provides $37 million more than the request for Laboratory Facilities, specifically for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. The act provides $37 million more than the request for Laboratory Facilities, specifically for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. The explanatory statement directs DHS to submit a breakout of how it allocates RDI funding by thrust area. Table 21 outlines the funding levels for existing S&T program functions. The DHS post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for combating nuclear threats within DHS. See Table 22 for DNDO funding breakdown from FY2012 to FY2013. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is the primary DHS organization for combating the threat of nuclear attack. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 13% above the FY2012 appropriation of $290 million. The request included an increase of $44 million (109.7%) for Transformational R&D. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, a 13% increase from FY2012. This included a $44 million increase for Transformational R&D. The proposal no longer suggested transferring the program to S&T. The increase for Transformational R&D was partially offset by a reduction of $23 million for Systems Development. In the Systems Acquisition account, there was a $20 million increase for human-portable radiation detectors and a decrease to $1 million for radiation portal monitors. The House-passed bill would have provided $316 million. The House-passed bill for FY2013 would have provided $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than the request. The reduction would mainly affect the Transformational R&D program. The bill also directed DHS to update its implementation plan for the global nuclear detection architecture. The House-passed bill for FY2013 allocated $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than requested. The reduction mainly impacted the Transformational R&D program. The bill also required DHS to update its implementation plan for the global nuclear detection architecture. The House Appropriations Committee suggested consolidating DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for potential cost savings and improved coordination. The House Appropriations Committee recommended merging DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs to create an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014, citing potential cost savings and improved coordination. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported DNDO funding levels consistent with the Administration's proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DHS to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014, with funding levels consistent with the Administration's proposal. They also requested an updated implementation plan for DHS's responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DHS to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014, with funding levels consistent with the Administration's proposal. The Senate-reported bill provided $318 million for DNDO, $9 million less than the request for Transformational R&D. The bill did not address the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. The Senate committee report did not address the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. P.L. 113-6 provides $318 million for DNDO, $9 million less than the request for Transformational R&D. The act directs DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the domestic portion of the global nuclear detection architecture. The explanatory statement directs DHS to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential consolidation. The act directs DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture.

The DHS is directed to review its WMD programs and consider consolidating DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined in Table 22 of the DHS appropriations bill. Transfers and reprogramming may occur to mitigate the impact of sequestration. The DHS assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to offset sequestration impacts. The DHS appropriations bill's Title V includes general provisions, such as rescissions of previous funding and occasional appropriations for special initiatives. This report focuses on new general provisions not covered elsewhere and those directly related. The bill contains general provisions that include rescissions of funding from previous years and appropriations for special initiatives. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill. The Administration requested rescissions in specific accounts rather than in the title, with no direct funding through general provisions for FY2013. They proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill, including one-time provisions and permanent changes in the U.S. Code. The FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill (Division D of P.L. 112-74) included rescissions and one-time provisions. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 15 restrictive provisions and adding five new general provisions. The Administration proposed removing 15 restrictive provisions from the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill and adding five new general provisions, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing FEMA to use earmarked Predisaster Hazard Mitigation grant funds. The curr_chunk introduces new provisions related to extending the termination deadline for E-Verify, allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds, establishing an outreach program for dam safety, allocating fees for customs inspectors, and enabling CBP to enter reimbursable fee agreements. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes $292 million in rescissions in Title V, reducing the net scoring of the bill. The provisions impact the bill's score, including allowing CBP to enter reimbursable fee agreements for services. The House concurred with dropping 22 general provisions but disagreed on 13 others. H.R. 5855 includes $292 million in rescissions in Title V, reducing the net scoring of the bill. The House concurred with dropping 22 general provisions but added 13 general provisions during floor action. The House Appropriations Committee added one of the five general provisions requested by the Administration, extending the termination deadline for E-Verify. Additionally, 13 general provisions were added to the bill during floor action, prohibiting certain uses of funds related to constitutional and legal protections against profiling and enforcement of a proposed ICE rule. The legislation allows for contravening constitutional and legal protections against profiling, enforcing a proposed ICE rule for undocumented aliens, funding a Public Advocate position within ICE, and enforcing a section of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The curr_chunk involves enforcing specific laws related to government contracting, funding CBP operations in Puerto Rico, and restricting government actions. The curr_chunk discusses restrictions on government officials related to immigration status information and the procurement of new light-duty vehicles in accordance with a Presidential Memorandum on alternative-fuel vehicles. The Puerto Rico Trust Fund; Government officials restricted from sharing immigration status information with Immigration and Naturalization Service; Prohibited from buying new light-duty vehicles without following Presidential Memorandum on alternative-fuel vehicles; Must comply with U.S. laws on immigration and deportation; Prohibited from purchasing, operating, or maintaining armed unmanned aerial vehicles. The curr_chunk discusses contraventions of U.S. laws related to immigration, deportation, and the use of armed unmanned aerial vehicles. It also mentions the enforcement of an executive order to provide language access services and the finalization of three policy memos. The curr_chunk outlines the Attorney General's authority to detain and release criminal aliens, enforce an executive order for language access services, implement ICE policy memos for immigration enforcement priorities, and terminate a local officials' immigration enforcement agreement. The Senate bill includes provisions to enforce ICE policy memos on immigration enforcement priorities and terminate local officials' immigration enforcement agreement. It also includes rescissions and provisions to offset costs. The Senate bill includes $192 million in rescissions in Title V and provisions to offset costs by $68 million.

The bill included provisions allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements. $307 million in rescissions were included in the bill to offset costs. The enacted bill included provisions allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements and included $307 million in rescissions to offset costs. Additionally, the bill dropped ten general provisions sought to be removed by the Administration and included funding for DHS initiatives like immigrant integration grants. The enacted bill dropped ten general provisions sought to be removed by the Administration and included funding for DHS initiatives such as immigrant integration grants, reimbursement of security costs, migration and consolidation of DHS data centers, and DHS headquarters consolidation. The Senate-reported bill funded immigrant integration grants, security cost reimbursements, DHS data center migration and consolidation, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation by agencies, and finally, payments for activities. The federal government spending process involves budget authority enactment by Congress, fund obligation by agencies, and payments for activities. Budget authority determines available funds for agencies to spend, with outlays reflecting actual payment amounts. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than budget authority allows. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, determining available funds for federal agencies. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be indefinite, one-year, multi-year, or no-year. One-year authority is only available for a specific fiscal year, while multi-year specifies a range of time for spending. Obligations are incurred when agencies employ personnel or enter contracts. During a specific fiscal year, unobligated funds are no longer available for spending. Multi-year budget authority allows funds to be obligated over a specified time period, while no-year budget authority can be obligated indefinitely. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions, and outlays represent actual spending during the fiscal year. Budget authority may not always align with outlays due to the multi-year nature of some funds. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments, or outlays, to be made from the Treasury. Outlays are the funds actually spent during a fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Discretionary agencies and programs, as well as appropriated entitlement programs, are funded each year through appropriations. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury.
