    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC to reduce greenhouse gases, but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase despite various proposed actions. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. In 2001, President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions, focusing instead on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which called for legally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration focused on voluntary initiatives to reduce emissions, with only six regulatory programs out of over 50 in the 2002 Climate Action Report. The Administration's 2002 Climate Action Report highlighted voluntary initiatives over regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Congressional proposals are being considered to further advance these efforts. Several congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved monitoring and market-oriented approaches. Several congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved monitoring and market-oriented approaches, such as enacting a trading program similar to the current acid rain reduction program. Additionally, there are proposals for energy and related programs that would also help reduce greenhouse gases. The report focuses on comparing two proposals for a market-oriented greenhouse gas reduction program, specifically during the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The report compares two proposals for a market-based greenhouse gas reduction program introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman during the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In February 2005, Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through market-based mechanisms. In May 2005, an expanded version of the Act was introduced to encourage innovation in carbon reduction technologies and mitigate climate change effects. The bill's provisions are similar to a previous amendment that failed in the 108th Congress. The bill S.342 aims to promote innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation. It includes emission reduction provisions similar to previous amendments that were not successful in the Senate. The bill would require economy-wide emission reductions through a flexible, market-based approach. The failed amendment S.1151 aimed for economy-wide emission reductions through a market-based strategy, allowing participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. It excluded residential and agricultural sources and entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. The draft amendment, based on the National Commission on Energy Policy report, proposes a mandatory, economy-wide tradeable permit program to reduce greenhouse gases. It excludes residential and agricultural sources and entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. The draft amendment, proposed by Senator Bingaman, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by mandating an accelerated reduction in the country's economy. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. The implementation would be through a flexible, market-oriented allowance system. The draft amendment mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the country's economy. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation would be through a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting safety valve. The draft amendment includes a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The initial price for payments is $7 a ton in 2010. Both proposals aim to control greenhouse gas emissions, covering the majority of U.S. emissions. The initial price for payments under the draft amendment is $7 a ton in 2010. The main difference between the two proposals is their approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions. S. 1151 would cap emissions from covered entities, while the draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, while S. 1151 would cap emissions from covered entities. If economic growth outpaces reductions in emissions intensity, emissions could continue to grow. A cost-limiting provision is also established. Under the draft amendment, economic growth will determine if total U.S. emissions grow or decline. A cost-limiting \"safety valve\" allows covered entities to purchase extra tradeable allowances or make a payment to DOE at a set price. Unlike S. 1151, there is no provision to limit the price per allowance that a covered entity would be required to pay. The draft amendment proposes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase extra tradeable allowances or make a payment to DOE at a set price. Unlike S. 1151, there is no provision to limit the price per allowance that a covered entity would be required to pay. The proposals also differ in terms of covered entities, agency responsibility, credit generation, and use of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. The draft amendment proposes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase extra tradeable allowances or make a payment to DOE at a set price, without a price limit per allowance. The proposals differ in covered entities, agency responsibility, credit generation, and use of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. Emission reduction estimates for both options have some uncertainty, especially for the draft amendment. The draft amendment and S.1151 proposals differ in key topics covered. Emission reduction estimates for both options have uncertainty, with S.1151 projected to achieve a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed S. 1151 and found it would achieve a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010, but not return emissions to 2000 or 1990 levels. CRS estimated a 2.5% reduction in emissions compared to EIA's scenario. No long-term reductions were estimated due to uncertainty. The draft amendment would result in a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. Long-term reductions were not estimated due to uncertainty, but emissions would likely continue to increase, albeit more slowly. Emissions not covered by the bill would increase over time, offsetting initial reductions achieved in 2010. The draft amendment would lead to a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. However, emissions not covered by the bill would increase over time, offsetting the initial reductions achieved in 2010. Under both options, emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to continue increasing, albeit at a slower pace than business-as-usual. In the case of S. 1151, the percentage of greenhouse gases not covered by the bill would increase and remain uncontrolled by the reduction program. Covered emissions would also continue to grow under the draft amendment, especially if economic growth outstripped the 2.4% annual reduction in carbon intensity. The draft amendment would lead to a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. However, covered emissions would continue to grow over time if economic growth outstripped the reduction in carbon intensity. Emissions could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment than under S. 1151. The draft amendment could potentially lead to a faster rise in emissions compared to S. 1151. The estimates may understate or overstate actual reductions due to differences in covered entities. The draft amendment, S.Amdt. 2028, is similar to S. 1151 but may have different numbers of covered entities, leading to uncertainties in estimated reductions. Estimates are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements. The draft amendment, S.Amdt. 2028, has uncertainties in estimated emission reductions compared to S. 1151 due to potential differences in covered entities. Estimates are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements, with uncertainties surrounding the draft amendment's estimate. The primary uncertainty for S. 1151 is the number of covered entities required to meet reduction requirements. The draft amendment, S.Amdt. 2028, has uncertainties in estimated emission reductions compared to S. 1151 due to potential differences in covered entities. Estimates do not consider carbon sequestration potential. The primary uncertainty for S. 1151 is the number of covered entities required to meet reduction requirements, with varying estimates of coverage leading to different levels of certainty and compliance costs. The draft amendment, S.Amdt. 2028, has uncertainties in estimated emission reductions compared to S. 1151. The coverage difference is significant, affecting compliance costs and certainty about quantity. The draft calculates a future baseline from uncertain variables, unlike S. 1151's historic baseline requirement. The draft amendment has uncertainties in estimated emission reductions compared to S. 1151, calculating a future baseline from uncertain variables like GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. Economic growth projections range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, affecting compliance costs and certainty. In EIA's projections, economic growth ranges from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case at 3.1%. CRS calculations assume 3.1% annual GDP growth, but this estimate could be off by 20% or more. Carbon intensity improvement projections are also uncertain. The estimate for carbon intensity improvement projection is uncertain, with a 2009 estimate of 165 MMTCE/M$GDP by CRS, compared to the targeted 159 MMTCE/M$GDP under the President's Climate Change Initiative. The current intensity levels are higher than projected, with a 2002 estimate of 183 MMTCE/M$GDP. The draft amendment, like S. 1151, raises questions about its coverage. The draft amendment raises questions about its coverage and the uncertainty of emissions reductions achieved under it, with a potential safety valve triggering a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide. The draft amendment's coverage is uncertain, with potential entities not covered. The safety valve could trigger a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide immediately or around 2015, adding uncertainty to emission reductions achieved. The safety valve could trigger a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide immediately or around 2015, adding uncertainty to emission reductions achieved. The projected cost under S. 1151 is more uncertain than under the draft amendment due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. The projected cost under S. 1151 is uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. Economic growth could lead to increased emissions that would need to be offset, potentially resulting in higher costs for emission reductions. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain due to potential increases in emissions from economic growth. More robust economic growth could lead to higher emissions that would need to be offset, resulting in higher costs for emission reductions. Studies on previous versions of S. 1151 estimated permit prices in 2010 at $9 or $15 per ton. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain due to potential increases in emissions from economic growth. Studies on previous versions estimated permit prices in 2010 at $9 or $15 per ton, affected by uncertainties related to energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, international credits, and future natural gas supply. A market-based allowance trading system aims to achieve a least-cost solution. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain, with studies showing permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010. The program aims for a least-cost solution through a market-based allowance trading system, but the draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to factors like energy efficiency improvements and natural gas supply. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to factors like energy efficiency improvements and natural gas supply compared to S. 1151. Unlike S. 1151, the draft amendment incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target, allowing for some increase in future emissions if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity. This results in fewer offsets required, leading to lower costs. The draft amendment requires less emission reductions than S. 1151 and incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target. This allows for some increase in future emissions if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity, resulting in lower costs. The draft amendment's cost estimates are influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures like energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. The draft amendment's projected costs are influenced by cost-effective control measures like energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. Unlike S. 1151, it does not include international credits in its flexible market implementation program, eliminating uncertainty and potentially lowering costs. The National Commission on Energy Policy set the permit price at $5 a ton in 2010. The draft amendment does not include international credits in its flexible market program, unlike S. 1151. The National Commission on Energy Policy set the permit price at $5 a ton in 2010, with a safety valve limiting upside risk to $7 a ton. Projected costs range from $4.8 to $5.9 per ton in 2001 dollars. The draft amendment sets a permit price at $5 a ton in 2010 with a safety valve limiting upside risk to $7 a ton. Projected costs range from $4.8 to $5.9 per ton in 2001 dollars, narrowing the band of potential costs substantially. The safety valve aims to bound the costs of any climate change control program. The draft amendment's safety valve limits upside cost to $7 a ton, narrowing cost uncertainty. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs to determine the economically efficient solution. A tradeable permit program sets allowable emissions under the program. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions focus on setting acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. For example, a tradeable permit program sets allowable emissions while letting the marketplace determine permit value. Similarly, a carbon tax sets a maximum cost per ton of CO2 for reducing emissions, with the marketplace determining the actual reduction amount. A tradeable permit program or carbon tax sets limits on emissions or costs, allowing the marketplace to determine value or reduction amounts based on uncertainty of costs and benefits. A preference for a pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of a safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs and benefits. For those confident in achieving a specific level of CO2 reduction with significant benefits, a tradeable permit program may be most appropriate. Emissions would be reduced to a specific level efficiently through trading permits, though not controlled at a specific cost level. If one is more concerned about the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy than the benefits of a specific level of reduction, including a safety valve in a tradeable permit program may be most appropriate. This approach allows for the efficient handling of costs involved in reducing CO2 emissions, concentrating efforts at sources where controls can be achieved at least cost. The trading of permits focuses on emission reduction efforts at sources where control can be achieved at least cost. Including a safety valve in the program caps the marginal cost of control, allowing emitters to spend money up to that level to reduce CO2 emissions. The precise level of CO2 reduction achieved is less certain due to the unknown marginal cost of control among millions of emitters. The safety valve in the emission reduction program caps the marginal cost of control for emitters, allowing them to spend money up to that level. The exact level of CO2 reduction achieved is uncertain due to unknown marginal costs among emitters. The safety valve could be viewed as a contingent carbon tax, raising questions about the economic costs and uncertainty of the program. The safety valve in the emission reduction program sets a cap on the marginal cost of control for emitters, allowing them to spend up to that level. The uncertainty in achieving CO2 reduction makes it similar to a contingent carbon tax, raising questions about economic costs and program uncertainty. The policy debate revolves around prioritizing economic costs with uncertainty (safety valve) or achieving specific emission reduction efficiently (tradeable permits). S. 1151 leans towards total emissions control, while the draft amendment leans towards price control. The draft amendment and S. 1151 propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with differing approaches. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions for covered entities, allowing trading under the cap, while the draft amendment focuses more on price control. The two proposals, S. 1151 and the draft amendment, aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions through market-based systems. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions for covered entities with trading allowed, while the draft amendment focuses on limiting emissions intensity and includes a cost-limiting safety valve. S. 1151 is expected to result in larger and more certain emissions reductions compared to the draft amendment, which leans more towards price control. The draft amendment would limit greenhouse gas emissions intensity and establish a cost-limiting safety valve. Short-term U.S. emissions would likely be below a business-as-usual scenario, with reductions expected to be larger and more certain under S. 1151. Total U.S. emissions are projected to continue increasing, but at a slower rate than currently forecasted under both proposals."
