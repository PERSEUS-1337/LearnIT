    "content": "The \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" prohibits the import of spent nuclear fuel. The \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" prohibits the import of spent nuclear fuel into the United States unless specific conditions are met. SEC. 3. NATIONAL SECURITY EXCEPTIONS. The prohibition on imports of spent nuclear fuel does not apply to countries not authorized to possess nuclear weapons under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, known or suspected to be developing nuclear weapons, and notified to the relevant congressional committees by the President. The President must notify congressional committees 30 days in advance of importing fuel into the US if the country is known or suspected to be producing nuclear weapons. The prohibition does not apply to samples imported for testing and evaluation for national security purposes. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES BY PORT AUTHORITIES FOR SAFE SHIPMENT OF MATERIAL. Port authorities can establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at ports to protect public health and the environment. These guidelines may include requirements for compliance during unloading, transfer, and shipment processes. Port authorities can establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at ports, ensuring compliance with safety measures and environmental protection. Guidelines may include worker training and a comprehensive response plan for emergencies. Workers must be properly trained in handling spent nuclear fuel, a comprehensive response plan must be in place before fuel enters the port, and local communities must be informed of fuel activities and potential consequences. Before spent nuclear fuel can enter the port, comprehensive response plans and proper training for workers are necessary. Local communities must also be informed of fuel activities and potential consequences, including reasonable standards for storage and transport. The port authority or local communities should establish standards for storage and transport of spent nuclear fuel to prevent radiation exposure and accidents during transportation. Prohibitions are in place to restrict the movement of spent nuclear fuel from the port under certain conditions to minimize radiation exposure and accident risks. Worker radiation exposure levels must not exceed public exposure standards. These guidelines are more protective of public health and safety compared to other applicable laws. The guidelines for public exposure standards are more protective than other laws governing the unloading, transfer, or shipment of spent nuclear fuel. The existence of other requirements does not prevent the adoption or enforcement of these guidelines. The Act does not impact the port's liability in handling nuclear materials. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines \"atomic energy defense activity\" as functions carried out by the Secretary of Energy, including naval reactors development, weapons activities, verification technology, nuclear materials production, waste management, and materials security. The Act defines \"atomic energy defense activity\" as functions carried out by the Secretary of Energy, including weapons activities, verification technology, nuclear materials production, waste management, materials security, and research and development. The term \"port authority\" refers to any authority with jurisdiction over the operation of a port in the United States. The curr_chunk defines terms related to safeguards, security investigations, defense research and development, port authority, repository, and spent nuclear fuel."
