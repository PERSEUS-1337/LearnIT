It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws require certain coverage terms to be equal between mental health services and medical services. The federal mental health parity requirements, established by the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, mandate that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services must be on par with medical and surgical services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not alter these requirements.

It also requires the establishment of Exchanges for health coverage. The ACA expanded federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. Exchanges were established for purchasing health insurance, with QHPs required to comply with federal parity law. The ACA requires all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to comply with federal parity law in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. QHPs will be available in both the small group and individual markets, and must also comply with federal parity law if offered outside of an Exchange. Additionally, plans offered through the individual market must also comply with federal parity law. Medicaid may be offered in the form of traditional state plans. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to partially comply with federal parity law, which may be provided through managed care plans.

Plans offered in the Exchanges must meet certain requirements, including offering a minimum set of services. The ACA requires the establishment of Exchanges where individuals and employers can purchase health insurance. Plans offered in the Exchanges, known as QHPs, must include a minimum set of benefits called the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP), which includes Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified tiers of coverage. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for defining the items and services included in the EHBP. The Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) under the ACA includes Essential Health Benefits (EHB), cost-sharing arrangements, and specified tiers of coverage. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines the items and services in the EHB, which must include 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The benefits in the EHB must be of \"equal scope\" to those offered by a typical employer. The EHB includes 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. Benefits must be comparable to those offered by a typical employer plan, as determined by a survey conducted by the Department of Labor. The ACA required the Department of Labor to survey employer-sponsored coverage to determine benefits covered under a typical employer plan. A report released by DOL found that most health plans offer inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment, although specific services are not mandated as part of the Essential Health Benefits. The report for the Department of Labor to the Department of Health and Human Services found that most health plans surveyed offer inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The ACA does not require specific mental health and substance use disorder services to be included as part of the Essential Health Benefits. The specific services included in the Essential Health Benefits Package will be determined through the rulemaking process. The Essential Health Benefits (EHB) will be determined through the rulemaking process, with the HHS Secretary having discretion to include additional benefits. In December 2011, HHS released an informational bulletin outlining their approach to defining essential health benefits. In December 2011, HHS released an informational bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define Essential Health Benefits using benchmark health insurance plans.
