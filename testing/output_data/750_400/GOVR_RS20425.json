    "content": "The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) builds upon the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) regarding consumer access to television signals via satellite dishes. Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming through satellite dishes. EchoStar's Dish TV, DirecTV, NRTC, Pegasus Communications, and Rainbow DBS offer satellite TV services. Voom, a service by Rainbow DBS, provides a smaller number of satellite channels. Historical information on SHVA and the revisions made by Congress can be found in CRS Report 98-942. The 1999 law SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming through satellite dishes. It permits the rebroadcast of local and distant network signals, with satellite companies having the option to rebroadcast local signals back into the same market area. The distinction between local and distant network signals is crucial for understanding SHVIA. The 1999 law SHVIA allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local and distant network signals. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals are from elsewhere in the country. Satellite companies have the option to rebroadcast local signals back into the same market area. The SHVIA law allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local and distant network signals. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals are from elsewhere in the country. Consumers living inside the Grade B contour may not receive distant network signals via satellite. The SHVIA law allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local and distant network signals. Consumers living inside the Grade B contour may not receive distant network signals via satellite, leading to court challenges by networks. Over 2 million consumers reportedly had access to distant network signals despite the restrictions. In 1998, court challenges arose as some satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to over 2 million consumers having their signals terminated. EchoStar appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. Congress \"grandfathered\" consumers illegally receiving distant network signals in 1999 law. In 1998, court challenges arose as some satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to over 2 million consumers having their signals terminated. EchoStar appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. Congress \"grandfathered\" consumers illegally receiving distant network signals in 1999 law. New subscribers must meet Grade B signal intensity requirements to receive distant network signals. New subscribers must meet Grade B signal intensity requirements to receive distant network signals, as determined by the FCC in February 1999. Consumers who believe they are not receiving the required signal may seek a waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite. The FCC concluded that the Grade B standard should still be used for SHVIA purposes. Consumers can seek a waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite if they believe they are not receiving a Grade A or Grade B signal. They must apply to their satellite company for the waiver, which is then forwarded to the local network affiliate. The affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. Consumers can request a waiver from their satellite company to receive distant network signals. The local network affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. If approved, consumers can receive the distant network signals, if denied, they can request a signal intensity test at no cost. If a waiver is granted by the affiliate, consumers can receive distant network signals from the satellite company. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test at no cost, with the test expenses covered by the \"loser\" (either the satellite company or the affiliate). Exceptions apply for recreational vehicles and commercial trucks. Consumers can receive distant network signals at no cost if a waiver is granted by the affiliate. If denied, they can request a free signal intensity test, with the expenses covered by the \"loser\" (either the satellite company or the affiliate). Exceptions apply for recreational vehicles and commercial trucks. Consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from the local affiliate, have a satellite dish on an RV or commercial truck, or had illegal signals terminated under 1998 court rulings. The SHVIA permits DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service for consumers using \"C-band\" dishes, allowing them to receive distant network signals indefinitely if they were receiving them before October 31, 1999. Miami court rulings do not require DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service for consumers using \"C-band\" dishes. These consumers may receive distant network signals indefinitely if they were receiving them before October 31, 1999. The law also created a \"must carry\" provision, but it does not mandate DBS companies to offer this service. The law does not require DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service, where a local broadcast TV signal is transmitted via satellite to consumers in the same designated market area. However, under the \"must carry\" provision, if a DBS provider chooses to offer local broadcast programming in a market, it must carry all local TV stations in that market. The \"must carry\" provision requires DBS companies to provide all local broadcast stations in a particular market if they offer any local station in that market. This does not apply nationwide, but only in markets where local broadcast programming is provided. Cable companies were already subject to similar rules based on the size of their systems. The \"must carry\" provision for DBS companies requires them to carry all local TV stations in a market that want to be carried, with exceptions for duplicative programming and educational stations. This rule went into effect on January 1, 2002, and DBS companies like EchoStar and DirecTV have opposed it but have expanded their local-into-local service in multiple markets. The must-carry provisions for DBS companies went into effect on January 1, 2002. EchoStar and DirecTV have expanded their local-into-local service in multiple markets, with plans to add more as capacity allows. Many smaller communities in the US do not receive local signals via satellite due to the 210 designated market areas (DMAs) identified by Nielsen Media Research. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local service in multiple markets, with plans to add more as capacity allows. There are 210 designated market areas (DMAs) in the United States, with differences in size affecting the percentage of the population able to receive local signals via satellite. EchoStar has passed the 100 DMA mark, reaching 83% of the population, while DirecTV aims to cover at least 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, representing 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed by Congress in 2000 to help ensure coverage in small and rural areas. DirecTV plans to provide local-into-local service in at least 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, covering 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure coverage in small and rural areas without access to local television via satellite or terrestrial technologies. Compensation for copyright on programming is also an issue in satellite retransmission. The 2000 LOCAL Act was passed to provide local television access to small and rural areas unable to receive local-into-local service from EchoStar or DirecTV. Satellite carriers were granted a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals, ensuring programming availability at government-set prices. Under the 1988 and 1999 laws, satellite carriers were granted a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals at government-set prices. The 1999 law extended the license for distant network signals until 2004, with the 108th Congress considering further extensions and price-setting changes. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering further extensions and price-setting changes. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. Congress granted satellite companies and cable providers permanent compulsory copyright licenses. Satellite companies can offer local-into-local television service and must comply with must-carry requirements starting January 1, 2002. Syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication rules apply to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Sports blackout applies to network stations if technically feasible and not economically. Satellite companies are required to offer local-into-local television service and comply with must-carry requirements starting January 1, 2002. Syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication rules apply to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision can have their signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. The new regulations allow subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision to have their signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004, preserving Grade B signal intensity standard for receiving distant network signals. Subscribers unable to receive Grade B signals can receive up to two distant network signals per television network per day. The new regulations allow subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision to retain Grade B signal intensity standard for receiving distant network signals. Subscribers unable to receive Grade B signals can receive up to two distant network signals per television network per day, with a process in place for seeking waivers from local affiliates if signal strength is in doubt. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The new regulations allow consumers to seek waivers from local affiliates to receive distant network signals if signal strength is in doubt, at no cost. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The existing satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals is extended until December 31, 2004, with reduced copyright royalty payments for satellite companies. The new regulations extend the existing satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals until December 31, 2004. It also creates a new compulsory license for local network signals with no sunset date. The copyright royalty payments for satellite companies are reduced by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. No copyright fees may be charged for local signals. The regulations eliminate the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers and allow satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. After that, local PBS stations must be carried in markets where local-into-local service is provided. The regulations allow satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002, with local PBS stations required in markets where local-into-local service is provided. In 1999, a proposed loan guarantee program to benefit subscribers in small and rural markets was removed from the final version of the bill due to objections by Senator Gramm. The conference version of H.R. 1554 aimed to create a loan guarantee program to benefit subscribers in small and rural markets, but it was removed before final passage due to objections by Senator Gramm. Congress later passed the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) as part of the FY2001 appropriations act, which established a board to oversee loan guarantees. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed by Congress as part of the FY2001 appropriations act, creating a board to oversee loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion for building systems to ensure nationwide access to local television signals. The LOCAL Act created a board to select recipients for loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion to build systems for nationwide access to local TV signals, prioritizing underserved areas and high-speed Internet access. The act is technology neutral but limits eligibility for cable companies. The Board created by the LOCAL Act considers projects serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas for high-speed Internet access. The act is technology neutral and limits eligibility for cable companies. Regulations were issued for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003, with one application received and returned by the Board in May 2004. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003, with one incomplete application received in May 2004. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service in the Department of Agriculture, which received $280 million in funding for the program. The Board rescinded a decision to open another 60-day application period for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program. The program, administered by the Rural Utilities Service, received $280 million in funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. Section 6404 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act allocated $80 million for the program. The program's slow progress was criticized in a report by the GAO. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act allocated $80 million for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program and stressed the need for accurate reporting of administrative costs. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required FCC to conduct tests through an independent entity. The GAO reports emphasized the need for accurate reporting of administrative costs by the FCC to meet federal requirements. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required independent testing to determine potential interference between terrestrial systems and DBS satellites in the same frequency band. The \"Northpoint provision\" mandated independent testing to assess interference between terrestrial systems and DBS satellites in the 12.2-12.7 GHz frequency band. Northpoint Technology's subsidiary, Broadwave, aims to offer TV programming and data services through a terrestrial wireless system known as MVDDS. The FCC selected the MITRE Corporation in 2001 to conduct these interference tests. The FCC selected the MITRE Corporation in 2001 to conduct interference tests between MVDDS and DBS systems in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. The report concluded that MVDDS would cause interference to DBS operations, but mitigating steps could be taken. The FCC selected the MITRE Corporation in 2001 to conduct interference tests between MVDDS and DBS systems in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. The report concluded that MVDDS would cause interference to DBS operations, but mitigating steps could be taken. The FCC decided that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist, but dismissed applications by Northpoint and two other companies to provide MVDDS, opting to auction the frequencies instead. Northpoint objected to this decision and did not participate in the auction, which was completed on January 27, 2004. The FCC decided that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist, but dismissed applications by Northpoint and two other companies to provide MVDDS, opting to auction the frequencies instead. Northpoint objected to this decision and did not participate in the auction. Other companies participated in the auction, which raised $118.7 million. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. The auction for frequencies in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band raised $118.7 million on January 27, 2004. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services other than mobile phones in this band."
