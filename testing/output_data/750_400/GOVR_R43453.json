    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount for 2017 and 2018 is 2.4 cents per kWh, adjusted annually for inflation. Wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualify for the maximum credit amount. The maximum credit amount for 2013-2016 was 2.3 cents per kWh, increasing to 2.4 cents per kWh for 2017-2018. The credit rate is adjusted annually for inflation. Different renewable energy technologies qualify for varying credit amounts, with some receiving a reduced credit. Nonwind facilities that began construction before January 1, 2018, are eligible for the credit. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) offers varying credit amounts for different renewable energy technologies. Nonwind facilities that started construction before January 1, 2018, are eligible for the credit. Wind facilities must begin construction before January 1, 2020, to qualify for the full credit. The credit amount is reduced by 20% for facilities starting construction in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 60% thereafter. Construction for wind facilities must begin before January 1, 2020, to qualify for the Production Tax Credit (PTC). The credit amount decreases by 20% for facilities starting construction in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 60% in 2019. The PTC is set to phase out once the market price of electricity exceeds certain levels. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind facilities decreases by 20% for construction starting in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 60% in 2019. The PTC will phase out if electricity prices exceed certain levels, but this has not happened yet. The PTC was also limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) before 2018. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind facilities decreases annually and will phase out if electricity prices exceed certain levels. The PTC was previously limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) before 2018. Before 2018, the PTC was available for taxpayers subject to the AMT for the first four years of the credit. The corporate AMT limitation was significant for affected firms but was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) from 2009 to 2017. The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97), allowing PTC-eligible taxpayers to claim the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) from 2009 to 2017. Additionally, there are production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific requirements for eligibility. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant allowed taxpayers to claim tax benefits or grants. Production tax credits are available for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific eligibility requirements. Indian coal facilities must have been in service before January 1, 2009, to receive credits for coal produced before January 1, 2016. There is no placed-in-service limitation for coal produced and sold after December 31, 2015. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. Refined coal has a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton. The production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal have specific eligibility requirements. Indian coal facilities must have been in service before January 1, 2009, to receive credits for coal produced before January 1, 2016. There is no placed-in-service limitation for coal produced and sold after December 31, 2015. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. For refined coal, the base credit amount is $4.375 per ton, and the 2018 credit with the inflation adjustment is $7.307 per ton. Refined coal facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for refined coal facilities requires them to be in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits. The PTC has been extended 11 times since its enactment in 1992, with lapses before reinstatement. Initially available for wind or closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC has evolved over time. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92; P.L. 102-486) and has been extended 11 times since then. Initially available for wind or closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC has evolved over time, with extensions through various legislative acts. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since its inception in 1992. The PTC was initially set to expire on June 30, 1999 but has been extended through various legislative acts, adding qualifying technologies like poultry waste and open-loop biomass. The PTC was extended through December 31, 2005 by the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. Later legislation in the 108th Congress made substantial modifications to the PTC. The PTC has been extended multiple times since 1992, with the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extending it through December 31, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 added new qualifying resources like open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste, with a five-year PTC period for these resources. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 added new qualifying resources for the Production Tax Credit (PTC), such as biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These resources were limited to a five-year PTC period, with reduced credit amounts for some facilities. Additionally, a PTC for refined coal was introduced at a rate of $4.375 per ton, available until January 1, 2009. The PTC was extended twice during the 109th Congress. The AJCA introduced a PTC for refined coal at $4.375 per ton, extended twice during the 109th Congress. EPACT05 extended the PTC for most facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. Hydropower was a half-credit qualifying resource, while Indian coal could qualify for a credit over seven years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for most facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, added hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources, and extended the credit period from 5 years to 10 years for qualifying facilities placed in service after August 8, 2005. Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years and $2.00 per ton for the last three years, adjusted for inflation. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended for qualifying facilities, excluding solar, refined coal, and Indian coal, through various acts such as EPACT05, Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The credit period was extended to 10 years for facilities placed in service after August 8, 2005, with varying credit amounts per ton over a seven-year period. The PTC was extended through various acts, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, for wind, refined coal, and other qualifying facilities until 2010. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were added as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The PTC for various renewable energy sources was extended through 2010, including closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. EESA also added marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as qualifying resources and introduced a new credit for steel industry fuel at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The PTC for steel industry fuel was set at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent, with a credit available for facilities producing fuel before October 1, 2008. The credit was extended through 2010 for various renewable energy sources, including wind and other technologies, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the option for PTC-eligible taxpayers to choose a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) instead. Additionally, the Act created the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in place of tax credits. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind and other renewable energy technologies. It also introduced the option for taxpayers to choose a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and created the Section 1603 grant program for receiving a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits. The program was available for property placed in service or under construction in 2009 or 2010, and was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which also changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and ITC options were retroactively extended through 2014. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and ITC options were retroactively extended through 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through the end of 2016. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, with the expiration date changed to a construction start date. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through the end of 2016, along with extensions for ITC and production credits for Indian coal facilities. The production credit for Indian coal facilities was extended through 2016, with the placed-in-service limitation removed. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019, with reduced credits for facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019 with reduced credits for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were retroactively extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Without further legislative action, these credits will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Revenue losses are estimated between 2018 and 2022. The PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. These credits will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with most of it ($24.0 billion) attributed to the PTC for wind energy. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC are $25.8 billion, with most of it ($24.0 billion) attributed to wind energy. Other PTCs include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower, totaling $1.7 billion. Additionally, production credits for refined coal and Indian coal account for $0.1 billion each over the same period. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law. The estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with wind energy accounting for $24.0 billion. Other PTCs include geothermal, biomass, municipal solid waste, and hydropower, totaling $1.7 billion. Production credits for refined coal and Indian coal each account for $0.1 billion over the same period. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law, and further extension of the PTC would increase these estimates. For 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the PTC for renewable electricity production, totaling $2.8 billion. Most PTCs awarded are from previous-year investments, and some taxpayers may carry credits forward if not used in a given tax year. In 2013, taxpayers claimed $2.8 billion in PTCs for renewable electricity production. Unused credits can be carried forward to offset tax liability in future years, with nearly $1.2 billion carried forward in 2010. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims. In 2010, nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years, highlighting the impact of policy actions on renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009, with fewer taxpayers opting for the Section 1603 grant option instead. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. After 2009, the number of taxpayers claiming the PTC decreased due to the availability of the Section 1603 grant option. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that could have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn also led to a significant increase in tax credit carry forwards between 2008 and 2010. The economic downturn led to a significant increase in tax credit carry forwards between 2008 and 2010, as taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits. Weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy project developers to establish partnerships to monetize tax credits. Other estimates provide information on the cost of a long-term PTC extension. During the economic downturn, tax credit carry forwards increased significantly between 2008 and 2010. Weakness in tax equity markets made it difficult for renewable energy developers to monetize tax credits. Estimates show that extending the PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028, while extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion during the same period. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion during the same period. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The PTC was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources. Recent extensions of the PTC reflect a belief that the tax incentives contribute to the development of renewable energy, with an estimated $6.9 billion reduction in federal revenues between 2018 and 2027. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended in 1999 to promote renewable energy development, reflecting Congress's belief in its importance for environmentally friendly power. Research shows the PTC drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions limit its potential impact on infrastructure expansion. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions limit its impact on infrastructure expansion. Further extension of the PTC may lead to more investment and growth, but retroactive extensions can provide windfall benefits to taxpayers. The PTC has increased the use of renewable electricity resources, but its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions limit its impact on infrastructure expansion. Retroactive extensions can provide windfall benefits to taxpayers. Research on the PTC's contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. Recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to renewable energy growth. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would lead to a small increase in power-sector emissions. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar help reduce emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is often justified by the presence of externalities, such as pollution from energy production and consumption. Tax credits for wind and solar help reduce emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by externalities like pollution, leading to market failures. Tax subsidies for clean energy are a policy option to address these issues. The costs of pollution are borne by society as a whole, not just energy producers and consumers. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option for addressing inefficiencies in the energy sector, but they may not be the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective. Subsidies can reduce the average cost of energy, encouraging consumption and offsetting emissions reductions. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources may not be the most efficient policy option. They reduce energy costs, encourage consumption, counter conservation efforts, favor costly emissions reductions, and decrease tax revenues, impacting economic efficiency. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources may not efficiently incentivize emissions reductions, favoring costly options and reducing tax revenues. A more direct and economically efficient approach would be a carbon tax to address pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector. A carbon tax is a more efficient approach to addressing pollution in the energy sector, generating revenues to offset taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy projects. A carbon tax approach is more efficient for addressing pollution in the energy sector and generating revenues to offset taxes or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy projects, as they often require outside investors to monetize tax benefits. This reduces the amount of federal financial support directly to the renewable energy sector. Tax equity financing arrangements involve outside investors monetizing tax benefits to support renewable energy projects. This reduces direct federal financial support to the renewable energy sector. Production-based tax incentives can lead to more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. The interaction of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) with other policies like Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) is crucial for supporting renewable electricity development in the US. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with other policies like Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) to support renewable electricity development in the US. Without legislative action, the PTC is not available to certain projects after specific dates. One option is to allow the PTC to expire as scheduled. Subsidies for renewable energy at the federal level, including the PTC, can reduce the cost of complying with state-level RPS mandates. Options for the PTC include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with an extended construction start date deadline. Options for the Production Tax Credit (PTC) include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with an extended construction start date deadline. The expiration date for the PTC for wind is different than for other technologies, so Congress may choose to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018. If extended, the phaseout that currently applies to wind could be applied to other technologies. Enactment of P.L. 114-113 resulted in different expiration dates for the PTC for wind and other technologies. Congress may extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018. Options include applying the phaseout currently in place for wind to other technologies or removing the phaseout for wind so all PTC-eligible technologies qualify at the same rate. In 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout as part of his tax reform proposal. The proposal aimed to eliminate the PTC inflation adjustment factor, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for all eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would affect facilities that had previously received a 2.3 cent per kWh PTC in 2014. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed by Chairman Camp aimed to eliminate the PTC inflation adjustment factor, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would impact facilities that had previously received a 2.3 cent per kWh PTC in 2014. The proposal also included a full repeal of the PTC after 2024. Under Chairman Camp's proposal, the PTC for renewable electricity would have been reduced to 1.5 cents per kWh for existing facilities within their 10-year window, with a full repeal planned after 2024. The JCT estimated this would generate $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget suggested a permanent extension of the PTC. JCT estimated that a proposal to modify the PTC would raise $9.6 billion in federal revenues from 2014 to 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and including solar facilities as qualifying property. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC. In President Obama's FY2017 budget proposal, the PTC would be made refundable, solar facilities added as qualifying property, and renewable electricity consumed by producers could qualify for tax credits. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC. The ITC for renewable energy would be made permanent, with a cost estimated at $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
