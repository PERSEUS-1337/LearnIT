    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Act is titled the \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" and Congress finds that the Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps and required deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. The threat of cuts was meant to encourage lawmakers to find alternative solutions. The threat of draconian cuts through sequestration was intended to push lawmakers to negotiate a balanced package of revenue increases and targeted spending cuts. Despite unsuccessful negotiations, a sequester occurred in fiscal year 2013, leading to a two-year agreement with higher defense and discretionary spending levels. The initial sequester in fiscal year 2013 led to a two-year agreement with higher defense and non-defense discretionary spending levels for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. A similar agreement is needed now to avoid deep budget cuts in the upcoming fiscal year. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry are advocating for this agreement. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry are advocating for a new agreement to avoid deep budget cuts in the upcoming fiscal year, criticizing the impact of sequestration on defense spending and military capabilities. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry are criticizing the impact of sequestration on defense spending, stating that the cuts are undermining the capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization of the armed forces. The senior military leaders have testified that with defense spending at sequestration levels, they cannot execute the National Military Strategy. Additionally, the impact of the cuts on non-defense discretionary (NDD) spending is becoming increasingly clear.

The impact of sequestration includes hindering scientific discovery, eroding infrastructure, and threatening emergency response capabilities. The House Committee on Appropriations' bills for fiscal year 2016 propose cuts to the Department of Education, housing vouchers, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The sequester proposes cuts to education by $2.8 billion, housing vouchers, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, increasing employment by 500,000 next year. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, increasing employment by 500,000 next year. Providing relief from the sequester would also allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation before the fiscal year starts, preventing a government shutdown. Relief from the sequester would prevent a government shutdown, as seen in the 16-day shutdown in 2013 which cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs and reduced GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%. 6.6 million days' worth of work were lost through furloughs of Federal employees during that time. In 2013, a government shutdown cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs and reduced GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%. It resulted in 6.6 million days' worth of work lost through furloughs, $500 million in visitor spending lost in national parks, $4 billion in delayed tax refunds, 6,300 children losing access to Head Start, and delayed food safety inspections. To prevent another government shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016, negotiations are needed to raise discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. This is crucial as the previous shutdown resulted in significant economic losses, including job cuts, reduced GDP growth, lost visitor spending, delayed tax refunds, children losing access to Head Start, and postponed food safety inspections. Immediate negotiations are necessary to raise discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. Congress should aim to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing special interest tax loopholes, but sequester relief must occur regardless of this agreement. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed within one day of the Act's enactment.
