    "content": "Bankruptcy filings since 1980 peaked in 1987 for business filings, while consumer filings continued to rise until 2005. The number of filings surpassed 2 million in 2005 before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 took effect. Filings dropped sharply in 2006, indicating a rush to file before the new law. Filings then rose steadily until 2010, exceeding 1.5 million. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 led to a sharp drop in filings in 2006, as many accelerated their petitions before the law took effect. Filings rose steadily until 2010, exceeding 1.5 million. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, accounting for about 97% of all household debt. Household debt saw a slight decline in the first three quarters of 2011 after exceeding 1.5 million in 2010. Mortgage debt and consumer credit make up about 97% of all household indebtedness, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Household debt consists mainly of mortgage debt and consumer credit, which make up about 97% of all household indebtedness. Consumer credit includes revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with a subcategory of home equity lending. Federal Reserve estimates show the burden of debt service, the percentage of household disposable income used to repay loans, has been steadily rising over the past decade. The table includes Federal Reserve estimates of the burden of debt service, which has been steadily rising over the past decade. The debt burden figures fluctuate within a narrow range, from 10.80% to 13.93%, showing a gradual increase since the 1980s. This increase does not explain the significant rise in household indebtedness. The debt burden figures in Table 2 have fluctuated within a narrow range from 10.80% to 13.93% since the 1980s. Despite a gradual increase in debt burden, it does not explain the fivefold increase in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have declined to the lowest levels since the 1950s, remaining low. The debt burden has remained relatively stable despite falling interest rates, leading to an increase in the ratio of debt to income. This has not significantly impacted the rise in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades. The ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising despite low interest rates since the 1950s. This increase in debt relative to income could lead to more bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. The increase in debt relative to income since the 1950s could lead to more bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. Household debt has risen significantly between 1990 and 2007, outpacing the growth of the debt burden. This trend may pose problems for lenders in the future. Household debt numbers hide disparities among families, with some thriving in the 1980s and 1990s booms while others struggle to repay their debts. The increase in household debt since the 1950s could lead to more bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. Some families have thrived in the 1980s and 1990s booms, while others struggle to repay their debts. Lower-income families are the most likely to file for bankruptcy due to high levels of distress. The Survey of Consumer Finances from 1995 to 2007 shows high distress rates among lower-income families, who are more likely to file for bankruptcy. There is no clear trend explaining the increase in bankruptcy filings, with little change in distress levels from 1998 to 2007. However, there is a notable increase in distress among families in the upper income percentiles in 2007. The 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances shows high distress rates among lower-income families, who are more likely to file for bankruptcy. There is no clear trend explaining the increase in bankruptcy filings, with little change in distress levels from 1998 to 2007. However, there is a notable increase in distress among families in the upper income percentiles in 2007, possibly due to increased mortgage debt taken on during the housing boom. The question remains why many families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt and end up in bankruptcy court.

The question remains why many families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt and end up in bankruptcy court. Some explanations focus on vulnerable populations like the sick, uninsured, divorced, or residents of states without mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, creating an incentive to borrow beyond the ability to repay. Opponents claimed that financial incentives were the cause. In 2005, bankruptcy reform was enacted to address concerns that the bankruptcy code was too debtor-friendly, leading to excessive borrowing. Supporters argued that it created an incentive to borrow beyond one's means, while opponents blamed financial distress on the marketing strategies of credit card issuers. The lack of a consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings indicates that the issue will remain controversial. The U.S. economy entered a recession in December 2007 amidst global financial panic, further exacerbating household debt issues. In December 2007, the U.S. economy went into recession, leading to a decline in household debt levels. The decrease in debt balances continued for 11 quarters, with a slight rise in the second quarter of 2011 followed by another fall in the third quarter. Home equity and credit card debt were the main contributors to the decline. Household debt levels fell for 11 quarters following the 2007 recession, with home equity and credit card debt leading the decline. Factors contributing to the decrease include debt repayment, reduced borrowing, and increased debt write-offs by lenders. Household debt levels fell for 11 quarters following the 2007 recession, with mortgage debt leading the decline. Factors contributing to the decrease include debt repayment, reduced borrowing, increased debt write-offs, tightened credit standards, mortgage modifications, and foreclosures. Causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt. Household debt levels fell for 11 quarters following the 2007 recession, with mortgage debt leading the decline. Some lenders have tightened credit standards for new loans, leading to decreased mortgage balances due to modifications, negotiations, and foreclosures.
