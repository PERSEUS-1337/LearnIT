    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Concerns arose in 2013 about the FISC's orders, leading to proposals to amend FISA or FISC practices. Many proposals have been introduced to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the practices of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) following concerns about government surveillance orders in 2013. This report specifically focuses on proposals to change the process of selecting judges for the FISA courts, as outlined in Article III of the U.S. Constitution. The report focuses on proposals to change the process for selecting judges for the FISA courts, as outlined in Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Federal judges presiding over Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished during their terms in office to ensure independence from political interference. The FISC, an Article III court, is authorized to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations, ensuring independence from political interference. The FISC, established by Congress under FISA, is authorized to issue orders for foreign intelligence investigations, including electronic surveillance and access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review denials of FISC applications. The FISC can approve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, and access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC application denials. The Chief Justice designates federal judges for the FISC and Court of Review, serving seven-year terms without eligibility for reappointment. The FISC has 11 district court judges selected from at least seven judicial circuits, with one as the presiding judge. The U.S. Supreme Court designates federal judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review, serving seven-year terms without reappointment. The FISC has 11 district court judges selected from at least seven judicial circuits, with one as the presiding judge. Some argue against the sole authority of the Chief Justice in selecting judges. The FISA Court of Review is composed of three judges selected by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Critics argue that the selection process is too partisan, leading to proposed bills in Congress to change the selection method, such as transferring authority to the chief judges of the circuit courts. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process for selecting FISA judges, including proposals to give selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or the President with Senate advice and consent. The main issue raised by these proposals is the designation of judges by a specific branch of government. The bill proposes changes to the selection process of FISA judges, with different proposals suggesting the Chief Justice, President, or congressional leadership to have the authority. The main concern is the constitutionality of designating judges by a specific branch of government, with the judicial branch expressing reservations about shifting selection away from the Chief Justice in 2014. The report discusses the constitutionality of designating judges by a specific branch of government, with the judicial branch expressing concerns about proposals to shift selection away from the Chief Justice in 2014. It reviews the process of appointing Article III judges and explores how a reviewing court might assess the constitutionality of proposals that shift designation authority. The report examines the constitutionality of designating judges by different branches of government, including proposals to shift selection authority away from the Chief Justice. It also explores how a reviewing court might assess the constitutionality of these proposals under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The report explores proposals to shift selection authority for judges away from the Chief Justice and examines the constitutionality of these proposals under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which dictates how certain government officials must be appointed. The Supreme Court has indicated that all Article III judges are principal officers and must adhere to the strictures of the Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court has indicated that all Article III judges are principal officers and must adhere to the strictures of the Appointments Clause, which dictates how certain government officials must be appointed. If Congress expands the duties of an office for which one must be constitutionally appointed, it may not be necessary for an incumbent to receive a second appointment if the additional duties are related to the official's original government post. The Supreme Court has ruled that if Congress expands the duties of an office requiring constitutional appointment, a second appointment may not be necessary if the additional duties are related to the original government post. This principle was reaffirmed in Weiss v. United States, where military officers could serve on a military court without a second appointment if the duties were germane to their original appointment. In Weiss v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that military officers could serve on a military court without a second constitutional appointment if the duties were related to their original appointment. The principle of \"germaneness\" from Shoemaker v. United States was cited, stating that Congress can increase the power and duties of an existing office without requiring a new appointment. The Supreme Court in Weiss v. United States affirmed that Congress can expand the powers of an existing office without necessitating a new appointment. This principle applies to the designation of federal judges to serve in related Article III capacities, without violating the Appointments Clause. Congress has a history of using designations for Article III courts, with the Chief Justice having the authority to make temporary assignments. The Supreme Court has addressed the constitutionality of designating federal judges to serve in related Article III capacities. Congress has a history of using designations for Article III courts, with the Chief Justice having the authority to make temporary assignments. The creation of the now-defunct Commerce Court is an example where the Chief Justice was empowered to designate federal judges to a special tribunal. The Chief Justice has the authority to temporarily assign federal judges to serve on specialized tribunals, such as the now-defunct Commerce Court. This process of designation by the Chief Justice has been a model for future specialized courts, like the FISA courts. The Chief Justice can designate federal judges to serve on specialized tribunals, like the Commerce Court, which has influenced future courts such as the FISA courts. Congress has also given lower federal court judges designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, as seen in McDowell v. United States. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, as seen in McDowell v. United States, where it stated that the power of Congress to designate one District Judge to temporarily discharge duties in another district is valid and does not trespass upon the executive power of appointment. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power to designate one District Judge to temporarily discharge duties in another district, stating that it does not violate the executive power of appointment. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power to designate one District Judge to temporarily discharge duties in another district, stating that it does not violate the executive power of appointment. The Court in Lamar v. United States similarly dismissed a constitutional challenge to the Chief Justice's designation authority with respect to district court judges, declaring the argument unsound. The constitutionality of the designation of FISA judges has also been upheld in court cases. The Court rejected the defendant's argument that the designation of FISA judges violated the Appointments Clause, stating the argument was unsound. Other courts have also upheld the constitutionality of this process, such as in United States v. Cavanagh where the Ninth Circuit rejected a similar argument. In United States v. Cavanagh, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that the FISC violates the Appointments Clause by Chief Justice designation of judges instead of presidential appointment with Senate confirmation. The court cited precedent supporting temporary assignment of judges by the Chief Justice for specialized courts. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are term-limited. The court in Lamar v. United States upheld the temporary assignment of district court judges by the Chief Justice, citing substantial precedent for such assignments. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges who are designated to temporarily serve on other courts. The central issue raised by proposals to alter who selects FISA judges is whether designation by certain individuals within different branches of government would be constitutional. The FISA judges are not different from other federal judges designated to serve temporarily on other courts. The key issue is the constitutionality of proposals to change who selects FISA judges. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act would disperse the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice, increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC among 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice, increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit from which a vacancy arises. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit from which a vacancy arises. Additionally, S. 1460 would require at least five associate justices of the Supreme Court to concur in the Chief Justice's designation for the FISA Court of Review. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit from which a vacancy arises. S. 1460 would require at least five associate justices of the Supreme Court to concur in the Chief Justice's designation for the FISA Court of Review. The Chief Justice would still have the final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts under this proposal. Limited judicial precedent suggests that allowing others within the judicial branch to designate FISA judges could be constitutionally acceptable. The Chief Justice would retain final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts under the proposed reform. Limited judicial precedent indicates that allowing others within the judicial branch to designate FISA judges could be constitutionally acceptable. The Court in McDowell suggested that Congress has the authority to determine how and where judges may exercise jurisdiction, including allowing District Judges to temporarily discharge duties in another district. This is based on Congress's power to establish courts and the lack of constitutional restrictions on a District Judge's territorial limits. This implies that Congress can vest chief judges with certain powers. The McDowell case established that Congress has the authority to determine the jurisdiction of judges, including allowing District Judges to fulfill duties in other districts. This is based on Congress's power to establish courts and the absence of constitutional restrictions on a District Judge's territorial limits. This implies that Congress can grant chief judges broad authority to designate judges within their circuits to serve on FISA courts, despite modern statutes limiting this authority. The McDowell case established Congress's authority to determine judges' jurisdiction, including allowing District Judges to serve in other districts. This implies that Congress can grant chief judges broad authority to designate judges within their circuits for FISA courts. However, modern statutes limit this authority, leading to proposals to shift designation authority to the President. For example, the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761) aims to do so. The McDowell case established Congress's authority to determine judges' jurisdiction, including allowing District Judges to serve in other districts. This implies that Congress can grant chief judges broad authority to designate judges within their circuits for FISA courts. Other proposals would shift authority to designate FISA court judges to the President, such as the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761). The Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761) would allow the President to \"designate\" judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review, potentially raising questions about the FISA courts' status as Article III courts due to the difference in appointment terms. The Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761) proposes to \"designate\" judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review, which could impact the courts' status as Article III courts. FISA judges serve seven-year terms, unlike Article III judges who have life tenure. However, precedent suggests that life tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary rather than the specific court they are appointed to. Based on precedent, life tenure protects a judge's position on the federal judiciary, not the specific court they are appointed to. This could apply to federal judges serving on the FISA courts for a fixed term. A federal judge appointed to the FISA courts for a fixed term does not lose their Article III status or protections. However, giving the President sole authority to select a federal judge for the FISA courts could raise separation-of-powers concerns. The President's power to select a federal judge for the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns, but Mistretta v. United States established that the President can appoint judges to independent agencies within the judicial branch. The President's limited power to remove a judge from the U.S. Sentencing Commission does not affect their tenure. The separation-of-powers doctrine does not prevent the President from appointing judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency within the judicial branch. The President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties. If a federal judge is removed from the FISA courts, they would still serve as an Article III judge on a district or circuit court. The President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties. If a federal judge is removed from the FISA courts, they would still serve as an Article III judge on a district or circuit court. FISA judges exercise judicial powers on an Article III court, unlike judges in Mistretta who were acting in an extrajudicial capacity. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise legal questions. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove judges from the FISA courts could compromise their impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership. The President's power to select FISA judges alone raises separation-of-powers concerns, as it could influence judges' impartiality. Proposals suggest giving designation authority to congressional leadership, potentially conflicting with the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. The FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586) proposes allowing congressional leadership to designate judges to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, raising concerns about the Appointments Clause and separation of powers. Congress lacks authority to directly select appointees with significant authority under the laws of the United States, potentially conflicting with legal principles outlined in I.N.S. v. Chadha. Congress lacks authority under the Appointments Clause to directly select appointees with significant authority under the laws of the United States, which may conflict with legal principles outlined in I.N.S. v. Chadha. The Supreme Court in I.N.S. v. Chadha ruled that legislative acts altering legal rights must meet constitutional requirements. Congressional appointments to the judiciary without proper approval may violate the principles of Chadha."
