Environmentalists claim the sonar harms whales, causing beach strandings. The Navy issued an environmental assessment concluding minimal harm to marine mammals. Petitioners, mostly environmental groups, sought relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. The Navy issued an environmental assessment under NEPA, concluding minimal harm from using mid-frequency active sonar during training exercises. Petitioners, mostly environmental groups, sought relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. The district court initially granted a preliminary injunction, later modified to allow the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. On the Navy's second appeal, two mitigation measures were challenged. The district court initially granted a preliminary injunction against the Navy's training exercises using sonar. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, citing a possibility of irreparable injury and favoring the plaintiffs in terms of hardships. The Supreme Court ruled on November 12, 2008. The Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against the Navy's sonar training exercises, citing a possibility of irreparable injury and favoring the plaintiffs in terms of hardships. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show a likelihood of irreparable injury for an injunction to be issued. The Supreme Court ruled on November 12, 2008 that the Ninth Circuit's \"possibility\" test for a preliminary injunction is too lenient. The majority opinion, by conservative justices, stated that plaintiffs must show a \"likely\" irreparable injury for an injunction. The Court found that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed any potential harm to the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show a \"likely\" irreparable injury for an injunction, as the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals. The Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, indicating that the same balancing factor would apply to any future permanent injunction challenges. The Supreme Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, stating that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding violations of environmental laws. The Supreme Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, stating that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding violations of environmental laws. The Court emphasized the national security interest in the training exercises, suggesting that a final injunction should be rejected if the military is found to have violated an environmental statute. The Supreme Court reversed the decision to vacate the preliminary injunction, citing the Navy's national security interest in realistic training exercises. The Court suggested that a final injunction should be rejected if the military violated an environmental statute, despite the Ninth Circuit's environmentally friendly reputation. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions, citing national security interests in military training exercises. Forest Service regulations under the ARA were implemented without notice, comment, or appeals. The Forest Service implemented regulations under the ARA without notice, comment, or appeals, precluding them for projects covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA. This included salvage timber sales of 250 acres or less as categorical exclusions. The Forest Service implemented regulations under the ARA for projects covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA, including salvage timber sales of 250 acres or less. In 2003, a timber sale of 238 acres was approved without appeal due to the regulations, which were later invalidated by the district court. The district court invalidated regulations allowing a timber sale of 238 acres without appeal. The Ninth Circuit ruled that plaintiffs had standing due to procedural rights deprivation and reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests. The appeal prohibition claims were found ripe for review. The Ninth Circuit in v. Ruthenbeck, 490 F.3d 687 (9th Cir. 2007), found plaintiffs had standing due to injury in fact, including procedural rights deprivation and reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests. The court also ruled the appeal prohibition claims were ripe for review and invalidated conflicting regulations under the ARA. The Ninth Circuit found that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA, affirming the district court's decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Forest Service's promulgation of these regulations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Forest Service's regulations' enforcement, focusing on judicial review, standing, and ripeness of the challenges. The Supreme Court is reviewing the Forest Service's regulations' enforcement, focusing on judicial review, standing, and ripeness of challenges by environmental groups. The Supreme Court is reviewing the Forest Service's regulations' enforcement, focusing on judicial review, standing, and ripeness of challenges by environmental groups. The case involves the dismissal with prejudice, settlement between parties, and the Ninth Circuit's affirmation of a nationwide injunction issued by the district court. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, making the decision's outcome significant. Environmental groups face site-specific challenges in their efforts for program-wide reform. The outcome of the Supreme Court's decision on the enforcement of Forest Service regulations could have significant implications, potentially increasing the burden on public interest groups. The case involves the dismissal with prejudice, settlement, and affirmation of a nationwide injunction by the Ninth Circuit. The Court's conservative justices may take a restrictive view, impacting the ability of groups to challenge government programs. The Supreme Court's conservative justices may rule against a program that requires multiple lawsuits, impacting environmental groups' ability to challenge government programs. Power plants and industrial operations withdraw billions of gallons of water daily, harming aquatic organisms. Power plants and industrial operations withdraw billions of gallons of water daily to cool their facilities, resulting in the killing or injuring of billions of aquatic organisms every year. The Clean Water Act requires the use of the best technology available to minimize environmental impact from cooling water intake structures. EPA issued a rule in 2004 to govern cooling water intake. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the environmental impact of cooling water intake structures at power plants. In 2004, EPA issued a rule governing these structures, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available. However, in Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b). The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b) for cooling water intake structures at power plants. The court noted that facilities must adopt the best technology available without cost-benefit analysis. EPA can consider cost in other ways but not for determining the best technology under section 316(b). The Second Circuit ruled that facilities must adopt the best technology available for cooling water intake structures without cost-benefit analysis. EPA can consider cost in other ways but not for determining the best technology under section 316(b). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for minimizing environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The petition for certiorari questions whether CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to consider costs in determining the best technology for minimizing environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. There has been a shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in recent years. There has been resistance to cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws, but there is now a shift towards greater acceptance. The Supreme Court case will test if conservative justices will continue this shift, potentially legitimizing cost-benefit analysis in the Clean Water Act and federal pollution control statutes. The Supreme Court case will test if conservative justices will continue the shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws. Justice Breyer's past criticism of government regulation for not considering costs enough may play a role in the case. The case involves Coeur Alaska proposing to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater. Justice Breyer's past criticism of government regulation for not considering costs enough may influence the case. Coeur Alaska plans to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater by piping it to a nearby lake, which would kill all aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers determined the discharge falls under the Clean Water Act permit program. Coeur Alaska plans to dispose of 1,440 tons of tailings by piping it to a nearby lake in the national forest, which would kill all aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act, but conflicting regulations led to a legal challenge in Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting Clean Water Act regulations regarding Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge of \"fill material\" into U.S. waters. The Corps issued a section 404 permit in 2005 for the discharge from Coeur's gold mine, which would change the bottom elevation of the waters. EPA's new source performance standard under CWA also played a role in the legal challenge. The Corps and EPA define \"fill material\" as material placed in waters of the United States that changes the bottom elevation. The discharge from Coeur's gold mine would do this, and a \"404 permit\" has been issued. However, EPA's new standard prohibits discharges from Coeur Alaska's ore processing into U.S. waters, which must be incorporated into the mill's NPDES permit. The court concluded that the CWA's regulations apply to Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act requires Coeur Alaska's ore processing discharge to meet performance standards, even if it qualifies as \"fill material\" under Section 404. EPA's new standard prohibits such discharges into U.S. waters, mandating inclusion in the NPDES permit. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act requires Coeur Alaska's ore processing discharge to meet performance standards, even if it qualifies as \"fill material\" under Section 404. The court concluded that the Section 306 performance standard must apply through an NPDES permit, and that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008. The Corps' statements at the time of adopting the regulatory definition of \"fill material\" indicate that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008 to address the issue of permitting authority allocation between the Corps of Engineers and the EPA under the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008 to address the issue of permitting authority allocation between the Corps of Engineers and the EPA under the Clean Water Act. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009, with potential significant consequences if the Court allows the Corps to redefine \"fill material\" and remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address permitting authority allocation between the Corps of Engineers and the EPA under the Clean Water Act. The consequences of a potential reversal could be significant if the Court allows the Corps to redefine \"fill material\" and remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program. EPA and California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for a contaminated facility. The EPA and the state sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for a contaminated facility, holding liable past and present owners, operators, and transporters of hazardous substances. This included a defunct company that operated the facility and two railroads, including Burlington Northern. The EPA and the state sued past and present owners, operators, and transporters of a contaminated site under CERCLA. This included a defunct company, two railroads (including Burlington Northern), and Shell Oil Co. The district court found the railroads liable as owners and Shell liable as an \"arranger.\" The district court found two railroads and Shell Oil Co. liable for contamination at a site. The railroads were found liable as past and present owners, while Shell was found liable as an \"arranger.\" The court determined the railroads were responsible for 9% of total cleanup costs, and Shell was responsible for 6%. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of railroads and Shell for cleanup costs. The court found that the contamination could be apportioned, as some occurred before the railroads' parcel was part of the facility and only some toxic substances were stored there. The court addressed whether the railroads and Shell were liable for all cleanup costs or only some. It found that while the harm could be apportioned, neither party provided a reasonable basis for it. Additionally, the court considered whether Shell was liable as an \"arranger.\" The court found that neither the railroads nor Shell provided a reasonable basis for apportioning cleanup costs. Additionally, the court determined that Shell could be liable as an \"arranger\" under broader liability, not just direct arranger liability. The court found Shell liable as an \"arranger\" under broader liability, not just direct arranger liability, due to a transaction that involved disposal, leading to leakage. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of cleanup costs. Shell was found liable as an \"arranger\" under broader liability for a transaction involving disposal, leading to leakage. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on cleanup cost apportionment. The Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving Shell Oil's liability as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA for a transaction leading to contamination. The questions at hand are whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells a product that later causes contamination, and whether joint and several liability can be imposed on multiple responsible parties under CERCLA. The Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving Shell Oil's liability under CERCLA for a transaction leading to contamination. The case raises questions about imposing liability on a manufacturer who sells a product causing contamination and joint and several liability on multiple responsible parties under CERCLA. The case was argued on February 24, 2009 and is considered one of the most important Superfund cases to reach the Court. The Supreme Court is reviewing a significant Superfund case involving Shell Oil's liability under CERCLA for contamination. The case raises questions about imposing liability on manufacturers for selling products causing contamination and joint and several liability on multiple responsible parties. The heart of the Superfund statute is its expansive liability scheme designed to ensure solvent parties reimburse the government for cleanup costs. Burlington Northern's case before the Court challenges the Superfund statute's joint and several liability provision, potentially impacting the government's ability to recover cleanup costs from responsible parties. The Supreme Court's decision in Burlington Northern's case could affect the government's ability to recover cleanup costs by potentially changing the standard for finding a reasonable basis to apportion liability. This could result in the federal treasury having to cover a larger portion of total cleanup costs more frequently. The Supreme Court's decision in Burlington Northern's case may impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs by changing liability standards. This could lead to the federal treasury covering a larger portion of cleanup costs more often. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products. The Supreme Court's decision in Burlington Northern's case may impact liability standards for cleanup costs, potentially leading to the federal treasury covering more costs. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products, especially in cases where disposal arrangements are not obvious. The Navy sonar case is the most likely to generate headlines, but all accepted cases are important for their individual programs and legal implications. The liability of a manufacturer lies in selling a product, especially when disposal arrangements are not obvious. The five cases accepted by the Supreme Court are important for their individual programs and legal implications, with industry optimistic and the environmental community apprehensive about the outcomes. The direction of the Roberts Court on environmental issues is still emerging, with a split on major cases. The Supreme Court's acceptance of five cases is significant for their legal implications and potential environmental impact. Industry is optimistic while the environmental community is apprehensive, as the appellate court decisions favored the environmental side in all five cases. This suggests a possible reversal of outcomes in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's acceptance of five cases is significant for their legal implications and potential environmental impact. The appellate courts favored the environmental side in all five cases, raising the possibility of outcomes being reversed in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's acceptance of five cases, mostly from the Ninth Circuit, raises the possibility of outcomes being reversed. The Court has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases, showing less tolerance for regulation and more sympathy towards business concerns. The Supreme Court has historically shown less tolerance for regulation and more sympathy towards business concerns in NEPA cases. The large number of environmental cases this term may be due to the conservative justices wanting to resolve as many issues as possible before potential appointments by President Obama. The increase in environmental cases this term may be attributed to various factors such as the Court's certiorari-granting process, conservative justices wanting to address issues before potential appointments by President Obama, and the involvement of eminent Supreme Court practitioners. The Supreme Court is increasingly taking on environmental cases, with eminent practitioners getting involved and increasing the likelihood of case acceptance. Despite this, the Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejects difficult cases related to the Endangered Species Act and the Commerce Clause, including petitions on intrastate applications and the geographic scope of the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, as the majority of certiorari petitions are turned down. The Supreme Court rejects cases related to the Endangered Species Act, the Commerce Clause, and the geographic scope of the Clean Water Act. Speculative reasons for nonacceptance include the justices' continuity from previous decisions, such as in Rapanos v. United States. The Supreme Court rejects cases related to the Endangered Species Act, the Commerce Clause, and the geographic scope of the Clean Water Act. The reason for nonacceptance in cases like Rapanos v. United States is likely due to the continuity of justices from previous decisions, leading to confusion in lower courts."
