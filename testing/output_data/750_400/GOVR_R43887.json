OAA has been reauthorized and amended by Congress multiple times, with the last reauthorization occurring in 2006. OAA Title V funding is provided in the annual DOL appropriations, while Title I does not authorize appropriations.

The transfer to ACL would consolidate Federal oversight of the OAA under one department, streamlining operations. The transfer of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL would consolidate Federal oversight of the OAA under one department, streamlining operations and aligning Federal administration with field operations. Congress would need to pass legislation for the transfer to take effect. If placed in HHS, ACL would target the program to those with the greatest need and consider all sources of income. The FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 President's budget requests proposed transferring CSEOA to ACL, which would target the program to those with the greatest need and consider all sources of income.

A total of $100 million has been provided since 2003 by AOA and CMS to develop ADRC services. Additional funding could help ADRC programs assist states in meeting requirements for an enhanced federal matching rate under Medicaid. The Senate bill would have provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs to improve coordination among ADRCs, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), and Centers for Independent Living (CILs) for consumer access to long-term care services. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs to enhance coordination with AAAs and CILs for consumer access to long-term care services.
