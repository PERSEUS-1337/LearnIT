These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certifications or licensure. Demand for these programs is expected to continue. There is a growing demand for non-degree programs for individuals beyond high school age, such as apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and professional certifications. Jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree are increasing. Demand for workers in jobs not requiring a college degree but needing training or postsecondary education is increasing. Despite over $100 billion in federal financial aid for postsecondary education, most funds are not accessible to those pursuing non-degree programs. Traditional colleges are facing declining enrollment. The federal government provides over $100 billion in financial aid for postsecondary education, but most of it is not accessible to individuals pursuing non-degree programs. Some schools are exploring creative approaches to increase enrollment, including targeting adults for short programs that lead to quick reentry into the workforce or higher earnings. Some traditional colleges are facing declining enrollment, leading to a focus on creative ways to increase student numbers and revenue. One approach is targeting adults for short programs that offer quick reentry into the workforce or higher earnings. There are proposals to provide direct federal support for students pursuing non-degree programs to meet the demand for workers with specific credentials. Several proposals have emerged to increase federal support for students pursuing non-degree programs, including the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) which aims to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and expand support for short-term postsecondary education programs. In 2011-2017, the Department of Education allowed Pell Grants for short-term non-degree programs. The College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs.

Eligibility is determined by a One-Stop operator through an interview or assessment. Under WIOA, individuals must meet specific criteria to receive training services for economic self-sufficiency. Eligibility is determined by a One-Stop operator through an interview or assessment. The operator selects a training service linked to a local occupation, assesses the individual's need for grant assistance, and designates providers for training services. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) designate One-Stop operators to assess and evaluate individuals for training services. Priority is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies in allocating funds for career and training services. The allocation of funds among these groups is determined by the local WDB in consultation with the state's governor. Under WIOA, priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies.

The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) can contract training services for WIOA participants in various work-based learning forms, reimbursing up to 50% of a participant's wage rate, with rates potentially reaching 75% in limited circumstances. States are responsible for developing the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL), and reimbursement for wages is supported by a contract, not an ITA. Administrative structures and procedures vary by state, with quality assurance of training providers ensured through initial and continued eligibility processes. The ETPL is developed by states, with local WDBs and One-Stop operators handling training programs and payments to providers. Administrative structures vary by state, with quality assurance for providers established through eligibility processes. RA programs are automatically eligible for funding, while non-RA providers must apply to the governor and local WDB for approval. Each state establishes criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce areas. RA programs are automatically included on the state ETPL, while non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility. Existing providers must follow procedures to maintain eligibility. Local WDBs have discretion on specific requirements. The WIOA allows local WDBs to determine specific factors for training provider eligibility and OJT contract length. The WIOA allows local WDBs discretion in determining factors for OJT contracts and employer eligibility for training funding without establishing quantifiable targets. ETPs and states are required to report program participation and outcomes. In determining employer eligibility for WIOA incumbent worker training funding, local WDBs consider individual characteristics and training's impact on competitiveness without set targets.

Title IV aid eligibility is determined by statutory rules and cannot exceed a student's cost of attendance (COA), which includes tuition and fees. The eligibility for Title IV aid is determined by statutory rules and cannot exceed a student's cost of attendance (COA), which includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant award rules do not consider other financial assistance a student may receive. The Cost of Attendance (COA) for students includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and dependent care expenses. The Pell Grant award is determined without considering other financial assistance. The maximum Pell Grant award for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time students, which may be reduced based on the student's COA. For AY 2020-2021, the maximum Pell Grant award for full-time students is $6,345, which may be reduced based on various factors. Pell Grant awards used for non-degree programs are subject to income taxation, while those used for degree programs are only taxed if not used for tuition and fees. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type. The amount of financial aid awarded to students may be reduced based on various factors such as cost of attendance, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grant awards used for non-degree programs are subject to income taxation, while those used for degree programs are only taxed if not used for tuition and fees. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type, and other factors can also affect the type and amount of aid awarded. Additionally, other types of financial assistance received by the student must be considered when awarding Direct Loan program loans. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type and other factors, including statutory annual and aggregate award limits based on dependency status and class level. For example, a dependent undergraduate student may borrow up to $5,500 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans for the first year. An individual's eligibility for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans is subject to annual and aggregate award limits based on dependency status and class level. For instance, a dependent undergraduate student can borrow up to $5,500 in these loans for the first year, while an independent undergraduate student can borrow up to $9,500. The maximum loan amount for undergraduates is adjusted for programs shorter than a full academic year. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers these rules. Unsubsidized Loans for first year: Dependent undergraduates can borrow up to $5,500, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $9,500. Maximum loan amount is prorated for shorter programs. FSA administers Title IV aid programs. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers Title IV aid programs, with various actors like FSA and IHEs handling different administrative tasks. FSA manages high-level functions such as system operations, customer service, and program integrity, while IHEs handle day-to-day functions like awarding and disbursing aid to students. ED provides funds to IHEs for award disbursement. IHEs manage day-to-day functions for awarding and disbursing Title IV aid to students, including verifying eligibility, calculating aid amounts, disbursing funds, and managing program funds. ED provides funds to IHEs for award disbursement and pays administrative cost allowances under the Pell Grant program. Several HEA provisions aim to ensure the quality of Title IV-eligible programs. IHEs manage award disbursement and program funds for Title IV aid. ED provides funds and administrative cost allowances under the Pell Grant program. HEA provisions ensure program quality and integrity through state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. The program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensures quality and compliance in Title IV-eligible programs and institutions. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. State authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensure quality and compliance in Title IV programs. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. IHEs must be authorized to provide postsecondary education within their state to participate in Title IV programs. An IHE must be authorized to provide postsecondary education within the state to participate in Title IV programs, complying with state approval and licensure requirements that vary among states. Some states approve IHEs and their programs, while others only require approval of the IHE as a whole. State evaluation of individual programs may also vary. State approval and licensure requirements for postsecondary education vary among states. Some states approve individual educational programs, while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. Evaluation criteria may include program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Programmatic accreditation or approval by another state agency may also be required. State approval and licensure requirements for postsecondary education vary by state. States evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Some states also require programmatic accreditation or approval by another state agency. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED. Accrediting agencies review the quality of education offered. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED as a reliable authority on education quality. Accrediting agencies evaluate institutions based on prescribed criteria, typically regional or national accreditors. These agencies ensure the quality of education offered by the institution. Accrediting agencies evaluate whether an IHE meets criteria set by the agency, including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. The agencies have discretion in the evaluation measures used. Accrediting agencies evaluate IHEs based on faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Agencies have discretion in evaluation measures, with regional and national accreditors assessing overall performance and potentially sampling programs. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but may be sought for employer and licensure requirements. When an IHE seeks Title IV program participation, it must apply for certification from ED, which evaluates the program based on established standards for the field of study. To gain programmatic accreditation, an educational program offered by an IHE is evaluated on established standards for the field of study. When seeking Title IV program participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which reviews each program to determine eligibility based on requirements such as durational and clock-hour criteria for Direct Loan program participation. When seeking Title IV program participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which evaluates if the educational programs meet eligibility requirements, including durational and clock-hour criteria for Direct Loan program participation. New programs can be self-certified as Title IV eligible or submitted for approval to ED. The Direct Loan program requires institutions to have completion and placement rates of at least 70%. Institutions can self-certify new programs as Title IV eligible or submit them for approval to ED. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, although the 2014 regulations defining this term were rescinded in 2019. The 2014 GE regulations defined gainful employment in a recognized occupation as a measure of program quality based on debt-to-earnings rates. The regulations were rescinded in 2019, but the concept was intended to ensure that educational programs lead to earnings that enable students to repay their loans. Each program subject to the GE rules had to meet specific criteria. The GE regulations established debt-to-earnings rates to measure program quality. Programs failing to meet standards may lose Title IV eligibility for three years. No program has lost eligibility yet. Programs must also meet third-party approval standards. Programs subject to GE rules must meet two D/E rates. Failure to meet standards in multiple years results in Title IV ineligibility for three years. No program has lost Title IV eligibility under these requirements yet. Additionally, programs must meet third-party approval standards such as accreditation, state recognition, and professional licensure prerequisites. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires Title IV participating institutions to meet accreditation, state recognition, and professional licensure prerequisites. Institutions must report enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant information to ED. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires Title IV participating institutions to report information on enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant data to ED. Data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs is collected annually, showing the total number of programs and credentials by institutional sector in AY2017-2018. Out of 6,418 Title IV-participating IHEs, 4,618 offered programs. In AY2017-2018, data collected by ED shows that 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating IHEs offered non-degree for-credit programs. Private for-profit IHEs offer half of these programs, while public IHEs award over two-thirds of the credentials. Approximately 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit in AY2015-2016. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Roughly 10% of total recipients and awards were for non-degree programs. 10% of undergraduates with Direct Loans were pursuing certificate programs. Title IV aid is limited to certain programs. In AY2015-2016, Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs and received about $2.7 billion in awards, which accounted for roughly 10% of total recipients and awards. Support for non-degree programs is limited to specific criteria at Title IV-participating institutions. Title IV aid is only available for credit programs at Title IV-participating IHEs, limiting support for work-based learning to programs leading to a certificate or degree. Some students pursuing non-degree programs may be ineligible, such as those without a high school diploma, students with a bachelor's degree for Pell Grants, and students enrolled less than half-time for Direct Loans. Non-degree programs may not be eligible for Title IV aid if students do not have a high school diploma, have a bachelor's degree for Pell Grants, or are enrolled less than half-time for Direct Loans. Program quality for non-degree programs is assessed by state authorizers and accreditors, with flexibility in criteria application. State authorization requirements and program quality have not been extensively studied. State authorizers and accreditors assess non-degree program quality, with flexibility in criteria application. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements, noting variation among states as a complicating factor in assessing institutional experiences. Researchers have identified variation among state authorization requirements as a complicating factor in assessing institutional experiences with program quality. Individual state's history, resources, and priorities may influence the extent to which they take an active or passive role in evaluating non-degree programs. Some potential weaknesses in state authorization requirements include concerns about the oversight of state boards. Researchers have pointed out potential weaknesses in state authorization requirements, such as impaired oversight by state boards due to conflicts of interest or overrepresentation of special interests. Input requirements like faculty qualifications and facilities may hinder innovative education models, leading to elongated timeframes for state authorization. State authorization requirements may be weakened by conflicts of interest, overrepresentation of special interests, and input requirements that impede innovative education models. Elongated timeframes for state authorization may result from a complex regulatory process or lack of state resources, conflicts across state laws, and few states making renewal decisions based on student outcomes. The accreditation system has strengths and weaknesses related to program quality. Institutional accreditors tailor peer reviews based on school type and mission, while programmatic accreditation is aligned with specific fields or programs. The 2014 GAO report identified strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation system. Strengths include tailored peer reviews and alignment with specific fields. Weaknesses include conflicting interests, insufficient resources, inability to assess innovative education modes, and challenges in defining academic quality. Potential weaknesses identified by GAO in the accreditation system include conflicting interests, insufficiency of resources, difficulty in assessing innovative education modes, and challenges in defining academic quality. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, offset some higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, primarily benefiting upper middle-income individuals.

Tax benefits like the Lifetime Learning Credit and Employer Provided Educational Assistance can help reduce income tax liability for individuals pursuing education. 529 accounts are also available for educational savings. The Lifetime Learning Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit for 20% of the first $10,000 in qualifying expenses, which phases out for higher income taxpayers. Employer Provided Educational Assistance excludes eligible educational costs from taxable income. 529 accounts help save for future educational expenses and can be used for non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible IHEs. The Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts can be used for eligible education expenses at Title IV-eligible IHEs, including non-degree programs. Qualified education expenses for the credit include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment. Living expenses and other non-enrollment expenses are not covered. Qualified education expenses for the Lifetime Learning Credit are tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment at a Title IV-eligible IHE. These expenses must be reduced by any tax-free educational assistance used. The course can be part of a post-secondary degree program or for skill improvement. For the Lifetime Learning Credit, qualified education expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment necessary for enrollment at a Title IV-eligible institution. These expenses can be offset by tax-free educational assistance. Courses can be part of a degree program or for skill enhancement, and employer-provided educational assistance can cover various educational expenses. Employer-provided educational assistance can be used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for courses that improve job skills. The payments do not have to be for work-related or degree program courses. For example, an employer can pay up to $5,250 for an employee's skill-improving course, which is not taxable income for the employee. The institution providing the program does not have to be Title IV-eligible. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment. Expenses do not need to be associated with a degree program or a Title IV-eligible institution. Eligibility for training depends on the specific program requirements. The program must be a Title IV-eligible IHE for tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, equipment, and additional expenses for special needs beneficiaries. Eligibility for tax benefits depends on filing a federal income tax return or being claimed as a dependent or spouse. To qualify for tax benefits, participants must file a federal income tax return or be claimed as a dependent or spouse. Taxpayers can claim the credit for education expenses for themselves, spouses, or dependent children.

Employees eligible for 529 plans must receive reasonable notice of the program's terms. States typically sponsor these plans, allowing individuals to open accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from a 529 plan result in a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. Taxpayers must include a portion of the withdrawal if used for non-eligible expenses. When a taxpayer withdraws from a 529 plan, they receive a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis.

Education tax benefits have shown limited effect on increasing enrollment, with limitations such as delayed assistance for upfront education costs. Tax benefits have limited impact on increasing enrollment, especially for non-degree programs. Delays in receiving benefits after expenses are incurred may hinder students who cannot afford upfront education costs. The variety of education benefits available can be confusing for taxpayers to navigate, and only taxpayers with income tax liabilities benefit from these education tax benefits, excluding many low-income individuals. Veterans education programs (GI Bills) were designed to aid former servicemembers in transitioning to civilian life by facilitating their reintegration into the civilian economy. These benefits have evolved over time, but the complexity of different education benefits can be confusing for taxpayers, especially those with limited income tax liabilities. The GI Bills were created to help veterans transition to civilian life by providing education benefits. These benefits have evolved to also address compulsory service, veteran unemployment, equitable benefits for all who served, and military retention. The VET TEC program incentivizes training providers for veteran employment through technology education courses. The GI Bills and VET TEC programs provide financial assistance to students based on military service for approved education and training programs. VET TEC incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment.

Training providers cannot charge tuition to VET TEC participants. Potential participants apply to the VA to ensure eligibility for either the Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC, then enroll in approved programs. Educational institutions certify enrollment and pursuit of eligible individuals. Under VET TEC, veterans cannot be charged tuition directly. They apply to the VA for eligibility, enroll in approved programs, and institutions certify their enrollment. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payments, and distributes them to individuals and educational institutions. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payment amounts, and distributes payments to eligible individuals and educational institutions for GI Bill-approved programs. Program quality is overseen by state approving agencies, with the VA also having oversight responsibilities. VET TEC programs focus on participant employment outcomes, with the VA and SAAs sharing oversight duties. Program quality for GI Bill-approved programs is determined by state approving agencies (SAAs) with oversight from the VA. VET TEC programs focus on participant employment outcomes. The VA contracts with SAAs for approval and ongoing oversight to ensure program quality and proper administration of benefits. The VA contracts with state approving agencies (SAAs) for oversight to ensure program quality and proper administration of GI Bill benefits. Standards are established for education programs, institutions, and training establishments, with a focus on program objectives, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangements. The quality standards for education programs include program objectives, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. These standards aim to address poor quality and abuse in educational institutions. The program objective for independent study programs must be accredited by an ED-recognized agency and lead to a degree or certificate meeting specified criteria. The 85-15 rule limits institutional aid or GI Bill coverage to 85% of students. Contracted courses must be approved for GI Bill purposes.
