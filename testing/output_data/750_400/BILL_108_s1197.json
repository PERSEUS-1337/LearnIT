    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in section 2. Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. These procedures have a significant impact on public health, safety, and interstate commerce, making it crucial to prioritize public health and safety. The administration of medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments in the US has a direct impact on public health and safety. It is important to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that personnel have appropriate education and credentials. Additionally, there is a need for a continuous supply of well-educated individuals in this field. To ensure public health and safety, personnel performing medical imaging and radiation therapy must have appropriate education and credentials. State governments should administer accreditation and certification programs. Competence in these fields should be demonstrated through education. Persons performing medical imaging and radiation therapy must demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience. Both State and Federal Governments are responsible for ensuring public health and safety in these procedures. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy play a role in interstate commerce as patients often travel across state lines for these services. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for services. Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 to set federal standards for these facilities. In 1981, Congress passed the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, setting federal standards for education programs and certification of individuals performing medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 established federal standards for education programs and certification of individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Twenty-two years later, 13 states still do not require licensure for those performing these examinations and treatments. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, 13 states do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy. In 37 states, radiographers are licensed, while radiation therapists are licensed in 28 states, nuclear medicine technologists in 22 states, and medical physicists in 8 states. The Act ensures accreditation of education programs and licensure for individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy. 37 states license radiographers, 28 states license radiation therapists, 22 states license nuclear medicine technologists, 8 states license medical physicists, and no states regulate medical dosimetrists. The Act aims to accredit education programs and license individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure safety and accuracy in patient dose management. No states regulate medical dosimetrists. SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY.
