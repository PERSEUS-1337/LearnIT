    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\". The purpose of the Act is to provide findings and guidelines for the implementation of nanotechnology in schools. Congress finds that nanotechnology is rapidly growing and will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing processes. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the United States. To maximize these benefits, the US must maintain world leadership in nanotechnology. The United States must maintain world leadership in nanotechnology to maximize its benefits, as foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in 2003. According to the National Science Foundation, foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the United States in 2003, with many intending to return to their home countries after completing their studies. Maintaining world leadership in nanotechnology requires a long-term investment in education. In 2003, foreign students earned 55% of engineering doctorates in the US, with many planning to return to their home countries. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating its own students for research and development in the field. The United States needs to invest in educating its students in secondary schools and higher education for nanoscience research and nanotechnology applications. This includes providing access to scientific tools like scanning electron microscopes and training for teachers and professors to use them effectively. The Act aims to enhance the capacity of US schools and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary tools and training.

DEFINITIONS. The Act defines an \"eligible institution\" as a public or charter secondary school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year higher education institution. The Act defines an \"eligible institution\" as a public or charter secondary school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year higher education institution. The terms \"institution of higher education\", \"secondary school\", and \"Secretary\" have specific meanings as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment manufactured in the United States, used for teaching nanotechnology in educational settings. The Education Act of 1965 defines \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50% domestic materials. The Education Act of 1965 defines \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50% domestic materials. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to provide grants up to $150,000 for eligible institutions to acquire equipment and software for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom. An eligible institution can use a grant awarded under the Act to acquire nanotechnology equipment and software for teaching students about nanotechnology and to provide educational services for students or faculty seeking a degree or certificate approved by the State or accrediting body. The grant awarded under the Act can be used by eligible institutions to acquire nanotechnology equipment and software for teaching students about nanotechnology, providing educational services for students or faculty seeking approved degrees or certificates, and offering teacher education and certification for individuals looking to enhance technology skills for using nanotechnology in the classroom. The grant awarded under the Act can be used by eligible institutions to provide teacher education and certification for individuals seeking to enhance technology skills for using nanotechnology in the classroom. Not more than 1/4 of the funds can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education and certification. The grant awarded under the Act can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education and certification, with a limitation of not more than 1/4 of the funds. Funds from the grant awarded to community colleges or higher education institutions can only be used in undergraduate programs. The grant awarded under the Act can only be used in undergraduate programs at community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director to receive the grant. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director within 180 days of the Act's enactment to receive grants. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications and announce it in the Federal Register. The selection process for grant recipients will prioritize encouraging eligible institutions to apply. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications and announce it in the Federal Register. Selection of eligible institutions for grants will prioritize geographic diversity and historically Black colleges and universities. The Director will prioritize geographic diversity and historically Black colleges and universities when selecting eligible institutions for grants. The Director prioritizes geographic diversity and historically Black colleges and universities when selecting eligible institutions for grants, including those in states participating in the EPSCoR program. Grants cannot be awarded unless institutions meet the requirements outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) requires eligible institutions to agree to provide non-Federal matching funds for the program costs. The EPSCoR program requires eligible institutions to provide non-Federal matching funds for program costs, with a waiver available for institutions with low endowment values. The EPSCoR program mandates institutions to match a quarter of the grant amount, with a waiver for those with low endowment values. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 cannot reapply for 2 years. If a branch or institution receives a grant over $100,000 under this Act, they are not eligible for another grant for 2 years. If an eligible institution other than a branch receives a grant exceeding $100,000 under this Act, they cannot receive another grant for 2 years. Annual report and evaluation are required as per Section 5 of the Act. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on fund usage within a year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year based on the activities of the grant-receiving institutions. The Director evaluates the program every third year based on reports from grant-receiving institutions. The evaluation assesses the impact of activities on students, faculty, and staff. After the evaluation, a report is submitted to Congress within 6 months. The Director evaluates the impact of activities on students, faculty, and staff receiving grants under this Act. A report is submitted to Congress within 6 months with recommendations on the need for Federal support. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
