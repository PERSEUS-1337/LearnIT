It differs from Random Features by building a kernel from a random feature map specified by the distance measure. Random objects are used to produce a random feature embedding for each instance. The D2KE methodology proposes using a finite number of random objects to create a kernel from a random feature map specified by the distance measure. It offers better generalizability than universal Nearest-Neighbor estimates and relates to the representative-set method and distance substitution kernel. The D2KE methodology provides a theoretical analysis showing better generalizability than universal Nearest-Neighbor estimates. It subsumes the representative-set method and generalizes Random Features methods to complex structured inputs. Our proposed framework excels in classification experiments across various domains like time series, strings, and histograms for texts and images, outperforming existing distance-based learning methods in testing accuracy and computational time. It is often easier to define a dissimilarity function between instances than to create a feature representation, especially with structured inputs like real-valued time series, strings, histograms, and graphs. Constructing feature representations for structured inputs like time series, strings, histograms, and graphs can be challenging due to varying sizes. Dissimilarity measures such as Dynamic Time Warping for time series and Edit Distance for strings offer well-developed alternatives. Standard machine learning methods are not well-suited for structured inputs with varying sizes. Distance-based methods like Nearest-Neighbor Estimation are commonly used for prediction on such inputs. The Wasserstein distance is commonly used for distributions, but traditional machine learning methods are more focused on vector representations. Nearest-Neighbor Estimation (NNE) is a distance-based method for prediction on structured inputs, but it can be unreliable with high variance when neighbors are far apart due to large intrinsic dimensions implied by the distance.

Research has focused on developing global distance-based machine learning methods using similarity functions and kernel-based approaches like Support Vector Machines or kernel ridge regression. However, most similarity measures do not provide a positive-definite kernel, leading to non-convex optimization problems. Some work has focused on estimating a positive-definite Gram matrix that approximates the similarity matrix. Some methods aim to estimate a positive-definite Gram matrix that approximates the similarity matrix, but modifications to achieve this can lead to a loss of information and inconsistency between training data. Some methods modify the similarity matrix to enforce positive-definiteness, but this can lead to information loss and inconsistency between training and testing data. Another approach involves selecting a subset of training samples as a representative set for feature functions. In this paper, a novel general framework is proposed to construct a family of positive-definite kernels from dissimilarity data. This approach aims to address issues such as inconsistency between training and testing samples and outperforms representative-set methods in various application domains. The proposed framework, D2KE, constructs a family of PD kernels from a dissimilarity measure on structured inputs. It draws from the literature of Random Features but builds novel kernels specifically designed for a given distance measure.

We generalize Random Features methods to complex structured inputs of variable sizes, outperforming existing distance-based learning methods. This framework accelerates kernel machines on structured inputs like time-series, strings, and histograms using a generic RF method. This is the first time a generic RF method has been used to accelerate kernel machines on structured inputs like time-series, strings, and histograms. Existing approaches for distance-based kernel learning have limitations on the distance function or construct empirical PD Gram matrices that may not generalize to test samples. Conditions provided by BID22 and BID42 for obtaining a PD kernel through simple transformations of the distance measure are not satisfied for many commonly used dissimilarity sizes. The distance can be isometric to the square of the Euclidean distance. BID22 and BID42 provide conditions for obtaining a PD kernel through simple transformations of the distance measure, not satisfied for commonly used dissimilarity measures like Dynamic Time Warping, Hausdorff distance, and Earth Mover's distance. A generalization error bound was provided for the similarity-as-kernel approach in BID7, but only for a positive-definite similarity function. The dissimilarity measures like Dynamic Time Warping, Hausdorff distance, and Earth Mover's distance are not satisfied. Different approaches include finding a Euclidean embedding or using an SVM solver in Krein spaces. The dissimilarity matrix can be approximated through embedding techniques like Multidimensional Scaling. Specific approaches focus on building a positive definite kernel for structured inputs such as text and time-series data. These kernels can lead to diagonal-dominance issues. Approaches aim to construct a positive definite kernel for structured inputs like text and time-series data. These kernels can suffer from diagonal-dominance issues due to the large number of alignments considered. Interest in approximating non-linear kernel machines using randomized feature maps has grown to reduce training and testing times for kernel-based learning. Interest in approximating non-linear kernel machines using randomized feature maps has surged in recent years due to a significant reduction in training and testing times for kernel-based learning algorithms. Various explicit nonlinear random feature maps have been constructed for different types of kernels, including Gaussian, Laplacian, intersection, additive, dot product, and semigroup kernels. Among them, Random Fourier Features stand out. Random Fourier Features (RFF) method approximates Gaussian Kernel function by multiplying input with a Gaussian random matrix. Fruitful variants of RFF have been extensively studied both theoretically and empirically. Various methods have been proposed to accelerate RFF on high-dimensional input data matrices. The Random Fourier Features (RFF) method approximates a Gaussian Kernel function by multiplying input with a Gaussian random matrix. Various methods have been proposed to accelerate RFF on high-dimensional input data matrices, leveraging structured matrices for faster computation and less memory consumption. However, existing RF methods only consider inputs with vector representations and compute the RF through linear transformations. D2KE differs from existing Random Fourier Features (RFF) methods by considering structured inputs of different sizes and computing the Random Features (RF) with a structured distance metric. Existing RFF methods only handle inputs with vector representations and compute the RF through linear transformations. D2KE differs from existing Random Fourier Features (RFF) methods by using structured inputs of different sizes and computing RF with a structured distance metric. It constructs a new PD kernel through a random feature map, making it computationally feasible via RF. The differences between D2KE and existing RF methods are listed in Table 1. D2KE constructs a new PD kernel through a random feature map, making it computationally feasible via RF. A recent work BID49 developed a kernel and algorithm for single-variable time-series, but it cannot be applied to structured inputs like strings, histograms, and graphs. In contrast, our unified framework handles various structured inputs and provides a theoretical analysis on KNN and distance-based kernel methods. Our unified framework extends beyond the limitations of BID49 by accommodating various structured inputs such as strings, histograms, and graphs. It offers a general theoretical analysis on KNN and other distance-based kernel methods for estimating a target function from a collection of samples. The text discusses the estimation of a target function using distance-based kernel methods with structured input objects and output observations. It mentions the use of dissimilarity measures instead of feature representations and highlights the equivalence between similarity and Euclidean matrices. The text discusses using dissimilarity measures for structured input objects in learning tasks, emphasizing the equivalence between similarity and Euclidean matrices. It mentions the importance of a metric dissimilarity measure and an ideal feature representation that is compact and results in a simple target function. The text discusses the importance of dissimilarity measures for structured input objects in learning tasks, emphasizing the need for a metric dissimilarity measure and an ideal feature representation that simplifies the target function. The text emphasizes the importance of dissimilarity measures and feature representations in learning tasks, aiming for a compact space with small intrinsic dimension. Lipschitz Continuity is preferred for the target function to have a small constant with respect to the dissimilarity measure. The text discusses the importance of Lipschitz Continuity for the target function to have a small constant with respect to the dissimilarity measure, emphasizing the need for a quantity that measures the size of the space implied by a given dissimilarity measure. The text discusses the importance of Lipschitz Continuity for the target function and introduces the concept of covering number to measure the size of the space implied by a dissimilarity measure. It explores how these quantities affect the estimation error of a Nearest-Neighbor Estimator in structured input spaces. The text introduces the concept of effective dimension in structured input spaces X with a distance measure d, and a finite covering number N(\u03b4; X, d). It provides an example of effective dimension in the case of measuring the space of Multiset, which allows duplicate elements. The effective dimension in structured input spaces X with distance measure d is defined as the minimum p satisfying a certain condition. An example is provided for measuring the space of Multiset, which allows duplicate elements. The (modified) Hausdorff Distance measures the distance between elements in a set. The covering number of a set under a ground distance is denoted by N(\u03b4; V, \u2206). By constructing a covering of sets of size bounded by L, we can obtain a bound on the estimation error of the k-Nearest-Neighbor estimate of a target function. The concept of effective dimension allows us to bound the estimation error of the k-Nearest-Neighbor estimate of a target function. The proof is similar to standard analysis of k-NN's estimation error, with the covering number replacing the space partition number. The estimation error of the k-Nearest-Neighbor estimate decreases slowly with the number of samples when the dimension is large. To bound the error, the number of samples must scale exponentially with the dimension. An estimator based on a RKHS derived from the effective dimension is developed. In the following sections, an estimator based on a RKHS derived from the effective dimension is introduced to address the problem of converting a distance measure into a positive definite kernel. A simple and effective approach called D2KE is presented to construct a family of positive definite kernels from a given distance measure. An estimator is developed based on a RKHS derived from a distance measure, with improved sample complexity for higher effective dimension problems. A simple approach called D2KE constructs positive-definite kernels from a given distance measure by introducing a family of kernels based on a random structured object \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126. The text discusses constructing a family of positive-definite kernels from a given distance measure using a random structured object \u03c9. The kernels are parameterized by p(\u03c9) and \u03b3, with a relationship to the Distance Substitution Kernel. The kernel can be interpreted using a soft minimum function defined by p(\u03c9) and \u03b3. The kernel in Equation (4) is derived from the distance of x to random objects \u03c9 in \u2126, parameterized by p(\u03c9) and \u03b3. It can be interpreted as a soft version of the distance substitution kernel BID22, where a soft minimum function is used instead of substituting d(x, y) into the exponent. The kernel k(x, y) is a soft version of the distance substitution kernel, defined by p(\u03c9) and \u03b3. When \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, the value is determined by min \u03c9 \u2208\u2126 d(x, \u03c9) + d(\u03c9, y), which equals d(x, y) if X \u2286 \u2126. Unlike the distance-substitution kernel, our kernel is always PD by construction. The kernel in Equation FORMULA13 is always positive definite by construction. To evaluate it, draw samples from p(\u03c9) and solve for a R-dimensional feature embedding. The kernel cannot be evaluated analytically in general but can be approximated via Random Features. The kernel in Equation FORMULA13 is positive definite by construction and can be approximated via Random Features for evaluation. This allows for the use of the kernel in large-scale settings with a large number of samples efficiently. The kernel in Equation FORMULA13 can be approximated via Random Features for efficient use in large-scale settings with a large number of samples. The RF approximation allows for learning a target function as a linear function of the RF feature map by minimizing domain-specific empirical risk. Recent work (BID45) focuses on selecting random features through optimization in a supervised setting. The RF approximation allows for learning a target function as a linear function of the RF feature map by minimizing domain-specific empirical risk. Recent work (BID45) focuses on selecting random features through optimization in a supervised setting, which is orthogonal to the D2KE approach outlined in Algorithm 1 for our class of D2KE kernels. The RF based empirical risk minimization approach outlined in Algorithm 1 involves computing random feature embeddings using a structured distance measure and exponent function parameterized by \u03b3, different from traditional RF methods. The RF based empirical risk minimization approach involves computing random feature embeddings using a structured distance measure and exponent function parameterized by \u03b3. This contrasts with traditional RF methods that use a matrix multiplication with random Gaussian matrix followed by a non-linearity. The estimator is analyzed in Algorithm 1 in Section 5, comparing its statistical performance to K-nearest-neighbor. The relationship to the representative-set method is discussed, showing a kernel Equation (4) dependent on the data distribution. The estimator in Algorithm 1 in Section 5 is analyzed and compared to K-nearest-neighbor. The relationship to the representative-set method is discussed, showing a kernel Equation (4) dependent on the data distribution. A Random-Feature approximation to the kernel is obtained by creating an R-dimensional feature embedding. The Random-Feature approximation to the kernel in Equation (4) is obtained by creating an R-dimensional feature embedding using a part of the training data as samples from p(\u03c9). This method provides a generalization error bound even as R approaches infinity. By interpreting Equation (8) as a random-feature approximation to the kernel in Equation (4), a nicer generalization error bound is obtained even as R approaches infinity. The choice of p(\u03c9) is crucial in the kernel, with many \"close to uniform\" choices yielding good results across various domains. In contrast to previous methods, the choice of p(\u03c9) in the kernel plays a crucial role in obtaining a better generalization error bound even as R approaches infinity. Surprisingly, \"close to uniform\" choices of p(\u03c9) have shown better performance in various domains compared to traditional data distribution choices. In various domains, the choice of p(\u03c9) plays a crucial role in performance. For example, in time-series with DTW, a distribution of random time series yields better results than the Representative-Set Method. Similarly, in string classification with edit distance, a distribution of random strings performs better than RSM. The choice of distribution p(\u03c9) is crucial for performance in different domains. For instance, in time series with DTW, a random time series outperforms the Representative-Set Method. Similarly, in string classification with edit distance, random strings perform better than RSM. In vector classification with the Hausdorff distance, random sets of vectors yield significantly better results than RSM. The reasons for the improved performance of these distributions are still under conjecture. When classifying sets of vectors with the Hausdorff distance, a distribution p(\u03c9) of random sets of size uniform in [3, 15] from a unit sphere performs better than RSM. The synthetic nature of p(\u03c9) allows for an unlimited number of random features, resulting in a better approximation to the exact kernel. This is in contrast to RSM, which requires limited held-out samples from the data. The synthetic nature of p(\u03c9) allows for generating unlimited random features, providing a better approximation to the exact kernel compared to RSM. Even with a small number of random features, p(\u03c9) can outperform RSM, capturing more relevant semantic information for estimating f(x). In this section, the proposed framework is analyzed from the perspective of error decomposition in the RKHS corresponding to the kernel. The population risk minimizer subject to the RKHS norm constraint and the corresponding empirical risk are discussed.

The population risk minimizer subject to the RKHS norm constraint and the corresponding empirical risk are discussed. The estimated function from the random feature approximation is denoted as f R, with population and empirical risks denoted as L( f ) and L( f ) respectively. The risk decomposition is discussed in terms of three terms from rightmost to leftmost. The text discusses the risk decomposition in the RKHS corresponding to the kernel. The estimated function from the random feature approximation is denoted as f R, with population and empirical risks denoted as L( f ) and L( f ) respectively. The function approximation error is analyzed in terms of the RKHS implied by the kernel, which is a smaller function space than the space of Lipschitz-continuous functions. The RKHS implied by the kernel in Equation FORMULA12 is a smaller function space than the space of Lipschitz-continuous functions. Any function in the RKHS is Lipschitz-continuous w.r.t. the given distance. Additional smoothness can be imposed via the RKHS norm constraint and the kernel parameter. The goal is for the best function within this class to approximate the true function well in terms of the approximation error. The RKHS, defined by the kernel in Equation FORMULA12, is a smaller function space compared to Lipschitz-continuous functions. Additional smoothness is imposed through the RKHS norm constraint and kernel parameter to improve approximation error. The estimation error is quantified using eigenvalues of the kernel and a tuning parameter \u03bb, ensuring a probabilistic bound on the difference between the true function and the best approximating function within the RKHS class. The RKHS provides a better estimation error compared to Lipschitz-continuous functions. The estimation error is quantified using eigenvalues of the kernel and a tuning parameter \u03bb, ensuring a probabilistic bound on the difference between the true function and the best approximating function within the RKHS class. The estimation error has a much better dependency with respect to n. The estimation error for a RKHS estimator has a better dependency on n (i.e. n^-1/2) compared to k-nearest-neighbor method, especially for higher effective dimension. Tighter bounds on estimation error and better rates with respect to n may be possible with further analysis. However, analyzing the estimation error for the specific kernel used is challenging. Random Feature Approximation is discussed in the curr_chunk, focusing on the empirical risk function DenoteL(.). The error from RF approximation can be bounded using estimation error bounds, with a focus on the RKHS norm bounded by C for both f R and f n. The curr_chunk discusses the approximation error of the kernel in Random Feature Approximation, with a focus on uniform convergence and effective dimension. The analysis aims to guarantee a specific probability bound for the error. The curr_chunk focuses on the approximation error of the kernel in Random Feature Approximation, emphasizing uniform convergence and effective dimension to ensure a specific probability bound for the error. The analysis also considers the optimal solution of empirical risk minimization using the Representer theorem. The curr_chunk discusses the approximation error in Random Feature Approximation and provides a bound on the empirical risk. It introduces Proposition 2 and Corollary 1, stating conditions for guaranteeing a specific error bound with probability 1 - \u03b4. The analysis involves the Lipschitz-continuous constant of the loss function and a bound on \u03b1 1/n. The corollary states that to guarantee a specific error bound with probability 1 - \u03b4 in Random Feature Approximation, it is sufficient to have a number of Random Features proportional to the effective dimension O(p X,d / 2). This framework can achieve suboptimal performance according to Claim 1. Claim 1 in the proposed framework shows that the estimated function from random feature approximation can achieve suboptimal performance when compared to the desired target function.

Results show that D2KE outperforms other baselines on all datasets, with distance based kernel methods performing better than KNN. D2KE also excels due to its random short length documents fitting well for document classification tasks. Based kernel methods, particularly SVM, outperform KNN on text data. D2KE also significantly outperforms other baselines, especially for document classification tasks. It achieves a speedup compared to other methods due to the use of random features. For image data, the modified Hausdorff distance is used as the distance measure between images. D2KE achieves a significant speedup compared to other methods for datasets with a large number of documents and longer document lengths, thanks to the use of random features. For image data, the modified Hausdorff distance is used as the distance measure between images, showing excellent performance in the literature. The modified Hausdorff distance is used as the distance measure between images, with D2KE outperforming other baselines in all cases. Random images of SIFT-descriptors are generated and parameters for \u03b3 and sequence length are optimized. D2KE performs best in three cases, while DSK_RBF is the best on dataset decor. Results show that D2KE outperforms other baselines in all cases, with the best performance in three instances. However, the quadratic complexity of some methods makes scaling to large datasets challenging. The quadratic complexity of DSK_RBF, DSK_ND, and KSVM makes scaling to large datasets difficult. D2KE still outperforms KNN and RSM, showing it can be a strong alternative across applications."
