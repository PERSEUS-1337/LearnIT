To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing the goals of generalization and robustness. Noise can improve neural networks training by enhancing generalization and robustness. Introducing variability through noise at input or supervision levels can lead to significant improvements in model performance. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" demonstrate how noise can enhance generalization and robustness in models. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also surprisingly improves model robustness. This study emphasizes the benefits of incorporating noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area.

The design of Deep Neural Networks for efficient real-world deployment involves considering key elements such as memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. DNNs are often deployed in resource-constrained devices or applications with strict latency requirements, necessitating the development of compact models that generalize well. It is crucial to evaluate the models' performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data due to the constantly changing deployment environments. In resource-constrained environments like self-driving cars, compact models that generalize well are essential. Performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data must be considered for reliability. Robustness against malicious attacks is also crucial. Various techniques like model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation are used to achieve high performance in compressed models.

Knowledge Distillation involves training a smaller network (student) under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network (teacher) to mimic the teacher model's output. Knowledge distillation is an interactive learning method where a smaller network (student) is trained under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network (teacher). The goal is to mimic the teacher model's output, improving the student model's performance. Despite promising results, there is still a performance gap between the student and teacher models. The teacher model's softened softmax output consistently improves the student model's performance, but a significant gap remains. Capturing knowledge from the larger network and transferring it to a smaller model is still an open question. Improving the student model's robustness in real-world deployment is crucial.
