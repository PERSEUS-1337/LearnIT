    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose to rescind funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush, who had item veto authority as Governor of Texas, has advocated for similar power for the President. President George W. Bush, with prior item veto authority as Governor of Texas, has pushed for similar power for the President. In 2006, he proposed the Legislative Line Item Veto Act to address excessive earmark projects. President George W. Bush proposed the Legislative Line Item Veto Act in 2006 to address excessive earmark projects. The Act required at least one house of Congress to vote on presidential rescission proposals, with approval from both houses needed to make the rescission permanent. \"Expedited rescission requires one house of Congress to vote on presidential rescission proposals. Approval from both houses is necessary to make the rescission permanent. Enhanced rescission, under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President by canceling spending reductions unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill.\" The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 altered the rescission framework to favor the President, making spending reductions identified in special presidential messages permanently cancelled unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill. If the President vetoes the disapproval bill, a two-thirds majority in both chambers is needed to override the veto. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate approval of the President's rescission request. Expedited rescission bills aim to streamline the process for approving the President's spending cuts by implementing fast-track procedures in Congress. Congressional approval is still required, but the expedited approach encourages a prompt up-or-down vote on the President's proposal. This method has gained support for its efficiency in transferring spending authority. Expedited rescission bills streamline the process for approving the President's spending cuts with fast-track procedures in Congress. Congressional approval is still necessary, but the approach encourages a prompt up-or-down vote on the President's proposal, transferring spending authority efficiently. The expedited rescission bill passed by the House in 1992 aimed to transfer less power from Congress to the President. It allowed the President to propose spending cuts within three days of signing an appropriations act, with restrictions on the extent of reductions. The bill included fast-track procedures for a prompt floor vote within 10 days, without allowing amendments. The House bill in 1993, H.R. 1578, allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding, with expedited judicial review provisions. In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 1578 allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding with expedited judicial review provisions. H.R. 1578 also included fast-track procedures for expedited consideration of a rescission's substitute. H.R. 4600, approved by the House in 1994, allowed submission of a special rescission message at any time and required a separate message for each appropriations subcommittee. The House approved H.R. 4600 in 1994, allowing submission of a special rescission message at any time and requiring separate messages for each appropriations subcommittee. The bill also authorized the President to propose repealing targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. H.R. 4600 authorized special messages from the President proposing the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. A draft expedited rescission bill, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, was introduced in 2006. The proposed Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 aimed to give the President authority to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority in appropriations acts. The Administration bill proposed to amend the ICA by inserting a new \"Part C -- Legislative Line Item Veto,\" granting the President authority to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The LLIVA would provide flexibility in submission and packaging of the special messages without time constraints. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act (LLIVA) grants the President flexibility to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending items in special messages to Congress. There are no time constraints, and multiple rescissions can be included in a single message. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction. The LLIVA allows the President to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending items in special messages to Congress. There are no time constraints, and multiple rescissions can be included in a single message. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction, and adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps must be made within five days of enactment. The rescission approval bill would require adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures, with a five-day deadline for committees to report the bill without substantive revision. The President's proposed bill could be introduced by the House and Senate leadership within two days of receiving a special message. The committee would have five days to report the bill without substantive revision, and a vote on final passage would have to occur by the 10th day of session following introduction. Debate would be limited to four hours in the House. The President's proposed bill could be introduced by the House and Senate leadership within two days of receiving a special message. The committee would have five days to report the bill without substantive revision, and with or without recommendation; if the reporting deadline were not met, the committee would be automatically discharged from consideration of the bill and the bill would be placed on the calendar. A vote on final passage would have to occur by the 10th day of session following introduction of the approval bill. Debate would be limited to four hours in the House and 10 hours in the Senate. No amendments to the approval bill would be in order in either chamber. Additional expedited procedural rules are detailed for consideration of the approval bill. The LLIVA as introduced would allow the President to withhold any budget authority proposed for rescission for up to 180 days following transmittal of the special. The LLIVA introduced would allow the President to withhold budget authority proposed for rescission for up to 180 days following transmittal of a special message. The President could also suspend the execution of any item of direct spending for 180 days, with the option to release the funds before the 180-day period expires. The LLIVA introduced would allow the President to withhold budget authority proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for up to 180 days following a special message. This provision is unique in expedited rescission bills and aims to provide temporary withholding until Congress can review the President's request. The LLIVA introduced would allow the President to withhold budget authority proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for up to 180 days. Supporters argue it provides a temporary mechanism for Congress to consider a President's request, while others see it as unnecessary due to expedited procedures usually ensuring a final vote within a month. Critics argue that the 180-day withholding mechanism in LLIVA could be abused and is unnecessary, as expedited procedures typically lead to a final vote on the President's request within a month. They suggest a shorter period for Congress to act on a special message would suffice, and express concerns about the potential for multiple 180-day withholding periods. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism in LLIVA argue for a shorter period for Congress to act on a special message, expressing concerns about potential abuse and unnecessary delays. Supporters stress that the 180-day provision is the maximum period for funding withholding. The LLIVA allows for the return of policy deferrals with a one-house veto, invalidated by court decisions. Supporters emphasize the 180-day maximum deferral period, with the President able to release funds earlier if deemed necessary. The bill does not mandate early release even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The LLIVA allows for a 180-day maximum deferral period for funding, with the President having the authority to release funds earlier if necessary. The language in the bill does not require early release even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The provisions of the LLIVA are severable for judicial review, meaning that if a portion is found unconstitutional, the rest remains in force. The act becomes effective upon signing and applies only to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. The LLIVA allows for a 180-day deferral period for funding, with the President able to release funds earlier if needed. Its provisions are severable for judicial review, meaning unconstitutional parts won't affect the rest. The act becomes effective upon signing and applies only to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress. Several measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including the LLIVA (H.R. 4890 / S. 2381) and an omnibus budget reform measure (H.R. 2290) proposed by Representative Jeb Hensarling. These provisions would allow the President to propose rescinding wasteful budget authority in appropriations acts and reduce discretionary spending limits for new budgets. The provisions in H.R. 2290 allow the President to propose rescinding wasteful budget authority in appropriations acts and reduce discretionary spending limits for new budgets. The President is limited to one message for each appropriations act under this bill. The H.R. 2290 bill allows the President to propose rescinding wasteful budget authority and reduce discretionary spending limits. Representative Mark Udall introduced three expedited rescission measures in the 109th Congress. Representative Mark Udall introduced the H.R. 4699 bill, known as the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act (or SLICE Act) of 2006,\" in the 109th Congress. This bill aims to enable the President to propose spending reductions that Congress must debate and vote on. The H.R. 4699 bill, also known as the SLICE Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Mark Udall in the 109th Congress, allows the President to propose spending cuts that Congress must debate and vote on.

Senator John Kerry introduced a similar bill, S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006. The draft bill introduced by Senator John Kerry, S. 2372, is similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996.

Table 1 provides a comparative overview of major features in three expedited rescission bills. The expedited rescission bills, including H.R. 4890 / S. 2381, have notable differences in versions approved by the House and Senate Budget Committee. Changes were made to limit the President's flexibility, such as adding a deadline for special submission. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, overturned by the Supreme Court in 1998, is also referenced. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-130) was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1998. Noteworthy differences exist among the versions of the expedited rescission bills, with changes made to limit the President's flexibility. For example, the House-passed version of H.R. 4890 requires special messages to be submitted within 45 calendar days of enactment, while S. 3521 allows submission of a special message up to a certain point. The House-passed version of H.R 4890 requires special messages to be submitted within 45 calendar days of enactment, while S. 3521 allows submission of a special message up to one year following enactment. The House version sets a limit of five special messages per act, or 10 for omnibus measures, while the Senate version limits the President to four special messages per calendar year. The Senate bill allows special messages to be submitted up to one year following enactment, with a limit of four special messages per calendar year. The House-passed version is more permissive in the total number of special messages allowed, while the Senate bill is more lenient in the timing of their submissions. The House version allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 calendar days after submitting a special message. The House version is more permissive in the total number of special messages allowed, while the Senate bill is more lenient in the timing of their submissions. The LLIVA would allow the President to withhold funds for up to 180 calendar days, while S. 3521 limits withholding to 45 calendar days. The House-passed version allows a 45-day extension for a total withholding period of up to 90 days. The LLIVA has no sunset termination date, unlike the House-passed version. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President to withhold funds for up to 90 days, with a 45-day extension possible. The LLIVA has no sunset termination date, while S. 3521 limits withholding to 45 days and stipulates termination after four years. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President to withhold funds for up to 90 days, with a 45-day extension possible. The LLIVA has no sunset termination date, while S. 3521 limits withholding to 45 days and stipulates termination after four years. Both versions narrow the range of possible targeted tax benefits for cancellation compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, along with provisions in P.L. 104-130, would cover revenue-losing measures affecting 100 or fewer beneficiaries. The House-passed version targets provisions affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require certain actions regarding targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, along with provisions in P.L. 104-130, would cover revenue-losing measures affecting a single beneficiary or a limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require the identification of targeted tax benefits by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The President could propose a rescission of such identified tax benefits. H.R. 4890/S. 2381 would allow the President to propose any targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 requires identification of targeted tax benefits by the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees.

The bill also amends Title X of the ICA by removing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The current bills are debating whether the expedited rescission framework would enhance or replace the President's rescission authority. Section 1016 of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 would amend Title X of the ICA by replacing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The debate revolves around whether the expedited rescission framework in the bills would enhance or replace the President's rescission authority under the ICA. No significant changes were made to H.R. 4890 during floor consideration, but a manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan was adopted. The President has the authority under the ICA to propose rescissions at any time, with funds released after 45 legislative days without congressional approval. A manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan was added to H.R. 4890, clarifying that cancelled amounts from trust funds or special funds would be returned to the original fund. The amendment in response to concerns from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee clarified that cancelled amounts from trust funds or special funds would be returned to the original fund.

Changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups, while a manager's amendment in S. 3521 made changes to Title I, including the legislative line item veto and deficit reduction. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act due to adjournment. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act due to adjournment. The amendment also proposes to reduce the period during which the President may suspend new direct spending or targeted tax benefits if the cancellation proposal is submitted after the effective date of the provisions. The bill includes provisions for expedited consideration of special messages from the President proposing rescissions of funds, aiming for a vote within 10 days of introduction in the chamber. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure prompt approval. Expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress aim to ensure a vote on the approval bill within 10 days of introduction, differing in scope from earlier bills in the 1990s. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills aim to allow a vote on the approval bill within 10 days, with variations in coverage over the years. H.R. 4699 proposes adding certain transportation projects to the list of items eligible for rescission. Expedited rescission bills have evolved in scope over the years, with earlier bills focusing on discretionary budget authority. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4699 proposed including certain transportation projects for possible cancellations. The Line Item Veto Act in all versions considered would grant the President broad authority to rescind discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. The LLIVA in all three versions considered here would grant the President expansive authority for rescission of discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had potential constitutional flaws and provisions for expedited judicial review, while the expedited rescission approach is generally viewed as acceptable for discretionary spending items. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had constitutional flaws and provisions for expedited judicial review. The expedited rescission approach is generally viewed as acceptable for discretionary spending items. The LLIVA includes a severability provision for statutory insulation in case of unconstitutional findings. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had constitutional flaws and provisions for expedited judicial review. The LLIVA includes a severability provision for statutory insulation in case of unconstitutional findings, allowing the President to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration. If one provision is found unconstitutional, the rest of the act would not be affected. This could potentially allow the President to continue using expedited rescission for discretionary budget authority or direct spending items. The President seeks expedited consideration for special rescission messages to target pork in the budget, urging the Senate to pass the line item veto legislation. The Bush Administration continues to push for enactment of the Line Item Veto Act in the 109th Congress. The President urged the Senate to pass the line item veto legislation to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline. He called for expedited consideration to sign it into law."
