    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322 by President George Bush. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the conference agreement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (H.R. 2673). H.R. 2989 provided a 4.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, which was incorporated into H.R. 2673 as the first session of the 108th Congress was ending. In FY2004, H.R. 2673 provided a 4.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. H.R. 2989 was incorporated into H.R. 2673, which was signed into law as P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004, with an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. H.R. 2989 was included in H.R. 2673, which became P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The law provided an extra 2.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. President Bush signed the bill into law, and an additional pay adjustment was issued through Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004. The President issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, allocated as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments and net annual and locality pay increases. Federal white-collar employees receive an annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payment under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 provides federal white-collar employees with an annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payment. The pay adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures. FEPCA has not been fully implemented as originally enacted, with some years experiencing reduced pay adjustments. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 provides federal white-collar employees with annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments. The adjustments are not tied to the cost of living and have seen reduced amounts in certain years. In January 2003, employees received a combined 4.1% pay increase. In 1995, 1996, and 1998, reduced annual adjustment amounts were provided for federal white-collar employees. From 1995 to 2004, reduced locality payments were also given. In January 2003, employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. In 2004, they received the same adjustment. If specified by FEPCA, the net pay increase in January 2003 would have been 18.56%, and in January 2004, it would have been 15.15%. In 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. The nationwide average net pay increase in January 2004 would have been 15.15% if specified by FEPCA. This report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under the General Schedule, Foreign Service Schedule, and Veterans Health Administration Schedule. It does not cover salary adjustments for federal officials, federal judges, or Members of Congress. The report discusses the annual pay adjustment for federal employees under various schedules, excluding federal officials, judges, and Members of Congress. Administrative law judges, senior-level, and scientific/professional positions may also receive salary adjustments at the discretion of agency heads. The annual pay adjustment for federal employees is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and may be adjusted for administrative law judges, senior-level, and scientific/professional positions at the discretion of agency heads. Contract appeals board members' adjustments depend on Executive Schedule pay adjustments. The annual pay adjustment for federal employees is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with basic pay rates increasing by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI change. The ECI indicated a 2.7% pay adjustment in January 2004, reflecting a 3.2% change in private sector wages and salaries. The adjustment is effective at the start of the first pay period after January 1. FEPCA allows for an alternative pay adjustment plan to be issued by the President in case of national emergency or serious economic conditions. This plan must be submitted to Congress before September 1 preceding the effective date. FEPCA allows the President to issue an alternative pay adjustment plan in case of national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued a 1.5% annual pay adjustment plan in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments. President Bush issued a 1.5% annual pay adjustment plan in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, and certain non-General Schedule employees may also receive a locality pay adjustment in 2004. In 2004, certain non-General Schedule employees, including those in the Foreign Service and senior-level positions, may receive locality pay adjustments. The Pay Agent determines pay cap levels for these employees. OPM clarified limitations for non-General Schedule employees in December 2001. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive prevailing rate adjustments capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. In December 2001, OPM clarified limitations for certain non-General Schedule employees regarding locality pay extensions. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System have prevailing rate adjustments capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. In 2004, blue-collar workers in specific locations will receive a pay adjustment no less than the increase received by GS employees in that location. In 2004, blue-collar workers in specific locations will receive a pay adjustment no less than the increase received by GS employees in that location. Special rate employees receive the higher of the special rate or locality payment. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental United States receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. Special rate employees receive the higher of the special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental United States receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The locality-based comparability payments procedure aims to equalize pay rates for GS employees within each locality with a non-federal/federal pay disparity greater than 5%. The locality-based comparability payments procedure under FEPCA aims to equalize pay rates for GS employees within localities with a non-federal/federal pay disparity greater than 5%. The President has the authority to adjust these payments in cases of national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan under FEPCA to adjust locality-based comparability payments in cases of national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to provide a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in each pay area. President Bush's alternative plan in August 2003 included a 0.5% locality pay adjustment for January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 in December 2003. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys in 32 pay areas nationwide to document non-federal pay rates. The surveys were previously conducted under the Occupational Compensation Survey Program until October 1996, and then under the National Compensation Survey program. Survey results are submitted to OPM for comparison with federal rates of pay in each pay area. For the January 2004 locality payments, a phase-in of NCS survey data was approved by OPM to compare federal and non-federal salaries in each pay area. The goal is to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. The OPM compares federal and non-federal salaries in each pay area to determine an overall average percentage pay gap. The goal is to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5% as mandated by law. Twenty percent of the gap was closed in 1994, the first year of locality pay. The target gap, adjusted annually by OPM, aims to reduce the disparity between federal and non-federal salaries. Starting in 1994, 20% of the gap was closed each year, with the goal of closing 90% by 2001. However, the locality pay increases have been implemented at lower percentages, slowing down the reduction of the gap. In 1994, the first year of locality pay, 10% of the gap was to be closed each year, with the goal of closing 90% by 2001. However, the gap closure percentages have been lower each year, slowing down the reduction of the disparity between federal and non-federal salaries. The gap closure percentages have been decreasing each year since 1994, with 44% of the gap closed in 2003. FEPCA specified that payments should reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The Pay Agent recommended locality rates to the President based on a 5% target gap reduction, using 22-month-old data to determine payments. NCS surveys were not used for locality payments in previous years but are being phased in for January 2004 payments. The Pay Agent recommended locality rates to the President based on a 5% target gap reduction using 22-month-old data. The NCS surveys were not used for previous years' payments but are being phased in for January 2004 payments. The March 2002 gaps were determined using OCSP and NCS survey data, ranging from December 2000 to October 2001 for each pay area. The OCSP pay survey data for some areas was at least seven years old. The January 2004 locality payments were determined using outdated survey data ranging from December 2000 to November 1996 for different pay areas, with some data being at least seven years old. The locality payments for January 2004 were based on outdated survey data ranging from December 2000 to November 1996 for different pay areas, with some data being at least seven years old. The data for New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles were as of July 1995, October 1995, and November 1995 respectively. Other pay areas had data from January 1996 to November 1996, with the \"Rest of the United States\" pay area data aged to November 1996. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps were determined by aging the BLS survey data to a common reference date in March 2002 before comparing it to GS pay data. The Federal Salary Council reported in November 1996 that the overall gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries as of March 2002 was 32.02%. The Federal Salary Council reported in March 2002 that the overall pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, a 25.73% increase in salaries was recommended for 2004, with locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 25.73% increase in salaries for 2004 to reduce the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. Locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. Comparing 2003 locality payments with those recommended for 2004, increases ranged from 11.90% to 25.23%. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 25.73% increase in salaries for 2004 to reduce the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. Locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. Comparing 2003 locality payments with those recommended for 2004, increases ranged from 11.90% to 25.23%. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% in 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 25.73% increase in salaries for 2004 to reduce the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. Locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The nationwide average net pay increase, if ECI and locality-based comparability payments were granted, would have been 15.15% in 2004. The council recommended adjustments for areas with pay gaps below RUS. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 25.73% increase in salaries for 2004 to reduce the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas, with resources redirected to new survey locations. The council recommended that these pay areas be included with RUS in 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 25.73% increase in salaries for 2004 to reduce the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas, with resources redirected to new survey locations. The council recommended that these pay areas be included with RUS in 2004. The council plans to consider whether some areas should be dropped and resources used to increase the sample in other locations or add new locality pay surveys. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas [Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis] and considering reallocating resources for new surveys or increasing sample sizes. Criteria for pay area inclusion remain unchanged since 1993. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas and criteria for pay area inclusion remain unchanged since 1993, including factors like county contiguity, minimum GS employees, and economic linkage with the pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas and criteria for pay area inclusion, with the exception of Barnstable County, MA, which is seeking to become part of the Boston pay area due to its unique geographical position. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas and criteria for pay area inclusion, with the exception of Barnstable County, MA, which is seeking to become part of the Boston pay area due to its unique geographical position. Barnstable County is the only county on the eastern seaboard from southern Maine to Delaware not in a separate locality pay area, and the Council voted to recommend this change despite not meeting the criteria of having 2,000 GS employees. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA, in the Boston locality pay area despite not meeting the criteria of having 2,000 GS employees. The Council voted to make an exception in 2004 to address this unique geographical situation. St. Mary's County, MD, has been included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, pay area since 1994. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA, in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address a unique geographical situation. The Council also recommended including St. Mary's County, MD, in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Santa Barbara County, CA, in the Los Angeles pay area and New London, CT, in the Hartford pay area for 2004, despite falling below the employment threshold. The council suggested that once an area is approved, it should not be removed during the locality pay program phase-in. The Federal Salary Council recommended that New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA, continue to be included in their respective pay areas for 2004, despite falling below the employment threshold. The council noted upcoming changes in locality pay area definitions due to new census data and revisions by the Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau. The Federal Salary Council recommended that New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA, remain in their pay areas for 2004. Changes in locality pay area definitions are expected due to new census data and revisions by the Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau. Monterey County, CA, is recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended changes to locality pay areas for 2004 based on new census data. Monterey County, CA, is recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Rhode Island does not meet the criteria for a pay area due to its small size. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Rhode Island in the Boston pay area in 2004 due to its small size, not meeting the criteria for a pay area. Rhode Island is considered as a single county under the recommended criteria. The council recommended adopting \"Full State\" criteria for Rhode Island, treating it as a single county due to its small size. Rhode Island meets the criteria and is recommended for continued inclusion in the Boston pay area in 2004. Installation criteria require at least 1,000 GS employees within 10 miles of the prime-critical federal facility. The council recommended that Edwards Air Force Base be included in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004, despite not meeting the employment criteria. The council recommended including Edwards Air Force Base in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004, despite not meeting employment criteria. The base was included for the same reasons as New London and Santa Barbara. The council recommended including Edwards Air Force Base in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004, along with New London and Santa Barbara. The council's report to the Pay Agent in 2001 suggested improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program, with progress updates provided in 2004. Key improvements included using three factors instead of nine to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs surveyed. The Pay Agent received a progress report on 2004 locality payments, with improvements including using three factors to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs surveyed. OPM developed a four-factor evaluation system, and BLS implemented a new approach in field tests. BLS will phase in the new approach in surveys starting December 2003. BLS also created an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in the surveys. BLS has completed developing a four-factor evaluation system for surveys and successfully used it in field tests. They will start implementing the new approach in surveys from December 2003. Additionally, BLS has designed an econometric model to estimate salaries for non-randomly selected jobs in the surveys. OPM formed an interagency working group to improve job matching between federal and non-federal survey jobs. OPM formed an interagency working group to improve job matching between federal and non-federal survey jobs by developing a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS used this crosswalk and March 2001 GS employment weights for data delivery. Additional improvements are anticipated in the crosswalk, with OPM providing updated GS employment information to BLS annually. Grade levels for supervisory occupations will be adjusted based on the level of supervision. The new approach for grading supervisory occupations involves grading the highest level of work supervised and adjusting the grade level based on the level of supervision. BLS and Pay Agent staff have designed this new method, with final tests to be conducted in the fall before implementation in surveys. BLS and Pay Agent staff have developed a new approach for grading supervisory jobs based on the level of work supervised. Final tests will be conducted in the fall, with implementation planned for December 2003. Criteria have been established to exclude jobs classified above GS-15, and non-Federal jobs above this level have been excluded from the data delivered to the Pay Agent. The BLS and Pay Agent staff developed a new approach for grading supervisory jobs based on the level of work supervised, with final tests planned for December 2003. Criteria were set to exclude jobs above GS-15, and non-Federal jobs above this level were excluded from the data delivered to the Pay Agent. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments in 2004 due to concerns about its reliability. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments in 2004 due to concerns about its reliability and suggested that any further implementation of NCS data must be conditioned on BLS implementing improvements. Additional resources should be allocated to increase sample size in localities with significant pay gaps. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments in 2004 and suggested that further implementation be conditioned on BLS making improvements. Additional resources should be allocated to increase sample size in localities with significant pay gaps. Definition of Metropolitan Areas is based on OMB definitions, which automatically change locality pay areas when OMB revises definitions. On April 22, 2003, OPM published final regulations regarding this. The OPM published final regulations on April 22, 2003, regarding the definition of Metropolitan Areas for locality pay areas. OMB revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas on June 6, 2003, based on new criteria and 2000 census data, with no immediate impact on locality pay areas. OPM published final regulations stating that locality pay areas no longer change automatically with new metropolitan area definitions. OMB revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas on June 6, 2003, but this had no immediate impact on the General Schedule (GS) locality pay program. OPM modified the GS locality pay regulations to align with the former OMB statistical area definitions based on recommendations from the Federal Salary Council. OPM recently modified the GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions, giving the Federal Salary Council and President's Pay Agent an opportunity to review new statistical area definitions before making recommendations in 2003. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent have the opportunity to review new statistical area definitions before making recommendations in 2003. Major changes include the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]' in place of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' for defining locality pay areas. Population density is no longer a criterion. The concept of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' used in defining locality pay areas has been replaced with 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]. Population density is no longer a criterion for evaluating outlying counties, and commuting threshold levels have changed. The Federal Salary Council reviewed new OMB definitions and commuting patterns in two public meetings. The Federal Salary Council reviewed new OMB definitions and commuting patterns in two public meetings, recommending the use of new MSA definitions for the locality pay program. Additional study is needed before any decisions are made. The Federal Salary Council recommended using new MSA definitions for the locality pay program, suggesting additional study before making any decisions. This would potentially add 83 counties to existing metropolitan locality pay areas, excluding some areas in New England. The Federal Salary Council recommended using new MSA definitions for the locality pay program, suggesting additional study before making any decisions. This could potentially add 83 counties to existing metropolitan locality pay areas, excluding some areas in New England. At a second council meeting, the working group recommended adopting the new MSA definitions for locality pay areas. The working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, excluding certain counties and expanding pay area definitions for the January 2005 pay adjustments. The working group recommended changes in MSA definitions for locality pay areas, including the use of Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) and revising pay area definitions for the January 2005 pay adjustments. The council adopted these recommendations to address pay gaps and reallocate resources. The working group recommended changes in MSA definitions for locality pay areas, including the use of Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) and revising pay area definitions for the January 2005 pay adjustments. The council adopted these recommendations to address pay gaps and reallocate resources. Additionally, three current pay areas with pay gaps below RUS will be folded into RUS to survey other areas, with resulting savings in resources. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved by the Pay Agent and will be published for public comments in the Federal Register. The council's recommendations for January 2005 pay adjustments were approved, with proposed changes on locality pay to be published for public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed upon by the House of Representatives, stating that funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. The House of Representatives approved Bill 2004, offered by Representative Sam Farr, on September 4, 2003. The amendment at Section 742 prohibits the use of funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Farr withdrew a similar amendment during the bill's markup, but later testified about potential pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey. Representative Sam Farr withdrew a proposed amendment after the Committee chairman agreed to work with him. Farr testified about potential pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Jack Reed offered a similar amendment that was agreed to by the Senate. Senator Jack Reed offered an amendment similar to Representative Farr's to prevent pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. The Senate agreed to the amendment during the consideration of the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. The amendment ensured that no funds could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. The Treasury appropriations bill amendment on October 23, 2003, prohibited the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This amendment was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 incorporated H.R. 2989 into H.R. 2673. Section 644 of the conference agreement prohibits funds from being used to enforce regulations for locality pay areas in FY2004 that are inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations. This provision became Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its report to the President after considering the council's recommendations for the 2004 locality pay. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report to the President on the 2004 locality payments on December 5, 2002, recommending adjustments for January 2004 based on current law. However, due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they believe adjustments should be reconsidered. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for 2004 locality payments in their annual report to the President on December 5, 2002. Due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they advised against implementing the proposed pay increases in January 2004, suggesting alternative compensation approaches for Federal employees. The Pay Agent recommended against implementing locality pay increases in January 2004 due to concerns about the current compensation process for Federal employees. The cost of these proposed payments would be $8.830. The Pay Agent recommended against implementing locality pay increases in January 2004 due to concerns about the current compensation process for Federal employees. The cost of the January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion if the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5% were provided in January 2004 as required by FEPCA. Table 1 includes the council's and the Pay Agent's recommended locality payments for January 2004, with the Pay Agent not adopting the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, as part of the Boston locality pay area due to the need for further review of commuting patterns and metropolitan area definitions based on the 2000 census data. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area, citing the need for further review of commuting patterns and metropolitan area definitions based on 2000 census data. The recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, focusing on issues with random job selection, matching federal and non-federal jobs, and excluding jobs above GS-15. The Pay Agent implemented recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, addressing issues with random job selection, matching federal and non-federal jobs, and excluding jobs above GS-15. They look forward to reviewing the results of the data next year. The Pay Agent implemented improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on assigning GS grades to randomly selected survey jobs. They look forward to reviewing the results of the data next year. The Pay Agent implemented improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on assigning GS grades to randomly selected survey jobs. The last two improvements in NCS surveys will affect data in 2005. President George W. Bush issued his administration's FY2004 budget in February. President George W. Bush's FY2004 budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, with uncertainty on how it would be allocated between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA in January 2004. The statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2004 is 2.7%, and any changes to this rate would need to be decided by the President. The FY2004 budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, with uncertainty on allocation between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA in January 2004. The President must submit alternative plans for any changes to the annual adjustment by September 1, 2003, and for locality payments by November 30, 2003. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay, costing about $2 billion dollars. The President's alternative plan, issued on August 27, 2003, called for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay, costing about $2 billion. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented this plan. The President's alternative plan, costing $2 billion, included a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented this plan and also introduced a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund, authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136, rewards high-performing employees in an agency. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, contingent upon enactment of legislation authorizing the fund within OPM. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, contingent upon enactment of legislation authorizing the fund within OPM. The funding obligation was dependent on the approval of a performance pay plan for an agency by the OPM Director and prior approval from relevant subcommittees. OPM was directed to report annually to the Committees on Appropriations on approved performance pay plans and obligated amounts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. They believe such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in H.R. 2989. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. They suggested that such initiatives should be managed within individual agencies. Funding was also not included in H.R. 2989, which was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 with an appropriation of $1 million. Funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the fund, contingent upon the enactment of legislation to establish it within OPM. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, contingent upon legislation to establish it within OPM. The OPM Director must approve and notify relevant subcommittees before funds can be transferred to federal agencies for performance pay plans. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 allocated $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, subject to OPM approval. The President's alternative plan suggested a 2% pay raise limit to avoid unfunded costs, potentially leading to hiring freezes due to increased expenses. Federal employee union representatives expressed concerns about the 2.0% pay raise. The President proposed a 2% pay raise limit to avoid unfunded costs, potentially leading to hiring freezes. Federal employee union representatives expressed concerns about the 2.0% pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the substantial resources needed to maintain it. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it, proposing a broad-band system with fewer pay grades and more flexibility in determining individual pay based on competence and performance. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended replacing the General Schedule classification system with a broad-band system to simplify pay grades and allow for more flexibility in determining individual pay based on competence and performance. This system would ensure equal pay for equal work and is currently being implemented at various agencies. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended replacing the General Schedule classification system with a broad-band system to simplify pay grades and allow for more flexibility in determining individual pay based on competence and performance. Pay banding systems are being implemented at several agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service.

They believe civilian and military pay linkage is unnecessary and have suggested a Human Capital Performance Fund for higher pay raises for high-performing federal employees. The Administration has proposed a Human Capital Performance Fund to finance higher pay raises for high-performing federal employees, with concerns about unfunded civilian pay increases costing DOD and Government-wide. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay increases costing DOD and Government-wide, with pay raises exceeding inflation rates. The Statement of Administration Policy expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The FY2004 Agencies Appropriations Bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation, statutory base pay increase, and private-sector pay increase. However, the higher pay raise does not address Federal employee turnover issues. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the FY2004 Agencies Appropriations Bill exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increase. However, it does not address Federal employee turnover issues. According to a recent survey, Federal employees are satisfied with their pay rate and have a low quit rate. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security could limit agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. The statement highlights that the quit rate among Federal employees is at an all-time low of 1.7 percent per year, below the private sector average.

Congress could examine the federal white-collar pay-setting system. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. Congress could examine ways to amend FEPCA to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. FEPCA aims to reduce the salary gap between non-federal and federal employees to 5%, with target pay gaps for each pay area. However, the law has not been fully implemented as intended, with only a small percentage of the target pay gaps being closed each year. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address this issue. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) aimed to reduce the salary gap between non-federal and federal employees to 5% by closing target pay gaps each year. However, only a small percentage of the target pay gaps has been closed annually, resulting in a 25.73% average pay disparity in 2004. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment. The Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent report a 25.73% pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries in 2004. Concerns have been raised about the flawed methodology for setting federal pay adjustments since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Despite these concerns, no proposals have been made to change FEPCA. The current methodology for setting federal pay adjustments is criticized for data completeness variations, lack of credibility in gaps, and a one-size-fits-all approach. Concerns have not led to changes in FEPCA, with survey data from previous years being used due to unapproved BLS surveys. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments is criticized for data completeness variations and lack of credibility. Survey data from previous years is used due to unapproved BLS surveys. In response, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on methodological concerns. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 directed the President's Pay Agent to report on methodological concerns regarding federal pay adjustments. The Pay Agent reiterated these concerns in a report to Congress in May 2001 and improvements to the survey methodology are currently being implemented. The Office of Personnel Management issued a white paper in April 2002 reviewing current policies and the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule. The Pay Agent reported to Congress in May 2001, addressing methodological concerns. Improvements to survey methodology are in progress. A white paper by the Office of Personnel Management in April 2002 reviewed current policies on General Schedule pay. The Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule pay with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. Results showed that federal employees in professional and administrative roles earned less than private sector counterparts, with 85% lagging by over 20%. In contrast, 30% of federal employees in technical and clerical roles had salaries higher than private sector counterparts. Federal employees in professional and administrative occupations generally earn less than private sector counterparts, with 85% lagging by over 20%. In contrast, 30% of federal employees in technical and clerical roles have salaries higher than private sector counterparts. Jobs in technical and clerical occupations show smaller pay differences, with about three-quarters of federal employees in these roles having salaries within 10% of private levels. The analysis by CBO highlighted that federal employees in professional and administrative occupations earn less than their private sector counterparts, with 85% lagging by over 20%. However, jobs in technical and clerical roles show smaller pay differences, with about three-quarters of federal employees in these positions having salaries within 10% of private levels. The federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation is a long-standing concern, potentially resulting in smaller pay raises for employees in professional and administrative roles. CBO concluded that the federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation is a long-standing concern, potentially resulting in smaller pay raises for employees in professional and administrative roles. The federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation may result in above-market salaries for some groups and below-market salaries for others, failing to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs as envisioned in FEPCA. This issue is exacerbated by the increasing share of federal workers in jobs with the greatest pay disadvantage. The lack of variation in pay raises by occupation in the federal pay system may lead to above-market salaries for some groups and below-market salaries for others, failing to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs as intended in FEPCA. The increasing share of federal workers in occupations with the greatest pay disadvantage exacerbates this issue. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is also a concern, with estimated locality-based comparability payments in January 2004 totaling $8.830 billion. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimated locality-based comparability payments in January 2004 totaling $8.830 billion.
