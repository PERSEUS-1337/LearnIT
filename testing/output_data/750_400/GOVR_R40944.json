    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an original work of authorship. Protection is automatic when the work is created, but registration offers advantages such as the ability to file infringement suits and receive statutory damages and attorney's fees if done within three months of publication. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office provides advantages such as the ability to file infringement suits and receive statutory damages and attorney's fees if done within three months of publication. In a 2001 Supreme Court case, New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued over their exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work contributed to publications like The New York Times and Newsday. In a 2001 Supreme Court case, New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for licensing their articles to electronic databases without permission. The publishers argued that they had the right to reproduce and distribute the articles as part of collective works. The Supreme Court ruled in New York Times Co. v. Tasini that publishers cannot electronically reproduce freelance works without specific authorization, requiring them to obtain a separate license from the author. The Supreme Court's decision in New York Times Co. v. Tasini prohibited publishers from electronically reproducing freelance works without specific authorization, leading to the removal of many freelance works from electronic databases. This decision also activated and consolidated preexisting class action infringement suits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Tasini decision led to the removal of freelance works from electronic databases and activated class action infringement suits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick is a class action lawsuit involving multiple claims. Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick is a class action lawsuit in the District of New York, part of a consolidated litigation involving similar claims. Class actions allow named plaintiffs to sue on behalf of a larger group with common issues, requiring court certification for litigation to proceed. In Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick, class actions allow named plaintiffs to sue on behalf of a larger group with common issues, requiring court certification for litigation to proceed. Litigation may proceed only after the court has certified the class, and settlement or voluntary dismissal of the suit requires court approval. Any class member may object to a settlement proposal, but the objection may only be withdrawn with the court's permission. The plaintiffs in Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick are individual authors and trade groups representing authors who brought a copyright infringement suit against publishers and electronic database services for reproducing their freelance works without consent. Class members can object to a settlement proposal, but withdrawal of objections requires court permission. The publishers reproduced freelance authors' articles in electronic databases without consent, leading to a copyright infringement lawsuit. After the Tasini decision affirmed authors' rights, the parties reached a settlement in 2005 after three years of negotiations, categorizing plaintiffs' claims for compensation. In 2005, a settlement was reached after three years of negotiations following a copyright infringement lawsuit over electronic reproduction of works. Plaintiffs' claims were categorized into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. The settlement in 2005 categorized plaintiffs' claims into three groups for compensation based on the type of copyright infringement. Category A claims were eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B claims qualified for actual damages, and Category C claims largely involved unregistered copyrights. Each category received a damages formula, with Category A claimants receiving a flat fee, Category B claimants receiving a flat fee or a percentage of the original price, and Category C claimants receiving a similar compensation structure. The settlement in 2005 categorized plaintiffs' claims into three groups for compensation based on the type of copyright infringement. Category A claimants received a flat fee, Category B claimants received a flat fee or a percentage of the original price, and Category C claimants also received a similar compensation structure. If the total cost of claims exceeded $18 million, Category C claimants' payments could be reduced or even eliminated before affecting Category A and B claimants. This reduction was known as the \"C-reduction.\" The settlement in 2005 categorized plaintiffs' claims into three groups for compensation based on the type of copyright infringement. Category A claimants received a flat fee, Category B claimants received a flat fee or a percentage of the original price, and Category C claimants also received a similar compensation structure. If the total cost of claims exceeded $18 million, Category C claimants' payments could be reduced or even eliminated before affecting Category A and B claimants. This reduction was known as the \"C-reduction.\" In return for financial compensation, plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against defendants related to their articles' appearance in electronic databases. The plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against the defendants in exchange for financial compensation. They then sought class certification and settlement approval, which was opposed by objectors who argued that the settlement was unfair to Category C claimants. The objectors believed that the named plaintiffs did not adequately represent Category C claimants, who were paid less and faced reductions if total claims exceeded $18 million. The settlement was challenged by objectors who argued that Category C claimants were treated unfairly and inadequately represented. Defendants countered that Category C claimants were fairly treated as they would not have been able to bring infringement actions without registered copyrights. The defendants argued that Category C claimants, with unregistered copyrights, were adequately represented in the settlement despite objections. The district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005, but objectors appealed, questioning the fairness and representation of the named plaintiffs. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised concerns before oral argument. After final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005, objectors appealed the fairness and representation of unregistered copyrights. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns before oral argument. The District Court and parties addressed a jurisdictional question regarding claims of unregistered copyrights. Both plaintiffs and defendants argued that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional, stating that a single claim based on a registered copyright gives the court jurisdiction over related claims, even if unregistered. The Second Circuit disagreed with the argument that a single claim based on a registered copyright gives jurisdiction over related claims, even if unregistered. They stated that federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright actions. The Second Circuit disagreed with the argument that jurisdiction in copyright cases extends to related claims based on unregistered copyrights. They emphasized that federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright actions, deriving jurisdiction from specific sections of Title 28 of the U.S. Code. The Second Circuit court stated that jurisdiction in copyright cases is derived from specific sections of Title 28 of the U.S. Code, \u00a71331 and \u00a71338. They highlighted that district courts' subject-matter jurisdiction is limited to claims arising from registered copyrights only, as per \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act. The appellate court emphasized that district courts' jurisdiction in copyright cases is restricted to claims from registered copyrights only, as per \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act. They ruled that copyright registration prior to an infringement suit is jurisdictional, citing previous cases and distinguishing a Supreme Court ruling. Many of the plaintiffs' copyrights were unregistered, affecting the outcome. The Second Circuit held that copyright registration prior to an infringement suit is jurisdictional, and unregistered copyrights affected the court's authority to certify a class and approve a settlement. Judge Walker dissented, arguing against this jurisdictional defect. The Second Circuit ruled that unregistered copyrights impacted the court's ability to certify a class and approve a settlement, leading to a jurisdictional defect. Judge Walker disagreed, suggesting a re-evaluation of the copyright registration requirement. The Second Circuit's ruling on unregistered copyrights impacting class certification and settlement approval was challenged by Judge Walker, who argued that the copyright registration requirement should be re-evaluated based on the Supreme Court's guidance in Eberhart. He categorized \u00a7411(a) as an \"enforcement mechanism\" and emphasized that the absence of registration should not invalidate a class-action settlement. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case regarding whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. The Second Circuit's ruling on unregistered copyrights impacting class certification was challenged, arguing that copyright registration should not invalidate a class-action settlement. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) limits federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. This section states that no civil action for copyright infringement can be filed without copyright registration. The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) limits federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. This section requires copyright registration before filing a civil action for infringement. If registration is refused, the applicant can still sue by serving notice on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may choose to become a party in the action within sixty days. The applicant can bring a civil action for infringement by serving notice and a copy of the complaint on the Register of Copyrights. The Register has the option to join the action within sixty days. Petitioners argue that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is mandatory, not a jurisdictional restriction. The Register's failure to become a party does not deprive the court of jurisdiction. Petitioners argue that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is mandatory for a civil action, not a jurisdictional restriction. They claim that even if it is jurisdictional, it only applies to initiating the suit. Petitioners argued that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is not intended to be jurisdictional, and even if it is, it only applies to initiating actions, not settling them. They warned that the Second Circuit's interpretation could hinder parties from reaching negotiated settlements. The registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is argued to only apply to initiating actions, not settling them. If the Second Circuit's interpretation stands, it could hinder parties from reaching negotiated settlements involving unregistered works. Respondents argue that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is not a bar to jurisdiction but a claim-processing rule that could be waived by defendants. They cite cases where the jurisdiction requirement was relaxed, suggesting it is not subject-matter jurisdictional. This could impact parties' ability to settle disputes involving unregistered works. Respondents argued that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is a claim-processing rule that could be waived by defendants, citing cases where the jurisdiction requirement was relaxed. They also claimed that even without original subject-matter jurisdiction, the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the case. The United States supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment. The court had supplemental jurisdiction over the case despite lacking original subject-matter jurisdiction because the claims of authors with unregistered copyrights were related to those with registered copyrights. The United States, as amicus curiae, supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite to suit that should be strictly enforced. The U.S. supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite to suit that should be strictly enforced, even though non-compliance with the registration requirement in this case should not be a basis for vacating the district court's decision. The U.S. argued that non-compliance with the registration requirement should not be a basis for vacating the district court's judgment, as it would waste judicial resources. Both petitioners and respondents wanted the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit's ruling, leading to the appointment of an amicus curiae to support the Second Circuit. The U.S. argued against vacating the district court's judgment based on non-compliance with the registration requirement. An amicus curiae was appointed to support the Second Circuit's ruling, emphasizing that \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction and serves vital public purposes. Professor Merritt will serve as amicus curiae in support of the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction and serves vital public purposes such as maintaining a public record of copyright claims and protecting defendants from frivolous lawsuits. She also contends that the parties cannot waive \u00a7411(a) due to the integrity of the judicial process. Professor Merritt argues that \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction by serving public purposes like maintaining a public record of copyright claims and protecting defendants from frivolous lawsuits. She also asserts that parties cannot waive \u00a7411(a) due to the integrity of the judicial process. Professor Merritt argued that the jurisdictional defect in the settlement was not cured by a special rule or the supplemental jurisdiction act, as courts must have jurisdiction over class actions to terminate claims of absent class members. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's judgment. The jurisdictional defect in the settlement was not cured by a special rule or the supplemental jurisdiction act, as courts must have jurisdiction over class actions to terminate claims of absent class members. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that the registration requirement is a necessary protection for Internet service providers, reducing their potential exposure to copyright infringement claims. The CCIA supported the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that the registration requirement is a necessary protection for Internet service providers, reducing their potential exposure to copyright infringement claims. They stated that the Second Circuit's opinion was correctly decided and that the petitioners' writ of certoriari should be dismissed on two grounds. CCIA supported the Second Circuit's judgment on the registration requirement for Internet service providers to reduce exposure to copyright infringement claims. They argued that the petitioners' writ of certoriari should be dismissed due to lack of case or controversy and no circuit split on \u00a7411(a) jurisdiction. The Supreme Court heard oral argument in Reed Elsevier on October 7, 2009. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Second Circuit's judgment on the registration requirement for copyright infringement claims. Justice Thomas authored the opinion, stating that while registration is necessary to file a claim, it does not limit federal court jurisdiction. On March 2, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's judgment on the Copyright Act's registration requirement for copyright infringement claims. Justice Thomas ruled that registration is a precondition to filing a claim but does not limit federal court jurisdiction. The district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement between freelance authors, publishers, and electronic databases. The Supreme Court ruled that federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works. This allows the district court to certify the class and approve settlements between freelance authors, publishers, and electronic databases. The Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction pertains to the court's power to adjudicate the case, not the rights or obligations of parties. The Supreme Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the court's power to adjudicate a case, not the rights or obligations of parties. It distinguished between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules or elements of a claim, following the approach outlined in the 2006 decision, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. The Supreme Court distinguished between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules or elements of a claim, following the approach outlined in the 2006 decision, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. The Arbaugh Court held that a statutory limitation on coverage should be treated as nonjurisdictional if Congress does not rank it as jurisdictional. In a sexual harassment case under Title VII, the Court found that the numerical qualification for \"employer\" was a substantive element. The Arbaugh Court ruled that the numerical qualification for \"employer\" under Title VII was a substantive element of the claim, not affecting federal court jurisdiction. The Arbaugh Court determined that the employee numerosity requirement for \"employer\" in Title VII was a substantive element of the claim, not impacting federal court jurisdiction. This decision was based on the observation that the requirement was not clearly jurisdictional, and previous Supreme Court cases had not suggested otherwise. The Reed Elsevier Court applied this precedent to \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act. The Reed Elsevier Court applied the Arbaugh precedent to \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act, rejecting the argument that the registration requirement was jurisdictional. The Court emphasized that the presence of the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute did not explicitly label it as such. The Court in Arbaugh did not find that Congress explicitly labeled \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement as jurisdictional. It rejected the argument based on the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute, stating it was Congress' intent to clarify federal court authority for determining registrability. The Court clarified that federal courts have adjudicatory authority to determine the issue of registrability, regardless of the Register's involvement in the infringement suit. Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act grants jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions, separate from provisions in Title 28. The Copyright Act, located in Title 17 of the U.S. Code, grants federal courts jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions, separate from provisions in Title 28. Section 411(a) allows courts to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works in certain circumstances. The Court highlighted exceptions to the requirement for registration before suing for infringement under \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act, allowing courts to handle claims involving unregistered works in specific situations. The Court emphasized exceptions to the registration requirement for infringement claims under \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act, allowing for cases involving non-U.S. works, rights of attribution and integrity, or refused registrations. The Court distinguished its decision in Bowles v. Russell, applying the Arbaugh precedent to nonjurisdictional statutory prerequisites. The Court cited earlier decisions on nonjurisdictional statutory prerequisites, distinguishing the Bowles v. Russell case regarding appeal deadlines. The Bowles case examined a statutory provision requiring parties to file a notice of appeal within 30 days. The Court noted that historical precedents treated the limitation for taking an appeal as jurisdictional. The Reed Elsevier Court explained that the statutory condition for taking an appeal may be properly ranked as jurisdictional. The registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is not jurisdictional but more akin to an employee numerosity requirement. The Court rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a) should be construed as jurisdictional. The Court determined that \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement is not jurisdictional, likening it to an employee numerosity requirement. The Court rejected the argument that it should be construed as jurisdictional to promote policy goals and congressional objectives. The Court also declined to affirm the appellate court's judgment based on estoppel grounds. The Court declined to affirm the appellate court's judgment on estoppel grounds, noting that the parties' assertion that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional in defending the settlement agreement followed existing precedent. The parties' assertion that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional in defending the settlement agreement followed existing precedent in the Second Circuit. The District Court did not adopt this interpretation, and the Second Circuit rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a) did not restrict subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court did not adopt petitioners' interpretation of \u00a7 411(a) as jurisdictional, which was rejected by the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court did not express an opinion on the fairness of the settlement. The Supreme Court rejected the circuit's decision, stating that it would not lead to inconsistent court determinations in favor of the petitioners. The court did not express an opinion on the fairness of the settlement, leaving it to be considered by the court of appeals. The question of whether \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement claims remains open for lower courts to decide. Justice Ginsburg did not provide a definitive answer on this issue. The Supreme Court rejected the circuit's decision and left the fairness of the settlement to be considered by the court of appeals. The question of whether \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement claims remains open for lower courts to decide. Justice Ginsburg, along with Justices Stevens and Breyer, agreed that \u00a7411(a) should be treated as a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim without restricting federal court jurisdiction. Justice Ginsburg, along with Justices Stevens and Breyer, agreed that \u00a7411(a) should be treated as a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim without restricting federal court jurisdiction. She noted a tension between previous rulings and offered her interpretation to reconcile them, emphasizing the need for clear rules on what statutory conditions qualify as jurisdictional. Justice Ginsburg addressed the tension between the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents regarding jurisdictional conditions, offering her interpretation to reconcile the rulings. The Arbaugh Court established a rule that statutory conditions are jurisdictional only if Congress explicitly states so, while the Bowles Court considered the time limit for filing a notice of appeal as jurisdictional based on long-standing Supreme Court precedents. Justice Ginsburg reconciled the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents on jurisdictional conditions by suggesting that Bowles relied on longstanding Supreme Court decisions untouched by Congress. This supports the view that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional as it lacks jurisdictional language or references to district court jurisdiction. Ginsburg reconciled Bowles and Arbaugh by noting that Bowles relied on Supreme Court decisions unaffected by Congress. She argued that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional as it lacks jurisdictional language. The over 200 opinions characterizing \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional are from lower courts, not the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg argued that Bowles does not apply to the Copyright Act's registration requirement, as it lacks jurisdictional language and the opinions characterizing it as jurisdictional are from lower courts, not the Supreme Court. The Reed Elsevier case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider the settlement's merits. If approved, freelance authors will receive compensation and electronic databases can restore publications. The Reed Elsevier case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider the settlement's merits and objections. If upheld, freelance authors will receive compensation and electronic databases can restore publications. The appellate court may focus on objections to the damages formula. The appellate court will review objections to the damages formula in the Reed Elsevier case, particularly focusing on the lack of a sub-class for \"C-class\" claims and potential favoritism towards \"A-class\" and \"B-class\" claims. The lack of a sub-class for \"C-class\" claims in the Reed Elsevier case may lead to favoritism towards \"A-class\" and \"B-class\" claims, potentially resulting in little or no payment for C-class claim holders. This could have implications for copyright holders in future infringement cases. The Reed Elsevier case may result in favoritism towards A-class and B-class claims, potentially leaving C-class claim holders with little or no payment. This could impact copyright holders in future infringement cases, allowing participation in settlements and lawsuits even without registering their works. District courts may still dismiss copyright infringement claims for unregistered works. The Reed Elsevier case allows copyright holders to participate in settlements and lawsuits without registering their works. District courts may dismiss copyright infringement claims for unregistered works, but federal courts can approve class action settlements involving both registered and unregistered works. This clarifies the Court's jurisdiction on copyright law litigation. The Reed Elsevier case reaffirms federal courts' authority to approve copyright infringement class action settlements involving both registered and unregistered works, clarifying the Court's jurisdiction in copyright law litigation. It also reaffirms the clear statement rule as the primary test for statutory limitations."
