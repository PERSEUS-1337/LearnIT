    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grant and loan programs, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS. NTIA/DOC received $4.35 billion for a competitive broadband grant program, including infrastructure grants, public computer capacity expansion, and grants for broadband service adoption. The ARRA allocated $4.35 billion to NTIA/DOC for a broadband grant program called BTOP, and $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations, with a focus on serving rural areas. The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) allocated $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations, with a requirement that 75% of the area served must be rural. The RUS broadband grant and loan program is known as the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP). The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) allocated $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations, with a requirement that 75% of the area served must be rural. The RUS broadband grant and loan program is called the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP). P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money from NTIA. Two rounds of ARRA broadband funding were announced, with all funding mandated to be obligated and awarded by September 30, 2010. The ARRA broadband funding rounds were announced in July 2009 and January 2010, with all funds required to be awarded by September 30, 2010. By October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds had been distributed. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding. The ARRA broadband funding rounds were announced in July 2009 and January 2010, with all funds required to be awarded by September 30, 2010. By October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds had been distributed. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding, including a breakdown of applications and awards data. The first funding round included projects categorized as last mile and middle mile broadband infrastructure projects. Broadband grants and loans were available through the NOFA on July 1, 2009. Projects fell into categories such as last mile, middle mile, and public computer centers. Up to $1.2 billion in grants were available for last mile and middle mile infrastructure projects, while up to $50 million was allocated for public computer centers. The Broadband grants and loans available through the NOFA on July 1, 2009 included funding for last mile and middle mile infrastructure projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Last mile projects in remote areas could receive up to $400 million in grants. The Broadband grants and loans available through the NOFA on July 1, 2009 included funding for last mile and middle mile infrastructure projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Projects could be last mile remote area (up to $400 million in grants), last mile nonremote area (up to $800 million in loans and loan/grant combinations available), or middle mile (up to $800 million in loans and loan/grant combinations available). On September 9, 2009, NTIA and RUS released data on applications received during the first round application period, totaling over 2,200 applications. On September 9, 2009, NTIA and RUS released data on applications received during the first round application period. Over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding for projects reaching all 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. Total federal funding requested was seven times the amount available in the first funding round. Table 1 provides a breakdown of first round applications data for ARRA broadband funding. NTIA and RUS announced the second and final round with $4.8 billion available, $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. Public comments from November 16 were considered for this round. In the second and final round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS released NOFAs on January 15, 2010, with $4.8 billion available ($2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP). Changes were made based on feedback from the first round, including separate NOFAs for each agency and the option for applicants to choose between BTOP and BIP. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS streamlined the application process based on feedback from the first round. Each agency had its own separate NOFA, and applicants could choose to apply to either BTOP or BIP. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP reoriented its infrastructure program towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI) grants. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, applicants could choose to apply to either BTOP or BIP. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP reoriented its program towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI) grants, supporting middle mile projects for anchor institutions. BIP offered a standard grant/loan combination for all last mile and middle mile projects. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP offered a standard grant/loan combination for last mile and middle mile projects. The requirement for projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated, with a focus on rural areas lacking High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects only required an eligible applicant. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP projects were required to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects required an eligible applicant, completed application, and a 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered during evaluation. BIP added new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. RUS published a separate Request for Proposals. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP projects needed to cover 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband. Eligible BTOP projects required an eligible applicant, completed application, and a 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered during evaluation. BIP introduced new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion in requested federal funding. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA received 867 applications totaling $11 billion in federal funding.

Funding breakdown by technology includes 47% fiber, 23% DSL, 17% wireless, 6% multiple, 3% cable modem, and 1% satellite. State-by-state funding details are provided in tables in the Appendix. The broadband awards process has concluded, and NTIA and RUS are now monitoring and overseeing the funded projects. Projects must be completed within two to three years. State-by-state breakdown of funding is provided in tables in the Appendix. In its FY2011 budget proposal, the Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA to continue operating its grant management office. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extension Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-322), includes a $20 million addition to the Salaries and Expenses account for NTIA and RUS to monitor and oversee funded broadband projects. In FY2011, the Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office. The Continuing Appropriations Act added $20 million for BTOP oversight. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure BTOP grant impact on broadband availability and adoption. In addition to the Salaries and Expenses account, NTIA has awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability, adoption, and economic and social conditions in grantee areas. The 112th Congress is expected to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects, while the FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects, while the FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of BTOP and BIP projects could provide insights into the future of broadband grant and loan programs. The funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of BTOP and BIP projects could offer insights into the future of broadband grant and loan programs, helping determine whether they should be continued, modified, reduced, expanded, or eliminated within the context of a national broadband policy."
