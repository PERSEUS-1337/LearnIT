Congress recognizes that ineffective wastewater treatment is a common source of water pollution, with nutrient pollution, especially phosphorus loading, being a significant issue in the Great Lakes System. It is crucial to limit phosphorus loads to control algal growth, and implementing nutrient removal technology is a reliable and cost-effective method to reduce harmful nutrients from point sources. Excessive algal growth in the Great Lakes System requires urgent action to change nutrient discharge. Nutrient removal technology is a reliable and cost-effective method to reduce harmful nutrients from point sources. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program is established to address excessive algal growth in the Great Lakes System by reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing nutrients in wastewater. The Administrator will establish a grant program to install nutrient removal technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities to reduce total nutrients in discharged wastewater, giving priority to eligible facilities. The Administrator will establish a grant program to install nutrient removal technologies in eligible facilities in Great Lakes States and municipalities to reduce total nutrients in discharged wastewater, with priority given to facilities that would produce the greatest nutrient load reductions at points of discharge and result in the greatest environmental benefits to the Great Lakes. The grant program will prioritize the installation of nutrient removal technologies in eligible facilities in Great Lakes States and municipalities to achieve significant nutrient load reductions at discharge points, provide environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and meet nutrient objectives outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. The grant program aims to install nutrient removal technologies in eligible facilities in Great Lakes States and municipalities to reduce nutrient load at discharge points and achieve environmental benefits for the Great Lakes System. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants by submitting the required information to the Administrator. The Protocol of 2012 allows Great Lakes States or municipalities to apply for grants to install nutrient removal technologies. If approved, the Administrator may grant up to 55 percent of the installation cost. The Administrator may grant up to 55 percent of the cost for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities under the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility eligible for nutrient removal technology installation under the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. The term 'eligible facility' in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day within the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 defines an eligible facility as a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day within the Great Lakes System. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorization of appropriations is provided for eligible facilities within the Great Lakes System, with $100,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020. Authorization of $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 for eligible facilities in the Great Lakes System, with funds remaining available until expended. The Administrator may use up to 4 percent for administrative costs."
