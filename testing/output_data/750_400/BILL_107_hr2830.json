The Voting Restoration Act aims to restore voting rights by ensuring that the right to vote in all governmental elections is not denied based on race, sex, color, or previous conditions of servitude. Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, and there is no uniform eligibility standard for participating in Federal elections due to different rules in each state regarding ex-felon voting eligibility. Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Different States have varying rules on ex-felon voting eligibility, with some disenfranchising ex-offenders even after completing their sentences. In the United States, 48 States and the District of Columbia prohibit inmates from voting while serving their sentences. 13 States disenfranchise some or all ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. The process to regain voting rights is challenging, with requirements such as a pardon or order from the Governor in 8 States, parole or pardon board action in 2 States, and Federal offenders needing a Presidential pardon in 16 States. An estimated 3,900,000 Americans, or approximately 2 percent of the adult population, are currently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. Three-fourths of these individuals are on probation, parole, or are ex-offenders.

Crack and powder cocaine disparities have led to African-Americans representing 31% of Federal drug convictions, despite being only 12% of the population.
