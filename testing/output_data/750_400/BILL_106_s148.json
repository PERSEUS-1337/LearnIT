Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate among countries, with many neotropical migratory bird populations in decline, jeopardizing their long-term survival in the wild. These birds provide valuable environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to the United States and the Western Hemisphere. Neotropical migratory bird populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation, posing a threat to their long-term survival in the wild. Conservation efforts require the commitment of all countries along their migration routes. The decline in neotropical migratory bird populations is primarily due to habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and contamination.

The Act defines the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account and outlines conservation measures including population protection, habitat management, research, and law enforcement. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act focuses on protecting and managing bird populations, habitat, research, law enforcement, and community outreach.
