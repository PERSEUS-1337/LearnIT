    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs by shifting storage from current purposes like hydropower or navigation. The agency is studying reallocation of storage for M&I use at dams in multiple states, with more requests anticipated. This reallocation involves tradeoffs by shifting storage from current purposes like hydropower or navigation. Congress recognized state primacy in M&I water supply development in the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a major role. Congress acknowledged state primacy in developing M&I water supplies in the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal government recognizes the primary responsibilities of states and local interests in developing water supplies for various purposes. Federal participation is encouraged in connection with construction, maintenance, and operation of projects, primarily focusing on flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose dams. The federal government has invested in water resources infrastructure for projects like flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose dams. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers have been involved in constructing these projects. Since the 1960s, federal dam construction has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on balancing competing objectives. Since the 1960s, federal dam construction has decreased due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now emphasizes balancing competing objectives in operating existing reservoirs rather than planning new projects. Congress authorizes the Corps to construct dams and other water resources infrastructure. The Corps operates existing reservoirs to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Each dam and reservoir is managed based on specific project purposes outlined in legislation. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. The Corps operates reservoirs for authorized purposes and compliance with federal laws. Specific project purposes are outlined in legislation, with approximately 91 reservoirs having M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Congress has also included additional requirements for all Corps facilities. The Corps operates reservoirs for authorized purposes, with M&I storage as an authorized purpose for some reservoirs. Congress has additional requirements for all Corps facilities, including fish and wildlife protection. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and the Flood Control Act of 1944. This authority allows the Corps to provide surplus water for M&I use on a temporary basis. The 1958 WSA and Section 6 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 provide the Corps limited authority to supply M&I water. The focus is on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoirs with reallocated storage. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoirs with reallocated storage under the Corps' discretionary authority. For legal issues related to the 1958 WSA, refer to CRS Report R40714 by Cynthia Brougher. The 1958 WSA granted the Corps authority to reallocate storage in reservoir projects without congressional approval. Congress limited the agency's decision-making power under Section 301 of the act. The 1958 WSA granted the Corps authority to reallocate storage in reservoir projects without congressional approval, but limited the agency's decision-making power under Section 301 of the act. Modifications for water supply must be approved by Congress if they seriously affect the project's authorized purposes. The 1958 WSA granted the Corps authority to reallocate storage in reservoir projects without congressional approval, but modifications for water supply that seriously affect the project's authorized purposes require congressional authorization. Congress did not define what constitutes a serious effect or major change, leading the Corps to develop guidance for implementation in EM 1165-2-105. The 1958 WSA granted the Corps authority to reallocate storage in reservoir projects without congressional approval, but modifications for water supply that seriously affect authorized purposes require congressional authorization. Congress did not define what constitutes a serious effect or major change, leading the Corps to develop guidance for implementation in EM 1165-2-105. In March 1977, the Corps adopted a provision for determining when reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for water supply purposes does not require congressional approval. The reallocation is considered insignificant if it is not greater than 15% of total storage capacity allocated to all authorized purposes or 50,000 acre feet, whichever is less. Earlier guidance did not include numeric criteria. The Corps adopted a provision in March 1977 stating that reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for water supply purposes is insignificant if it does not exceed 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet. Recent attention has been on whether the Corps has exceeded its discretionary authority and the number of reservoirs with storage reallocated, following a federal court decision related to operations at Lake Lanier. The Corps' discretionary authority and reservoir storage reallocations have come under scrutiny after a federal court decision regarding operations at Lake Lanier. Lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated in 2007, with a court order in 2009 addressing the Corps' violation of the 1958 WSA in changing Lake Lanier operations for water supply without congressional approval. The court largely agreed with Florida's concerns. In 2007, lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. A July 17, 2009 court order addressed the Corps' violation of the 1958 WSA by making changes to Lake Lanier operations for water supply without congressional approval. The court agreed with Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers that the Corps needed congressional approval for water supply changes. The court estimated that the Corps had reallocated reservoir storage since the mid-1970s. The court order agreed with Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers that the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval since the mid-1970s, totaling roughly 260,000 acre-feet. This reallocation shifted storage from hydropower to municipal and industrial supply. The Corps reallocated 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval, totaling 260,000 acre-feet since the mid-1970s. This shift from hydropower to municipal and industrial supply exceeded the Corps' authority, raising concerns about water reallocation at other facilities. The Corps reallocated storage space from Lake Lanier to M&I water providers without congressional approval, exceeding its authority. This has raised questions about water reallocation at other Corps reservoirs, with 44 reservoirs relying on the 1958 WSA for M&I storage authority. The Corps has reallocated water storage at its facilities, with 135 reservoirs holding 11 million acre-feet for M&I water. 44 reservoirs rely on the 1958 WSA for M&I storage authority, totaling less than 640,000 AF. Lake Texoma has seen over 50,000 AF reallocated for M&I use, with four reallocations performed. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, with four reallocations performed, totaling 103,003 AF. Reallocation from hydropower to M&I was approved in 1985 with compensation for lost hydropower negotiated among stakeholders. The Corps reallocated 84,099 AF from hydropower to M&I use at Lake Texoma in 1985 with compensation for lost hydropower negotiated among stakeholders. The transfer did not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes and did not require significant structural modifications, allowing it to be performed under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval. The Corps found that reallocating water from Lake Texoma in 1985 for M&I use did not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes. The transfer was done under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval, despite exceeding the agency's policy limit. The reallocation at Cowanesque Lake exceeded the 15% usable storage criterion, representing almost 30% of storage. The Corps exceeded its policy limit by reallocating water from Cowanesque Lake for water supply, representing almost 30% of storage. This reallocation was done under the Corps' discretionary authority in the 1958 WSA, mentioned in P.L. 99-88 and H.Rept. 99-236. The Corps reallocated water from Cowanesque Lake for water supply under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority, exceeding the policy limit. This was mentioned in P.L. 99-88 and H.Rept. 99-236. The 1958 WSA requires evaluation of potential effects on authorized purposes before recommending reallocation. The Corps must evaluate potential effects on authorized purposes before reallocating water for water supply. Concerns have been raised about the sufficiency of Corps evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations. The 2009 court order raised concerns about the Corps' evaluations of M&I reallocation effects on authorized purposes. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in the report due to unauthorized withdrawals. The 2009 court order raised concerns about unauthorized withdrawals at Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland. Many Corps dams have unknown unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses, with operations evolving over time. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply is controversial. The 2009 court order raised concerns about unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at Corps facilities. Many Corps dams have unknown unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses, with operations evolving over time. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply is controversial. The 2009 court order raised concerns about unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at Corps facilities, including the agency's most controversial provision of M&I water supply. Most Corps reallocations have taken place without national attention or litigation like Lake Lanier, either through the Corps' delegated authority or specific congressional legislative direction. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA generally met the Corps' criteria for implementing discretionary authority. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA generally met the Corps' criteria for implementing discretionary authority, with few exceptions. The use of discretionary authority for M&I reallocation at federal facilities is a growing policy issue, especially regarding multiple reallocations in a single basin. The use of discretionary authority for M&I reallocation at federal facilities is a growing policy issue. Key issues include how reallocations in a single basin are treated, the agency's discretion in making agreements with stakeholders, and handling unauthorized withdrawals. The policy issue of M&I reallocation at federal facilities involves decisions on treating reallocations in a single basin separately, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and handling unauthorized withdrawals. Decisions on reallocations may impact stakeholders like recreation interests and hydropower customers. The reallocation of M&I water at federal facilities raises questions about transition, stakeholder impacts, pricing, and broader water policy issues for Congress. The federal government faces questions regarding the appropriate role in municipal water supply, especially in light of potential climate change effects like extended drought. These issues are further complicated by differing opinions on water resource infrastructure operations and national interests. The federal government is grappling with the appropriate role in municipal water supply, particularly in the face of potential climate change impacts like extended drought. There are varying opinions on water resource infrastructure operations and national interests, making it challenging to enact any significant changes to federal facilities."
