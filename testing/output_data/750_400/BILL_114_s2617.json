The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners, as outlined in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312(a)) states that Congress found the National Academy of Sciences reviewed human spaceflight goals and published recommendations in a 2014 report. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed human spaceflight goals and published recommendations in a 2014 report titled \"Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration.\" The Committee on Human Spaceflight, consisting of leaders from various fields, concluded that multiple practical and aspirational reasons support human space exploration. The Committee on Human Spaceflight, comprised of leaders from different sectors, found various reasons supporting human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, inspiring citizens, scientific discovery, and human survival. They affirmed the importance of exploring Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight supports human space exploration for reasons like economic benefits, national security, inspiring citizens, scientific discovery, and human survival. They recommend Mars as the long-term goal and suggest sustainable steps and mission planning by NASA to achieve it. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommends Mars as the long-term goal for human space exploration, with NASA conducting sustainable steps and mission planning to place humans on the surface of Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommends Mars as the long-term goal for human space exploration, with NASA conducting sustainable steps and mission planning to place humans on the surface of Mars. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include a provision for human exploration of Mars, with a focus on extending human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA is directed to develop a strategy for achieving this goal. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include a provision for human exploration of Mars, with a focus on extending human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA is directed to develop a strategy for achieving this goal. The Administration must submit reports outlining a strategy to achieve human exploration of Mars through sustainable missions in cis-lunar space, utilizing specific capabilities provided under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. The Administration is required to develop a strategy for sustainable human exploration missions in cis-lunar space using the Space Launch System, Orion crew capsule, and other capabilities provided under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. This strategy should include an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space to enable missions to various destinations such as lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, the moons of Mars, and other points of interest. The Administrator is required to include in the strategy the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for missions to various destinations like lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, and other points of interest, as well as opportunities for collaboration with international partners. The condensed text chunk is: \n\nThe strategy includes the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for economic, scientific, and technological advances, collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies, and opportunities provided by the International Space Station (ISS). The opportunities provided by the International Space Station (ISS) for high priority scientific research and technological developments useful in expanding and sustaining a human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond. The International Space Station (ISS) supports scientific research and technological developments for expanding human presence in space. It includes exploration mission architectures for the Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System, comparing different approaches based on assessed factors. The curr_chunk discusses a comparison of architectures and approaches for missions involving the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System. Factors such as cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and international collaboration opportunities are considered in evaluating different approaches that may enable new markets and opportunities for the United States. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of certain architectures and approaches in enabling new markets and opportunities for United States private industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, leadership, and national security considerations. The curr_chunk highlights the significance of architectures and approaches in fostering opportunities for private industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, leadership, and national security considerations. It also emphasizes the flexibility of these architectures to adapt to evolving technologies, partners, priorities, and budget constraints. Measures for setting standards are also mentioned. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of setting standards for crew health and safety in space missions, including radiation exposure limits, urgent medical care, and other safety issues. The curr_chunk discusses crew health and safety measures, including radiation exposure limits, urgent medical care, and training needs for space missions. The curr_chunk provides details on crew training needs, prioritizing missions, and assessing recommendations for space missions. The curr_chunk outlines a plan for prioritizing missions and assessing recommendations for space missions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 requires the Administrator to incorporate recommendations into the strategy and provide technical information for potential stakeholders. An independent review with the National Academy of Sciences is also mandated. The Administrator must provide technical information for potential stakeholders and partners, and an independent review by the National Academy of Sciences is required for each interim report on the strategy. The National Academy of Sciences will review and provide feedback on each interim report regarding the strategy outlined by the Administrator, identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and making further recommendations. The National Academy of Sciences will review and provide feedback on interim reports, including agreed-upon matters, concerns, and further recommendations as deemed appropriate by the Academy. The Administrator will ensure timely review and comment. The National Academy of Sciences will review interim reports and provide further recommendations as appropriate. The Administrator will ensure timely review and comment. The Administrator must ensure timely review of interim reports to comply with requirements and incorporate comments from the National Academy of Sciences. Deadlines for interim reports are set at 90 days after enactment of the Act and every five years thereafter. The Administrator must submit interim reports on the strategy to the National Academy of Sciences within 90 days of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter. Final reports are due within one year. The Administrator must submit an interim report to the National Academy of Sciences within 90 days of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter. A final report on the strategy is due to Congress one year after the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter. The Administrator must submit a final report to Congress on the strategy every five years after the enactment of the Act, incorporating the National Academy of Sciences' response to the most recent interim report."
