Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases, allowing the Secretary to make grants to States for prevention and control efforts. The Secretary can make grants to States for the prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases, with a preference for states with a higher incidence or prevalence of these diseases. States are encouraged to collaborate with local health entities for program development. The Secretary can award grants to States for prevention and control programs related to West Nile Virus and arboviral diseases. Preference may be given to States with a substantial incidence or prevalence of these diseases or increased risk. Grant funds must be used for specified purposes. The grant funds awarded to States for prevention and control programs related to West Nile Virus and arboviral diseases must be used for developing and implementing community-based mosquito control plans and programs on medical entomology and arbovirology. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of community-based mosquito control plans and the development of programs on medical entomology and vector-borne diseases to support prevention efforts. Matching funds and limitations on supplanting are also mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses the need for training to develop a competent workforce for mosquito and vector-borne disease control programs. States must provide assurances for matching funds to be eligible for grants under this subsection. States must provide assurances for matching funds to be eligible for grants under this subsection, requiring non-Federal contributions of at least 50% of program costs. Non-Federal contributions for grants must be at least 50% of program costs, which can be in cash or in kind, including plant, equipment, or services. Federal contributions required under subparagraph (A) can be in cash or in kind, including plant, equipment, or services.

At least 85 percent of the grant amount must be spent at the local level for public health improvement related to West Nile Virus. Technical assistance is provided with appropriated funds. The grant requires at least 85 percent of the funding to be spent locally on public health improvement for West Nile Virus. Appropriated funds can be used for technical assistance to support mosquito control programs at the state and local levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can use funds to provide technical support for mosquito control programs and arboviral disease containment. Up to 20 percent of the allocated amount can be used for this purpose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can allocate funds for technical assistance, including developing mosquito abatement guidelines in consultation with health and mosquito control organizations. Up to 20 percent of the funds can be used for this purpose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in consultation with health and mosquito control organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local levels, focusing on identifying new human cases of disease and tracking the spread of disease through monitoring infection in various creatures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will develop guidelines for building the public health infrastructure, including programs to identify new human cases of disease, track disease spread through monitoring infection in various creatures, provide laboratory support, increase surveillance system participation, and conduct educational outreach campaigns to reduce exposure to arboviruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will develop guidelines for building the public health infrastructure, including programs to identify new human cases of disease, track disease spread, provide laboratory support, increase surveillance system participation, conduct educational outreach campaigns, and evaluate the established program. The Secretary will evaluate the mosquito control program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act and submit a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act, including the evaluation results and information on developing a sustainable mosquito abatement program for funded States.

The program shall terminate on September 30, 2004, with the possibility of extension based on evaluation. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section for an Arbovirus Research Program. The President is mandated to enhance research to control insect populations transmitting diseases like West Nile Virus, develop rapid screening tools, pathogen inactivation technologies, and containment methodologies. The President is required to enhance research to control insect populations transmitting diseases like West Nile Virus, develop rapid screening tools, pathogen inactivation technologies, and containment methodologies. Activities may include examining and developing new methodologies for controlling insect populations. Activities under subsection (a) may involve examining and developing methodologies to control insect populations for the spread of the West Nile Virus and related arboviruses. Entities involved in these activities may include the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration, among other relevant Federal Government entities.
