    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance, not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the authority to expand eligibility for children under 19 to any level they choose, regardless of income. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children. Under current statutory and regulatory authority, states can expand eligibility for children under 19 to any level they choose. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children by using the regular Medicaid federal matching rate for those with family incomes exceeding 300% of poverty, with exceptions for certain states. Medicaid federal matching rate (FMAP) is used for CHIP enrollees with family incomes over 300% of poverty, with exceptions for certain states like New Jersey and New York. States can assist qualifying children by covering them under Medicaid or creating a separate CHIP program. States can assist qualifying children by covering them under Medicaid or creating a separate CHIP program. Medicaid rules apply when providing coverage under Medicaid, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. Federal CHIP funding covers program costs. When states cover low-income children under separate CHIP programs, Title XXI rules apply, and federal CHIP funds cover program costs. Title XXI does not establish individual entitlement to benefits but provides states with federal allotments based on a distribution formula. Title XXI provides federal CHIP funds for program costs, with states receiving pre-determined allotments based on a distribution formula. Low-income children covered under CHIP-funded Medicaid expansions are entitled to benefits under Medicaid law. No individual entitlement exists for children covered under separate CHIP programs. States can expand Medicaid to cover targeted low-income children. Children covered under a CHIP-financed expansion of Medicaid are entitled to Medicaid benefits as per Medicaid law. Targeted low-income children in separate CHIP programs can be covered by states through Medicaid expansion, either by creating a new eligibility group or adjusting existing financial rules. Many states opt to cover these children under existing Medicaid pathways. States have the option to cover targeted low-income children under existing Medicaid pathways or through a separate CHIP program, reducing administrative burden. States can cover targeted low-income children through existing Medicaid pathways or a separate CHIP program, reducing administrative burden. Eligibility factors for separate CHIP programs include geography, age, income, resources, residency, and disability status. States can determine eligibility for separate CHIP programs based on factors such as geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers, providing health benefits coverage, including prenatal care and delivery services, to unborn children. States could also offer a \"family coverage option\" through a group health plan that may include maternity care. States could extend coverage to pregnant women through 1115 waivers or offer pregnancy-related services through CHIP state plan amendments. As of October 2007, 17 states provided pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds. In October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds. 6 states used the \u00a71115 waiver authority, and 12 states extended coverage to unborn children of adult pregnant women through unborn child SPAs. Tennessee was the only state that did not extend coverage to the unborn children of undocumented aliens. In FY2008, 364,161 unborn children were enrolled in CHIP, with nearly half in California. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to be met by states. In FY2008, 364,161 unborn children were enrolled in CHIP, with nearly half in California. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with specific eligibility criteria to be met by states. The upper income level for pregnant women under CHIP may be as high as the standard for CHIP children in the state, with no pre-existing conditions or waiting periods allowed. Coverage is provided during pregnancy through the postpartum period, with states able to temporarily enroll pregnant women for up to two months until eligibility is determined. The period of coverage for pregnant women under CHIP is from pregnancy through the postpartum period, with states allowed to temporarily enroll them for up to two months until eligibility is determined. Benefits include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one year. Benefits for pregnant women under CHIP include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one year, with eligibility potentially being redetermined at that point. States may also offer postpartum services for pregnant women through waivers. CHIPRA clarified that states can cover pregnant women and unborn children through waivers. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for five years, but coverage was allowed at state discretion after the five-year bar. Sponsor's income and resources are considered for legal immigrants in determining eligibility. CHIPRA clarified that legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for five years, but coverage was allowed at state discretion. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for legal immigrants in determining eligibility for federally means-tested programs. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States and are otherwise eligible. The sponsor's affidavit of support ensures the new immigrant will not become a public charge and holds the sponsor financially responsible. The CHIP state plan option is available to states that elect this option under Medicaid for pregnant women coverage. The provision allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States and are otherwise eligible. States can elect the CHIP state plan option under Medicaid for pregnant women coverage, ensuring that the cost of care will not be deemed against an individual's sponsor. The provision allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. States can elect the CHIP state plan option to provide assistance for pregnant women, ensuring that the cost of care will not be deemed against an individual's sponsor. Individuals eligible under this provision must show valid documentation of legal residence during redetermination processes. Under current law, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) broad authority to modify many aspects of the CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not otherwise eligible for CHIP. Certain states have covered adults with CHIP, and individuals made eligible under this provision must show valid documentation of legal residence during redetermination processes. Under current law, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify aspects of the CHIP program, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically covered. Some states have used waivers to cover adults with CHIP funds, with waivers initially lasting five years and subject to renewal every three years. Prior to 2007, waiver renewals for states covering adults were approved, even for those facing federal CHIP funding challenges. Certain states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, initially lasting five years and subject to renewal every three years. Before 2007, waiver renewals were approved even for states facing federal CHIP funding challenges. However, since 2007, some states have not had their waiver renewals approved or have started transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to certain populations. Since 2007, some states have not had their CHIP waiver renewals approved or have transitioned adult populations out of coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to extend coverage to certain populations. CHIPRA will end coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage. CHIPRA allows states to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to certain adult populations, with 7 states having authority to cover parent populations. Nonpregnant childless adults will lose CHIP coverage by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, with budget neutrality standards tied to previous fiscal year spending. CHIPRA allows states to extend coverage to certain adult populations using CHIP funds. States with existing waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, with budget neutrality standards tied to previous fiscal year spending. Starting in FY2012, allowable spending under waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment. Starting in FY2012, CHIPRA allows states with CHIP parent coverage waivers to spend a set-aside amount from a separate allotment, matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting benchmarks will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parent coverage. Waiver spending under the set-aside is prohibited for parents with family income exceeding eligibility limits. In FY2013, states meeting coverage benchmarks will receive funding between regular and enhanced FMAPs for parent coverage. CHIPRA prohibits waiver spending for parents with income exceeding eligibility limits. Additionally, CHIPRA includes provisions for access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, along with $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants. CHIPRA included provisions to facilitate access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, along with $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. 10% of the grants will be allocated to a national enrollment campaign, 10% for outreach to Native American children, and the remaining 80% for outreach campaigns in rural areas. CHIPRA included provisions for CHIP allotments from 2009 to 2013, with 10% allocated to a national enrollment campaign and 10% for Native American children outreach. The remaining 80% will go to state and local governments for outreach in rural and underserved areas, focusing on reducing barriers to enrollment. CHIPRA focuses on rural areas and underserved populations, targeting proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. It requires states to describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers and offers an option to use \"Express Lane\" agencies for enrollment facilitation. CHIPRA allows states to revise procedures for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment to reduce barriers. It also provides an option for states to use \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for children under 19. The CHIPRA provision allows states to streamline Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by using agencies like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, and Food Stamps to determine eligibility for children under 19. States can opt for automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility determination with family consent, and can rely on reported income from state tax records for eligibility determination. The CHIPRA provision allows states to streamline Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by using agencies like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, and Food Stamps to determine eligibility for children under 19. States can opt for automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility determination with family consent, and can rely on reported income from state tax records for eligibility determination. States have the option to inform families about potential lower premium payments or more comprehensive health coverage under Medicaid if income is directly evaluated by the state Medicaid agency. The requirement for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP application forms under penalty of perjury has been removed. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) required proof of citizenship and identity for citizens and nationals applying for Medicaid, replacing the previous self-declaration system. CHIPRA eliminated the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP application forms under penalty of perjury. The DRA of 2005 mandated proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants, replacing self-declaration. CHIPRA allowed the use of SSNs verified by SSA as an alternative for citizenship verification in Medicaid and added a similar requirement for CHIP. CHIPRA allows states to use Social Security Numbers (SSNs) verified by the SSA for citizenship verification in Medicaid and CHIP. It also adds a requirement for citizenship documentation in CHIP. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data. New Jersey has the highest upper income eligibility limit for children in CHIP at 350% of the FPL. Eleven states, the District of Columbia, four counties, and certain children up to age two in California are included. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data. New Jersey has the highest upper income eligibility limit for children in CHIP at 350% of the FPL. Eleven states, the District of Columbia, and certain children in California have CHIP coverage above 250% FPL. Twenty-two states have upper income limits at 200% FPL, while six states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL. CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million.

CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children in FY2008, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, which has been controversial. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, with 335,000 adults enrolled in FY2008, including parents, childless adults, and pregnant women. In FY2008, 335,000 adults were enrolled in CHIP, with most being parents. The number of adult enrollees decreased compared to previous years due to changes in coverage waivers. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota had more adult CHIP enrollees than children. In FY2008, the number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased compared to previous years due to changes in coverage waivers. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States have the option to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. States using Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services specified in their state Medicaid program. States have the option to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services specified in their state Medicaid program. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to enroll children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to enroll children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans, which are similar to separate CHIP programs. These plans offer nearly identical benefits to those available through the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) Program for children under age 21 in Medicaid eligibility groups. Children under age 21 in Medicaid eligibility groups receive benefits through benchmark-equivalent plans, similar to CHIP programs. The EPSDT Program provides well-child care, immunizations, and necessary medical services, including optional ones not typically covered by Medicaid. The EPSDT Program under CHIPRA mandates comprehensive healthcare coverage for children, including well-child care, immunizations, and necessary medical services. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs to ensure appropriate coverage for uninsured children. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs to ensure appropriate coverage for uninsured children: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit package options include the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option plan, health coverage available to state employees, or other approved health coverage. The benchmark benefit package for uninsured children can be one of three plans: the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option plan, health coverage available to state employees, or the largest commercial HMO in the state. Benchmark-equivalent coverage must have the same actuarial value as one of these benchmark benefit packages. States choosing this coverage must include all benefits. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for uninsured children must match the actuarial value of one of three benchmark benefit packages: Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, state employee health coverage, or the largest commercial HMO in the state. It should include basic benefits like hospital services, physician care, lab services, and well-child care, along with at least 75% of the actuarial value. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for uninsured children must include basic benefits such as hospital services, physician care, lab services, and well-child care. It should also cover at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, vision services, and hearing services. States are encouraged to cover other service categories, but abortions are not covered except in cases of rape. The curr_chunk discusses the coverage requirements for additional services in Benchmark-equivalent coverage for uninsured children under CHIP programs. It mentions that states are encouraged to cover other service categories beyond the basic benefits. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs, with different approaches to implementation. CHIP programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories cover abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. Different states use various approaches, including Medicaid expansions, separate state programs, or a combination of both. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse services coverage under CHIP. CHIPRA made changes to coverage of mental health and substance abuse services under CHIP, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. The law ensures that state CHIP plans must have financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health and substance abuse benefits that are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. There should be no separate cost-sharing or treatment limitations for mental health or substance abuse benefits. The CHIPRA law mandates that state CHIP plans must provide mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits without more restrictive financial requirements or treatment limitations than those for medical and surgical benefits. Dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive and restorative care for oral health. State CHIP plans must provide mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits without restrictive financial requirements. Dental services are now required under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restorative care, and treatment for emergency conditions. Dental benefits have always been required for CHIP Medicaid expansion children. States can offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages. The new law requires dental services for CHIP programs, including preventive care, restorative care, and treatment for emergency conditions. States can offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages modeled after other healthcare plans. Additionally, the law includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on the number of children receiving dental services. The new law mandates dental services for CHIP programs, including preventive and restorative care. States can provide dental services through benchmark packages. Provisions for dental education and services at health centers are included. States must report detailed information on children receiving dental care. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP. The federal Insure Kids Now website and hotline will provide information on dental providers and covered services for children. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for improving access. CHIPRA allowed CHIP funds to be used for premium assistance programs. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations for federal and state actions to address barriers to dental care, including the use of mid-level providers. CHIPRA allowed for dental-only supplemental coverage for children enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage. States can provide dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits. CHIPRA provided states with the option to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in employer-sponsored plans, meeting CHIP eligibility criteria. States can align this coverage with new dental benchmark benefits plans or CHIP cost-sharing protections, setting income eligibility levels up to those of their separate CHIP programs. States may offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children under CHIP, aligning with new dental benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections. Income eligibility levels can be set up to those of their separate CHIP programs, with certain conditions to be met. States must implement the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute as of January 1, 2009, without limiting acceptance of applications or imposing enrollment caps. Benefits must be provided to all eligible children in the state. Dental coverage for children under CHIP must be consistent, regardless of whether they have dental-only supplemental coverage. States have the option to not apply an eligibility waiting period. States must implement the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute without limiting applications or imposing caps. Dental coverage for children must be consistent, regardless of supplemental coverage. States have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. Under prior law, states could use CHIP funds to pay for group health insurance if cost-effective and not substituting for existing coverage. Premiums for employer-based plans had to meet CHIP minimum benefits and cost-sharing requirements, with children not having had group coverage for a specified period. Under CHIP, states could use funds for employer-based plan premiums if they met minimum benefits and cost-sharing requirements. Children must not have had group coverage for a specified period. Medicaid allows premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective. Under Medicaid, states can implement a premium assistance program for individuals enrolled in employer plans if it is cost-effective and comprehensive. This means that the employer plan must cover all Medicaid services not included in the private plan. The employer plan's costs are lower than providing Medicaid-covered services directly. States must offer \"wrap-around\" benefits to meet Medicaid requirements. Many struggle to meet all requirements, leading to waivers for CHIP and Medicaid premium assistance programs. CHIPRA introduced a new state plan option for premium assistance. Most states operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs under waivers to overcome prohibitive requirements. CHIPRA introduced a new state plan option for providing premium assistance, including outreach and enrollment assistance for eligible families. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents. The curr_chunk discusses the procedures for providing outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for families eligible for premium assistance subsidies under CHIP. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents if certain criteria are met regarding employer-sponsored insurance coverage. Under CHIPRA, states can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents if certain criteria are met regarding employer-sponsored insurance coverage. If the employer pays at least 40% of the total premium, the employer's group health plan qualifies as \"creditable coverage\" and is offered in a nondiscriminatory way. CHIP eligible individuals are not required to enroll in an employer's plan, and they can choose to enroll in regular CHIP instead of the premium assistance program. The subsidy will generally cover the difference in out-of-pocket costs for the worker. Under CHIPRA, states can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket costs for the worker, and individuals can choose to enroll in regular CHIP instead of the premium assistance program. No cost-effectiveness test is required for the child's coverage using premium assistance. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals. A separate test is established for family coverage, where the subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it is more cost-effective than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone. No cost-effectiveness test is required for the child's coverage using premium assistance. CHIPRA allows states to establish premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals, including a separate test for family coverage. If the cost of covering the entire family in an employer-sponsored plan is lower than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone, the subsidy can be used to pay the entire family's premium. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and can create an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for small employers with CHIP-eligible employees or family members. CHIPRA allows states to establish premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals, including a separate test for family coverage. States can create an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for small employers with CHIP-eligible employees or family members. The new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid, not CHIP, will apply to children enrolled in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. CHIPRA also amends Federal laws to streamline coordination between public and private coverage. The CHIPRA law allows states to establish premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals, including children in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. It amends Federal laws to streamline coordination between public and private coverage, making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by health insurance beneficiaries. The CHIPRA law allows states to establish premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals, including children in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. It streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by health insurance beneficiaries, including monthly premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.

Cost-sharing for health insurance beneficiaries may include monthly premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP, following nominal cost-sharing rules for targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Children who are 18 years old and enrolled in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may be subject to service-related cost-sharing at state option. DRA provided states with a new option for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for targeted low-income individuals. The DRA provided states with a new option for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for targeted low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. Children in families with income under 100% FPL are not allowed to have premiums and have limited service-related cost-sharing. For families with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums can be imposed, but service-related cost-sharing can be up to 10% of the cost. For children in families with income above 150% FPL, premiums are allowed with no specified limit, and cost-sharing can be up to 20% of the service cost. The total cost-sharing for all individuals cannot exceed 5% of family income quarterly. Cost-sharing for Medicaid recipients is limited to 10% of the cost of the item or service for those below 150% FPL, and up to 20% for those above. The total aggregate cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income on a quarterly or monthly basis. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing, and nominal amounts will be indexed by medical care inflation. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments for non-emergency care. States are allowed flexibility in implementing cost-sharing. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) allows states to impose cost-sharing for Medicaid recipients, limited to 10% for those below 150% FPL and up to 20% for those above. The total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income on a quarterly or monthly basis. Preventive services for children are exempt from DRA cost-sharing, and nominal amounts will be adjusted for medical care inflation. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments for non-emergency care. States have flexibility in implementing cost-sharing, including the ability to condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payments and allow providers to deny care for non-payment. Premiums or enrollment fees may be imposed for CHIP participation, with the maximum amount dependent on family income.

The maximum allowable amount of premiums for families with incomes under 150% FPL in separate state programs must comply with federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing for these families is limited to nominal amounts for those below 100% FPL and slightly higher amounts for those between 100%-150% FPL. Families with income above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing in any amount, ensuring that higher-income children are not charged less than lower-income children. Cost-sharing limits are defined for families based on income levels, with nominal amounts for those below 100% FPL and slightly higher amounts for those between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing in any amount, ensuring fairness between higher and lower-income children. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families regardless of income. States must inform families of these limits and provide a mechanism to stop payments once the limits are reached. Cost-sharing limits for CHIP families are based on income levels, with a 5% out-of-pocket limit for lower-income children. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once the limit is reached.

CHIPRA 2009 expanded data collection for CHIP and Medicaid. CHIPRA 2009 expanded data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, including developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. Reporting requirements were added to states' annual CHIP reports. The new law under CHIPRA 2009 directs the Secretary of HHS to develop child health quality measures and reporting formats for pediatric care under CHIP and Medicaid. Reporting requirements were added to states' annual CHIP reports, including data on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium assistance. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to care under Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, a new federal commission called the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission was established. The CHIPRA 2009 law directs the development of child health quality measures and reporting formats for pediatric care under CHIP and Medicaid. A study on children's access to primary and specialty care under Medicaid and CHIP will be conducted by GAO. A new federal commission, MACPAC, will review policies affecting children's access to benefits and provide recommendations for improving access and quality of care. Regular reports to Congress will detail findings and recommendations. The CHIPRA 2009 law established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review policies impacting children's access to benefits. MACPAC will provide recommendations for improving access and quality of care, with regular reports to Congress detailing findings. Additionally, the law requires the Secretary of HHS to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess access and quality of care for uninsured children. The CHIPRA 2009 law established MACPAC to review policies impacting children's access to benefits and quality of care. A federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans will assess access and quality of care for uninsured children, focusing on outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment, and retention factors. The federal evaluation of CHIP will assess outreach and enrollment strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment, and retention factors for uninsured children. Federal financing includes total appropriations, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and administrative caps. The federal financing of CHIP includes three main components: federal appropriations for states' annual allotments, reallocation of unspent funds, and other factors like matching rates and administrative caps. BBA 97 allocated around $40 billion for CHIP allotments from FY1998 to FY2007, with funding levels varying annually. Total annual appropriations ranged from over $4.2 billion for FY1998-FY2001 to under $3.2 billion for FY2002-FY2004. The funding for CHIP allotments varied annually from FY1998 to FY2007, with total appropriations ranging from over $4.2 billion to under $3.2 billion. There was a \"CHIP dip\" in funding for FY2002-FY2004 due to budget constraints, but funding increased to about $5.0 billion in FY2007. The funding for CHIP varied annually from FY1998 to FY2007, with appropriations ranging from over $4.2 billion to under $3.2 billion. The \"CHIP dip\" in funding for FY2002-FY2004 was due to budget constraints, but funding increased to about $5.0 billion in FY2007. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. In lieu of reauthorization, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds to provide CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009. Additional funds were also appropriated due to projected shortfalls in federal CHIP funds in certain states. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation. The SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009, with additional funds appropriated for states facing shortfalls. CHIPRA allocated $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013, with specific amounts for each fiscal year. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation of $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013, with specific amounts allocated for each fiscal year. The allotment among states is determined by a formula set in law, with territories receiving 0.25% prior to CHIPRA. The federal CHIP appropriation among states is determined by a formula set in law, with territories receiving 0.25% prior to CHIPRA. The remaining funds are divided among states based on the number of low-income uninsured children, adjusted by a geographic factor and limited by certain thresholds to ensure consistency in allotments. The CHIP allotments for states are determined by a formula using survey estimates of low-income uninsured children, adjusted by a geographic factor and limited by thresholds to ensure consistency. Each state's allotment is calculated individually, and if the total allotments do not exceed the national appropriation, that will be the state's allotment. The CHIP allotments are divided based on state survey estimates, with each state receiving an allotment if the total does not exceed the national appropriation. Allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with payments typically taken from the earliest active account. The federal CHIP allotments for states are available for two years starting from FY2009. Payments are drawn from the earliest active account until fully expended, then the state can access the next available allotment. The allotments are based on state-specific amounts calculated using growth factors. The federal CHIP allotments for states are available for two years starting from FY2009. Once the fiscal year allotment is fully expended, the state can draw from the next available allotment, which is determined by state-specific amounts calculated using growth factors. The federal CHIP allotments for states are determined by state-specific amounts calculated using growth factors and projections of federal spending. Allotments are available for two years starting from FY2009 and will be increased by 10% if the national appropriation is sufficient. For FY2010, the allotment will be calculated based on four amounts multiplied by the growth factor for the year. The allotment for states (or territories) for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2013 will be calculated based on specific amounts and growth factors, with adjustments made for prior year spending. In FY2009, allotments were redistributed and spent by shortfall states, along with funds provided in the first half of the year. For FY2011 and FY2013, state allotments will be \"rebased\" based on prior year spending. In FY2012, allotments will be calculated based on the previous year's allotment and any Contingency Fund spending. The state's growth factor for the year will be used to calculate the new base for spending, which is the prior year's federal CHIP spending. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. BBA 97 specified rules for redistribution of funds to states that qualified. At the end of the period, unspent allotments are redistributed to other states based on rules that vary by fiscal year. BBA 97 stated that states had to exhaust their allotment within three years to be eligible for unspent funds. The Secretary determined how funds would be redistributed to qualifying states. In FY2006, insufficient funds were available to cover projected federal CHIP shortfalls in 12 states, leading Congress to allocate an additional $283 million in DRA. Illinois and Massachusetts faced higher CHIP spending than expected, resulting in shortfalls. In FY2006, $283 million was allocated in DRA to cover CHIP shortfalls in 12 states. Illinois and Massachusetts had higher spending than anticipated, resulting in shortfalls totaling $100 million, mostly from Illinois. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent funds from FY2004 was available for redistribution. A bill was passed in the closing hours of the 109th Congress to specify how these funds would be redistributed. In FY2006, $283 million was allocated in DRA to cover CHIP shortfalls in 12 states, with Illinois and Massachusetts experiencing higher spending than anticipated. Shortfalls totaling approximately $100 million, mostly from Illinois, were reported. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 funds was available for redistribution, with a bill passed in the closing hours of the 109th Congress to specify the redistribution process. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 required the funds to be distributed to states based on their monthly funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 to delay any state facing a shortfall as far into the year as possible. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 (H.R. 6164, P.L. 109-482, NIHRA) aimed to delay state funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 by distributing funds based on monthly shortfalls. Projections suggested this provision would delay shortfalls until the end of March 2007. Additionally, the act allowed for the redistribution of up to half of unspent FY2005 funds by March 31, 2007, capped at $20 million per state. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 aimed to delay state funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 by redistributing unspent FY2005 funds, capped at $20 million per state. States had to meet specific criteria to forgo unspent funds, potentially providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 aimed to delay state funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 by redistributing unspent FY2005 funds. States had to meet specific criteria to forgo unspent funds, potentially providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states. This was projected to delay any state facing a shortfall of federal CHIP funds until May 2007. In May 2007, P.L. 110-28 was enacted to appropriate up to $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. Cumulative federal CHIP financing from 1998 to FY2007 is shown in Table 2. For FY2008, unspent FY2005 allotments were redistributed to shortfall states on a monthly basis. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 allotments to states with shortfalls and appropriated up to $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls. Actual funding provided totaled just under $1 billion. For FY2009, MMSEA also required redistribution of unspent FY2006 allotments to projected states. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 allotments and appropriated up to $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls. Actual funding provided totaled just under $1 billion. For FY2009, MMSEA required redistribution of unspent FY2006 allotments to states with projected shortfalls. Additionally, MMSEA appropriated up to $275 million for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. In FY2009, allotments were redistributed to states facing shortfalls before March 31, 2009, on a monthly basis. MMSEA appropriated up to $275 million for states' remaining shortfalls. The increased FY2009 allotments from CHIPRA should prevent federal funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. Any unspent funds would first go to shortfall states and then towards bonus payments. Additionally, a Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created under CHIPRA. CHIPRA should prevent federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009 by redistributing unspent funds to shortfall states and providing bonus payments. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was also created to prevent states from experiencing funding shortfalls, with direct payments available for CHIP children above a target enrollment level. The Contingency Fund was established as part of CHIPRA to prevent states from facing federal funding shortfalls for CHIP. It provides direct payments to states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level, with payments capped at 20% of the national allotment amount. This fund operates similarly to Medicaid, as it is a federal-state matching program where the federal government matches state spending for program expenses. The Contingency Fund for CHIP prevents funding shortfalls by providing direct payments to states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level. Payments are capped at 20% of the national allotment amount and are reduced proportionally if necessary. CHIP operates as a federal-state matching program, with the federal government matching state spending. The state's share of program spending for Medicaid is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), with the enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for CHIP reducing state expenditures by 30%. The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for CHIP reduces state expenditures by 30% compared to the regular FMAP for Medicaid. The E-FMAP ranges from 65% to 83.09% for CHIP, and all CHIP assistance for low-income children is eligible for this enhanced FMAP. Temporary Medicaid FMAP increases from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are not included in the calculation of E-FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is limited, with a 10% cap on state non-benefit expenses. The FMAP and enhanced CHIP FMAP have ceilings of 83% and 85%, with floors of 50% and 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is capped at 10% for state non-benefit expenses. This cap is tied to the amount a state draws down from its annual allotment for benefits and non-benefit costs under CHIP. No more than 10% of federal funds can be used for non-benefit costs. Under CHIPRA, federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities. The funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation. Under CHIPRA, federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities. The funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment and redistribution amounts. These funds can be used for non-benefit costs such as administrative expenses."
