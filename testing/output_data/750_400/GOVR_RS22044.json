Services can be provided on the premises of private schools, including parochial, elementary, and secondary schools, with statutory provisions for identifying children with disabilities applicable to those enrolled in private schools. Additional changes were made in the 2004 reauthorization to clarify these provisions. The 2004 reauthorization made further changes to ensure that children with disabilities in private schools, including parochial schools, receive special education services in a fair and equitable manner. These changes reflect current policy and clarify the responsibilities of Local Education Agencies (LEAs).

This has sparked controversy due to issues like disproportional effects on LEAs with many private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. One requirement is that funds expended by the LEA for parentally placed private school children must be proportionate to federal funds available under IDEA.

The issue of whether parents of a child with a disability are entitled to reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district is not addressed in the statute. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. upheld that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement, even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This ruling does not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unsettled. In Board of Education of the City School District of New York v. Tom F., the Court upheld an appeals court ruling that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement, even if the student never received special education services from the school district. The decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
