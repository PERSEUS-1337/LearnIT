The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for processing claims for veterans compensation and pension. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of claims processing, despite reported high accuracy rates. The Veterans Benefits Administration reported a 95 percent accuracy rate in processing claims in the past, but a new accuracy measurement system found that initial reviews were accurate only 64 percent of the time in 1998 and 2000. Adequate training for claims adjudicators is crucial as the administration could lose up to 30 percent of its workforce to retirement by 2003. In 2000, initial reviews of veterans claims were accurate only 64 percent of the time. The Veterans Benefits Administration could lose up to 30 percent of its workforce to retirement by 2003, emphasizing the need for adequate training for claims adjudicators. It is crucial for the administration to take more aggressive steps to ensure accurate and timely processing of veterans claims to avoid unnecessary delays in providing compensation and pension benefits. The Veterans Benefits Administration must improve processing of veterans claims to avoid delays in providing compensation and pension benefits. In 2001, the expected appeals processing time for a claim was 621 days, with a backlog of 533,029 claims as of September 2001. The Veterans Benefits Administration must improve processing of veterans claims to avoid delays in providing compensation and pension benefits. SEC. 3.
