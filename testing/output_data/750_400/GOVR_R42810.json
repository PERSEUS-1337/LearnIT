    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. This report provides information on the provisions of P.L. 112-154 by program, benefit, or topic. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) includes provisions from multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on specific criteria. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans, with eligibility based on specific criteria including veteran status, service-connected disabilities, income, and special treatment authority for certain groups of veterans. In 1981, Congress passed the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72), granting special authority to the VA to treat veterans for disorders related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide additional authority for the VA to offer healthcare to Persian Gulf War veterans for potential exposure-related medical conditions. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide healthcare for Persian Gulf War veterans with potential exposure-related medical conditions. P.L. 112-154 addressed the chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. P.L. 112-154 addressed the chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina by providing eligibility for VA health care services for certain veterans and their eligible family members stationed there from 1957 to 1987. The VA provides eligibility for health care services to veterans and their family members stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987 due to chemical exposure. Eligible individuals can receive medical care for fifteen specified illnesses or conditions. Veterans and their family members stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987 are eligible for medical care for fifteen specified illnesses or conditions, despite insufficient medical evidence to link these illnesses to military service during that period. The VA will cover medical expenses not covered by other health insurance plans for eligible family members. The VA provides medical care for specified illnesses for veterans and family members stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987. The VA will cover medical expenses not covered by other health insurance plans for eligible family members. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home and adult day health care facilities. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home and adult day health care facilities, with the VA providing grants and per diem for veterans' care. State laws govern management and admission criteria for these facilities. Under the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, the VA was required to pay for eligible family members' medical expenses not covered by other health insurance plans. State laws govern the management and admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes (SVHs), allowing each SVH to decide on admitting veterans. The VA was required to pay the full cost of care for veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 70% or more, or whose need for nursing home care was related to a service-connected condition, if they were receiving care in a VA facility or a contracted private nursing home. The VA was required to pay the full cost of care for veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 70% or more, or whose need for nursing home care was related to a service-connected condition, regardless of the care setting. This change was brought about by the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 equalized nursing home care costs for veterans, regardless of the setting. It allowed the VA to use higher per diem rates for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability in State Veterans Homes (SVHs), but these homes couldn't receive funding from other federal sources like Medicare or Medicaid. The VA was authorized to use higher per diem rates for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability in State Veterans Homes (SVHs) under P.L. 109-461. However, some SVHs reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. P.L. 112-154 now requires the VA to enter into contracts with SVHs to provide nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions. After implementing a new reimbursement methodology, some state veterans' nursing homes reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. Section 105 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA to contract with SVHs to provide nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions. The reimbursement methodology will be developed in consultation with SVHs, and the VA must replicate the previous reimbursement methodology upon request from any SVH. The VA must contract with state veterans' nursing homes to provide care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a disability rating of 70% or higher. The reimbursement methodology will be developed in consultation with SVHs, and the VA must replicate the previous methodology upon request. The Government Accountability Office found 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from 2007 to 2010. The Government Accountability Office found 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from 2007 to 2010, including various types of assaults. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General due to a lack of centralized reporting system. Section 106 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to establish a centralized management reporting system. The Government Accountability Office found 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from 2007 to 2010, including various types of assaults. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General due to a lack of centralized reporting system. Section 106 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to establish a comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at VA medical facilities. The VA is required to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, considering the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. Interim reports on policy development progress are also mandated. The VA is mandated to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, considering the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. Additionally, the VA must submit an interim report to Congress on the progress of developing this comprehensive policy within 30 days of enactment. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a significant issue for servicemembers in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) due to the increase in blast injuries. The enactment of P.L. 112-154 addresses the increase in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) among servicemembers in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) due to blast injuries from explosive devices. Factors contributing to the rise in TBIs include the prevalence of blast injuries, improved protective equipment, combat medicine, and air evacuation capabilities. The increase in blast injuries from explosive devices like IEDs, rocket-propelled grenades, and land mines has led to a rise in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) among servicemembers in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). Advances in protective equipment, combat medicine, and air evacuation have reduced fatalities from these injuries. Health care professionals are now more vigilant in diagnosing TBIs, although the total number of veterans with TBI remains unknown due to difficulties in identification and access to VA health care services. The total number of veterans with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) remains unknown due to difficulties in identification and access to VA health care services. Current law requires the VA to provide comprehensive care to veterans with TBI, but concerns have been raised about the interpretation of the statute limiting rehabilitative care for individuals with TBI. The VA is required by law to provide comprehensive care to veterans with TBI, including individualized rehabilitation plans. Concerns have been raised about the interpretation of the statute limiting rehabilitative care for individuals with TBI. Section 107 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize their independence and improve their behavioral and mental health functioning. This provision also requires the inclusion of rehabilitative services within the VA's comprehensive programs. The VA is mandated to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to enhance independence and improve mental health. Telemedicine is used for medical purposes when distance separates participants. Telemedicine and telehealth are utilized within the VA's long-term care programs for veterans with TBI in both VA and non-VA facilities. Telemedicine involves electronic communication for medical purposes, while telehealth supports long-distance clinical care, education, and health administration. Telehealth is a broader concept than telemedicine, involving the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient education, and health administration. It goes beyond medical encounters to include health education and related services. Telemental health involves using communication technology to provide behavioral health services, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and psychiatry, to patients remotely. Telemental health involves providing behavioral health services remotely using communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, psycho-educational interventions, cognitive testing, and general psychiatry. The Department of Defense refers to this as telebehavioral health, while the VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, providing mental health care to veterans in rural areas through telehealth activities. Research shows that telehealth offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective. Telehealth is used in delivering healthcare to veteran patients, especially those in rural areas. It has been shown to offer benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective. VA is required to carry out a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities unable to provide such assessments without contract or fee-basis care. Training opportunities are also mandated by VA. The VA is mandated to provide teleconsultation programs for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking the capability without contract or fee-basis care. Additionally, training opportunities in telemedicine are required for medical residents in VA facilities utilizing telemedicine. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to service-connected conditions. The VA provides training in telemedicine for medical residents in facilities with telemedicine capabilities. Veterans in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to service-connected conditions or illnesses. Veterans with 50% or more disability are exempt from copayments for any condition. Additionally, veterans are not charged copayments for certain outpatient services. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for any treatment, including nonservice-connected conditions. Additionally, veterans are not charged copayments for various outpatient services such as health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for any treatment, including nonservice-connected conditions. Outpatient services such as health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care are also provided without copayments. Veterans with no service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions may be required to pay copayments for primary care and specialty care visits. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are exempt from copayments for any treatment, including nonservice-connected conditions. For nonservice-connected conditions, veterans may have to pay copayments of $15 for primary care and $50 for specialty care visits. Veterans are only charged one outpatient copayment per day, even if they have multiple visits. VA can waive copayments for telehealth consultations. VA is authorized to provide service dogs to hearing or mobility-impaired veterans. The VA is authorized to waive copayments for telehealth consultations and provide service dogs to veterans with hearing, mobility, or mental health issues. Additionally, a research study was authorized to assess the benefits of these services. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 and National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 authorized the VA to provide service dogs for veterans with mental illnesses, including PTSD, and conduct research on the benefits of using service dogs for physical or mental injuries. Service dogs trained by accredited entities have access to VA facilities. The study assesses the benefits of using service dogs to treat veterans with injuries or disabilities, including PTSD. A service dog trained by an accredited entity may access VA facilities. Congress mandated the establishment of an Office of Rural Health to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. The Office of Rural Health (ORH) was established by Congress in 2006 to assist the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in collecting data on rural veterans and developing strategies to reduce disparities in service. The VA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) in FY2009 to create specialized practices and products for facilities nationwide. The Eastern Center is located in Togus, ME, with satellite offices in White River Junction, VT, and Gainesville, FL. The VHA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to assist in collecting data on rural veterans and reducing disparities in service. Three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) were opened in FY2009 to develop specialized practices and products for facilities nationwide. The Centers are located in Togus, ME, White River Junction, VT, Gainesville, FL, Iowa City, IA, and Salt Lake City, UT, serving as field-based clinical laboratories for new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 recognizes VRHRCs as satellite offices of the ORH. The Central and Western Centers in Iowa City, IA, and Salt Lake City, UT, respectively, serve as field-based clinical laboratories for new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 requires VRHRCs to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identify disparities in healthcare availability, formulate programs to enhance healthcare delivery, and develop special practices. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) authorized the VHA to bill for nonservice-connected care, aiming to improve healthcare delivery for veterans in rural areas. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) allowed the VHA to bill for nonservice-connected care to help cover the cost of medical services for veterans. However, it did not grant the VA the authority to keep the third-party payments collected. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) granted the VHA the authority to retain third-party payments for nonservice-connected care in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF), allowing the VA to use these funds to provide medical services for veterans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. The Act also authorized the VA to change its billing basis from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allowed the VA to retain third-party payments in the MCCF for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. It also authorized the VA to change its billing basis to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. In FY2004, the Administration requested the consolidation of medical collections accounts into one MCCF. In FY2004, the Administration requested the consolidation of various medical collections accounts into one MCCF, as recommended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. This included funds from the Health Services Improvement Fund, Veterans Extended Care Revolving Fund, Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund, Medical Facilities Revolving Fund, and Parking Revolving Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 provided the VA with permanent authority to deposit collections into the MCCF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 authorized the VA to deposit funds from various accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. The funds can be spent in any fiscal year and are available until expended. VA is required to develop a plan for identifying and collecting billable third-party payments. The VA has permanent authority to deposit funds from five accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. Section 111 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA to develop a plan for identifying and collecting billable third-party revenue for deposit into the MCCF, including effective processes and training for employees. The VA is required to develop a plan for identifying and collecting billable third-party revenue to be deposited in the MCCF. The plan must include effective processes, training for employees, fee revenue goals, and a monitoring system to ensure compliance. Additionally, the VA provides beneficiary travel payments to eligible veterans and family caregivers traveling to and from VA medical centers. The VA is required to develop a plan for billing and collecting funds for compliance. Fee revenue goals are set for the VA, along with an effective monitoring system. Currently, beneficiary travel payments are provided to eligible veterans and family caregivers. Section 104 of P.L. 112-154 mandates a three-year initiative to assess treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for travel reimbursement. This authority is limited to veterans in highly rural areas. The VA is required to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. This initiative will last for three years, with the VA Secretary issuing a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment. The VA is authorized to provide eligible veterans and beneficiaries with mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for travel to and from VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in cases of medical emergency. A report to Congress on the initiative's beneficiaries and analysis is due within 180 days of enactment. The VA provides reimbursement for ambulance and common carrier transport for eligible veterans and beneficiaries when traveling to and from VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required, except in cases of medical emergency. VA addressed overpayment issues for ambulance services in its FY2012 budget submission to Congress. In its FY2012 budget submission to Congress, VA proposed using local prevailing Medicare ambulance rates to reimburse providers, resulting in cost savings. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 gave VA the authority to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the prevailing Medicare rate for ambulance services. The VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement in its FY2012 budget submission to Congress, aiming for cost savings. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 granted VA the authority to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services. However, the change in law did not have the desired effect as it only applied when VA pays for ambulance service before determining the veteran's eligibility. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged by ambulance providers or the Medicare rate. However, this change did not have the desired effect as it only applied when VA pays for ambulance service before determining the veteran's eligibility. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 makes a technical correction to authorize VA to reimburse ambulance providers. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to reimburse ambulance providers for authorized ambulance transportation at the lesser of the actual charge or the local prevailing Medicare ambulance rate when VA has not entered into a contract with the provider. The new reimbursement methodology will apply in such cases. The VA is authorized to reimburse ambulance providers for authorized transportation at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. The new reimbursement method applies to all situations except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. The new reimbursement methodology for ambulance transportation applies to all situations except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. Means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions was established by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for health care and copayments. VA can use household income per Section 705 of P.L. 112-154. The VA uses veterans' household income from the most recent year to determine eligibility for health care and copayments. P.L. 112-154 also makes changes to the Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans with service-connected disabilities. P.L. 112-154 amends the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabilities, providing grants for home purchase or remodeling. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for veterans with mobility impairments and another for active duty servicemembers. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers two grant programs for veterans and active duty servicemembers. The first grant is for veterans with mobility impairments, while the second grant aids veterans who are blind or have lost the use of their hands. The dollar limit for the first grant is higher than for the second grant, and both types of grants are available to veterans. The Special Housing Adaptation Grant (\u00a72101(b) grant) aids veterans who are blind or have lost the use of their hands. It can also be used to adapt the home of a family member where a veteran is living indefinitely. The dollar limit for this grant is lower than for the \u00a72101(a) grant, which is available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands the qualifying disabilities for the \u00a72101(a) grant to include veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion, requiring aids for ambulation. Housing grants are available to veterans with severe burn injuries, as well as those who have lost the use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion. The eligibility criteria have been updated to include veterans or servicemembers who meet specific disability requirements, such as blindness with a visual acuity of 20/200 in the better eye with corrective lenses. Section 203 of P.L. 112-154 updates the measure of blindness to 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lenses. Section 204 increases the maximum assistance for grants to $63,780. The VA visual impairment standard for disability compensation has been changed to 20/200 vision with corrective lenses as part of the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. The maximum assistance for grants has been increased to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) grants and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b) grants under P.L. 112-154. The VA Secretary is required to adjust the award limits annually based on a cost-of-construction index. The new law, P.L. 112-154, increases the maximum assistance for grants to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) grants and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b) grants. The VA Secretary must adjust the award limits annually based on a cost-of-construction index. Veterans can use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily, known as the Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant. The new law, P.L. 112-154, increases the maximum \u00a72101(a) grant to $63,780 and the \u00a72101(b) grant to $12,756. Veterans can also use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily, known as the Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant. Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum TRA grants to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b). The TRA grant under P.L. 112-154 has increased the maximum grant amounts to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b), with higher limits now in effect. The grants will also be subject to annual adjustments using a cost-of-construction index and the authority for TRA grants has been extended to December 31, 2022. The TRA grants have been increased using the cost-of-construction index, with the authority extended to December 31, 2022. The SAH law limits grant funding for adaptations to a veteran's or servicemember's home, except in cases of substantial damage from a disaster. The SAH law limits grant funding for home adaptations, but allows exceptions for homes substantially damaged in disasters. Disabled veterans or servicemembers can receive funds to acquire another suitable home, with assistance not counting towards their maximum benefit. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows disabled veterans or servicemembers to receive funds to acquire another suitable home if their damaged home was being used and occupied. The assistance provided does not count towards their maximum benefit and is capped at the cost to repair or replace the property exceeding insurance coverage. The VA Loan Guaranty Program is a mortgage insurance program for eligible veterans. The VA Loan Guaranty Program is a mortgage insurance program for eligible veterans, where the VA guarantees a portion of losses to lenders in case of borrower default. The maximum benefit is set at the cost to repair or replace the property exceeding insurance coverage or statutory grant maximums. Unlike FHA, VA only guarantees a portion of the loan amount. The VA Loan Guaranty Program allows veterans to enter into mortgages with private lenders, with the VA guaranteeing a portion of losses in case of borrower default. The amount of guarantee varies depending on the loan amount. Veterans must occupy the property as their home to be eligible. Fees are based on factors like down payment amount, military service status, and whether it's the first time accessing the guaranty. Fees may be waived for certain circumstances. To be eligible for the VA loan guaranty, veterans must occupy the property as their home. Fees are based on factors like down payment amount, military service status, and whether it's the first time accessing the guaranty. Fees may be waived for certain circumstances, including veterans receiving compensation for a service-connected disability and surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation. Section 206 of P.L. 112-154 expands VA loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. Previously, only surviving spouses of veterans who died from their service-connected disabilities were eligible. The disability must meet specific duration requirements. The VA loan guaranty eligibility now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. The disability must meet specific duration requirements. The VA loan guaranty eligibility now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. The disability must meet specific duration requirements, such as being continuously rated totally disabling for a certain period before death. Surviving spouses who qualify for the loan guaranty based on this provision will not be required to pay the guaranteed loan fee. Section 207 of P.L. 112-154 expands housing occupancy requirements for VA loan guaranty eligibility. Veterans called away for active duty can have their spouses or dependent children occupy the property as a home. Sections 208 and 209 of P.L. 112-154 make adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage programs permanent. P.L. 112-154 expands VA loan guaranty eligibility by allowing dependent children of veterans called away for active duty to satisfy the occupancy requirement. It also makes adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage programs permanent. Additionally, it modifies the law regarding loan guaranty fee waivers for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The VA began guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages under P.L. 102-547 in 1992. P.L. 112-154 modified the law for veterans with service-connected disabilities to waive the loan guaranty fee based on pre-discharge examination or review of medical evidence. This change aims to reduce wait times for disability determinations. The new law allows disability compensation eligibility based on pre-discharge examination or review of medical evidence to avoid long waits. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 addresses loan fees, maximum guaranty amount, and loan sales securities for veterans. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 extends current loan fees for dwelling units until October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher maximum loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas. The loan fees for loans to purchase or construct dwelling units have been extended until October 1, 2017. Additionally, higher maximum loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas have been reinstated. The VA guaranty limit was previously based on the Freddie Mac statute, setting the conforming loan limit at $417,000. However, it could go up to 115% of the area median home price, not exceeding 150% of the conforming loan limit. Temporary increases were made in 2011 and 2014 through P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154, setting the maximum guaranty amount at 25% of the higher of the conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price. The VA guaranty limit was increased through P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154, allowing for a maximum guaranty amount of 25% of the higher of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding 175% of $625,500 or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas. These higher limits will be in effect until December 31. The VA can guarantee loans up to a maximum of 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016, allowing the VA to enter into direct loans when selling acquired property after veteran default on a mortgage. Prior to P.L. 112-154, the VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for VA mission enhancement. Lessees provided housing for homeless veterans, but EULs were also used for non-housing purposes. Fair consideration was charged for the lease, including in-kind payments and facility improvements. The VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for VA mission enhancement, charging \"fair consideration\" for the lease. EULs were used for housing homeless veterans and non-housing purposes, such as child development centers, parking facilities, golf courses, senior housing, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Section 211 of P.L. 112-154 now limits EUL properties to be used for \"supportive housing\" only. The VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process for various purposes, including child development centers, parking facilities, golf courses, senior housing, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. However, under Section 211 of P.L. 112-154, EUL properties can now only be used for \"supportive housing,\" defined as housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process now limits properties to be used only for \"supportive housing,\" which includes housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws, consideration for an EUL must be \"cash at fair value,\" and the VA must release a yearly report on consideration received. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process now limits properties to be used only for \"supportive housing,\" which includes housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws, consideration for an EUL must be \"cash at fair value,\" and the VA must release a yearly report on consideration received. Additionally, the Grant and Per Diem program authorizes the VA to make grants for services provided by public entities or private nonprofit organizations. The first annual report on consideration received for EULs should address recommendations from a VA Inspector General's report. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes the VA to make grants for services and transitional housing for homeless veterans. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes grants for services and transitional housing for homeless veterans, providing capital grants for facilities and reimbursing costs for housing and supportive services. Grantees are reimbursed up to the current per diem rate of $38.90 per day, with the option to use grants for construction of service centers. The Grant and Per Diem program reimburses grant recipients for providing housing and supportive services to homeless veterans at a per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Grants can also be used for construction of service centers and transitional housing, and grantees can utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits in conjunction with VA funding. The Grant and Per Diem program allows grantees to use Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for construction of service centers and transitional housing. P.L. 112-154 specifies that funds from other sources can be used as long as the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization, which now includes for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with a nonprofit as the sole general partner or manager. The VA Grant and Per Diem program authorizes $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, targeting homeless veterans. Ownership structure for LIHTC-financed developments includes for-profit limited partnerships with a nonprofit as the sole general partner or manager.
