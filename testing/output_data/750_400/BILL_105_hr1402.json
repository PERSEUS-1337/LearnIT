The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving process efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies, but Federal use lags behind industry. Probabilistic methods offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly outcomes. Probabilistic methods, if integrated into federally funded design efforts, could enhance understanding of product specifications, reduce overdesign, and lower associated costs. Probabilistic methods, if integrated into federally funded design efforts, could lead to a better understanding of product specifications, reduce overdesign, and lower associated costs in transportation systems. The integration of probabilistic methods in federally funded design efforts could improve the reliability and cost-effectiveness of transportation systems, benefiting various federal agencies. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve the reliability and cost-effectiveness of transportation systems. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify how these methods can benefit the Department of Transportation, assess their potential for maximizing ROI and enhancing public safety, evaluate the technology, recommend practical techniques, and create models for quantifying uncertainties in major transportation programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods aims to evaluate technology, recommend practical techniques, establish models for quantifying uncertainties in transportation programs, identify key technology areas for development, recommend implementation guidelines, and set reliability levels for public safety and industry. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods aims to evaluate technology, recommend practical techniques, establish models for quantifying uncertainties in transportation programs, identify key technology areas for development, recommend implementation guidelines, and set reliability levels for public safety and industry. Recommendations include guidelines for safety tests, creating required databases, expediting technology transfer, and ensuring appropriate use of probabilistic methods in decision-making involving funds. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods recommends guidelines for safety tests, creating databases, expediting technology transfer, identifying barriers to effective use of probabilistic methods, and making recommendations for their use in Department of Transportation programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods, under the Department of Transportation, identifies legal and cultural barriers to effective use of probabilistic methods, makes recommendations for their use in programs, institutionalizes values, and recommends pilot projects for evaluation of technology. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, and a representative from the Department of Defense appointed by the Secretary of Defense. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, and specific departments such as Defense, Commerce, and National Institutes of Health.
