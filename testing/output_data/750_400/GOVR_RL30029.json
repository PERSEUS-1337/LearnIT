    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa started expanding their settlement area 2,500-5,000 years ago from a base in present-day Nigeria or Cameroon. Around 2,500-5,000 years ago, the Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement area from present-day Nigeria or Cameroon, eventually becoming the predominant population in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are also found in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, possibly originating in the Nile valley. The Bantu people expanded from West Africa, becoming the predominant population in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are also present in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, possibly originating in the Nile valley. The term \"Nilotic\" to describe people today is no longer favored due to extensive intermingling with Bantu speakers. The Mediterranean climate of extreme southern Africa was not suitable for Bantu tropical agriculture, leading to the continued inhabitation by the \"Khoisan\" or \"San\" people. By 500 BC, the Bantu people had mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion in Africa. European explorers in the 15th century found a variety of crops being grown by African farmers. By 500 BC, the Bantu people had mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion in Africa. European explorers in the 15th century found African farmers growing a variety of crops, including some from the Indian Ocean region and southeast Asia. African farmers grew a variety of crops, including grains and unfamiliar foods like bananas. They also had cattle, but the tsetse fly limited cattle farming in certain regions. After the discovery of America, they adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, with some pastoral communities in dry regions like Kenya's Rift Valley. After the discovery of America, African farmers quickly adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, with some pastoral communities in dry regions like Kenya's Rift Valley. Large towns and cities had not developed in Africa due to the risk of diseases that had evolved with humans on the continent. Large towns and cities had not developed in Africa due to the risk of diseases that had evolved with humans on the continent. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent in pre-colonial Africa. Broadly similar languages were spoken over wide areas. In pre-colonial Africa, large towns and cities did not develop due to disease risks. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were absent, with African loyalties embedded in extended families and patron-client relationships. Similar languages were spoken over wide areas, possibly correlating with cultural practices and religious beliefs. In pre-colonial Africa, loyalties were embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships. Powerful individuals or chiefs, known as \"big men,\" emerged and consolidated authority in African kingdoms through marriage ties and control over trade routes. In pre-colonial Africa, powerful individuals or chiefs known as \"big men\" consolidated authority in African kingdoms through marriage ties, control over trade routes, and alliances. The Kongo kingdom, for example, was ruled by a powerful king who governed several provinces through royal relatives. Great artistic achievements also characterized many pre-colonial kingdoms. The chiefs consolidated their authority through conquest and alliance in pre-colonial Africa. European explorers encountered the Kongo kingdom to the south of the Congo River estuary, where a powerful king ruled several provinces through royal relatives. Great artistic achievements were evident in pre-colonial kingdoms, such as the naturalistic bronze castings in the kingdom of Benin and the stylized Congolese masks that inspired modern artists like Picasso. The Atlantic slave trade is believed to have started in 1441 when a man and a woman were captured on the coast of Western Sahara and taken to Portugal. Over the 400 years of the trade, between 10 million and 13 million people were enslaved. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441 when a man and a woman were captured on the coast of Western Sahara and taken to Portugal. Over the 400 years of the trade, between 10 million and 13 million people were taken from Africa, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak of the trade occurred in the eighteenth century. During the years of the Atlantic slave trade, between 10 million and 13 million people were taken from Africa, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak of the trade occurred in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000 in some years. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the slave trade, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting more than 1,600 ships off Africa's coast over the next 60 years. In the late 18th century, annual totals of slaves reached 100,000 as plantation agriculture expanded in the Americas. The British parliament voted to end the slave trade in 1807, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. Despite efforts to stop the trade, many ships evaded patrols, and slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. The British intercepted over 1,600 ships off Africa's coasts, freeing 160,000 captives and sending most to Sierra Leone. Despite efforts to stop the trade, many ships evaded patrols, and slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. U.S. participation in the slave trade was banned by legislation in 1807 and strengthened in 1819. European traders conducted the Atlantic slave trade by purchasing slaves from African owners with goods like guns, alcohol, and cloth. The Atlantic slave trade was conducted by European traders based on the West African coast, purchasing slaves with goods like guns, alcohol, and cloth. Slavery in Africa was practiced by enslaving captured people from wars, criminals, adulterers, and enemies of the king. The Atlantic slave trade involved European traders exchanging goods for slaves on the West African coast. Slavery in Africa included capturing people from wars, criminals, adulterers, and enemies of the king. Some slaves were kidnapped victims, and in traditional African societies, slaves were often absorbed into families or local armies with less harsh treatment than in the New World plantations. The Atlantic slave trade involved European traders exchanging goods for slaves on the West African coast. Many of those sold into the trade were kidnapped victims. In traditional African societies, slaves were often absorbed into families or local armies with less harsh treatment than in the New World plantations. The effects of the slave trade on African societies included turmoil, outbreaks of war, and instability fueled by the exchange of guns for slaves. The slave trade in Africa led to turmoil, war, and instability fueled by the exchange of guns for slaves. This warfare, loss of millions of people, and psychological damage weakened Africa, making it vulnerable to European colonization. The slave trade in Africa led to turmoil, war, and instability, weakening the continent and making it vulnerable to European colonization. As late as 1870, European powers were preparing to partition Africa among themselves, instead of indigenous political entities consolidating their authority. The kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa had a strong central government, advanced infrastructure, and was wealthy from gold and the slave trade. Buganda in East Africa was a powerful naval force on Lake Victoria with a strong king. The kingdom of Ashanti (Asante) had profited from its wealth in gold and the slave trade, had a strong central government, advanced infrastructure, and a national language. Buganda in East Africa was known for its powerful king, the Kabaka, its strong army, and growing trade. Several \"secondary empires\" were emerging, relying on European military technology, many based in Muslim societies, promoting the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. In East Africa, Buganda was known for its powerful king, the Kabaka, strong army, and growing trade. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were emerging in Muslim societies, promoting Islam's spread in sub-Saharan Africa. Islam had been slowly spreading in West Africa through trade contacts and had made larger gains in northeastern Africa through trade and Arab immigration. Africans willingly converted to associate with the wider Islamic world, with Koranic schools introducing Arabic literacy across the Sahel. In the nineteenth century, holy wars or jihads led to the creation of a vast West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria. Meanwhile, in East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar were expanding their power on the mainland, and Egypt was extending its control in northeastern Africa, with troops on Lake Victoria by 1876. In the nineteenth century, holy wars or jihads led to the creation of a vast West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar extended their power on the mainland, and Egypt expanded its control in northeastern Africa, with troops on Lake Victoria by 1876. In southern Africa, the \"Boers\" or Afrikaners, descended from Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, established a conservative Christian empire. By 1876, the Boers, practicing a conservative form of Christianity, had established an empire in southern Africa by defeating the powerful Zulu with modern rifles and cavalry tactics. They trekked deep into the African interior to escape British cultural influences. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Boers migrated into the African interior to avoid British influence. They defeated the Zulu using modern weapons and established farms in depopulated areas. The European scramble for Africa began in the 1870s, disrupting indigenous political entities. The European scramble for Africa in the 1870s disrupted indigenous political entities, leading to European control over sub-Saharan Africa by 1920, except for Ethiopia and Liberia. Ethiopia resisted Italian colonization by defeating Italian troops. The European scramble for Africa concluded in 1920, with British forces ending the last resistance in Somalia. By then, all of sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control. Ethiopia defeated Italian troops at Adowa in 1896 but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Italy invaded Ethiopia again in 1935 but was driven out by British troops in 1941-1942. In 1896, Ethiopian emperor Menelik II suffered a humiliating defeat against Italian troops at Adowa. Despite this, the Italians were not ousted from their colony in Eritrea along the Red Sea coast. The European scramble for Africa was aided by advances in medicine and military technology, giving them significant advantages over African forces. The European scramble for Africa in the late 19th century was facilitated by advances in medicine and military technology, giving Europeans a significant advantage over African forces. This led to many Africans choosing not to resist colonial invasion, although some groups like the Ashanti, Zulu, Boers, Herero, and peoples in French West Africa did resist. In 1898, British and Egyptian troops killed 10,800 Sudanese in one day of fighting, with minimal casualties on their side. Despite Europe's military advantages, some African groups like the Ashanti, Zulu, Boers, Herero, and peoples in French West Africa resisted colonial invasion. European leaders initially hesitated to seize African territory due to doubts about financial gains balancing the costs, but imperialists and nationalists pushed for expansion. In British, French, and German territories in Africa, armed struggles against colonizers were launched by local peoples. European leaders were initially hesitant to colonize Africa due to financial concerns, but pressure from imperialists, nationalists, anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests eventually led to expansion. The expansion of colonial powers in Africa was driven by various factors, including pressure from imperialists, nationalists, anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests. The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley and gold in the Witwatersrand region further fueled this expansion. British troops eventually subdued the Afrikaners in the second Boer War in 1902. Diamonds were discovered at Kimberley in 1871, and gold was found on the Witwatersrand in 1885. The new colonial powers valued Africa's agricultural potential, with Germany seeking raw cotton in Tanganyika. King Leopold II of Belgium hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns. At the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885, King Leopold II of Belgium successfully hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns, building an empire in the Congo River basin through treaties with local chiefs. M. Stanley, the British-American explorer, Leopold built a vast empire in the Congo River basin by funding exploration and persuading local chiefs to sign treaties at the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885. Leopold's International Association of the Congo (IAC) gained recognition, supported by Britain and Germany to counter French influence in Africa. Leopold also secured endorsement from U.S. President Chester Arthur. The Berlin conference established rules for acquiring colonies in Africa, requiring effective control before claiming territory, limiting colonization to major powers like Britain, France, and Leopold's International Association of the Congo (IAC), supported by Britain, Germany, and U.S. President Chester Arthur. The Berlin conference set rules for acquiring colonies in Africa, limiting colonization to major powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal secured territories in Angola and Mozambique, while Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa with colonies stretching from southern Africa to Egypt. Germany lost its colonies in World War I. Portugal secured territories in Angola and Mozambique, while Germany lost its colonies in World War I. Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa, holding colonies from southern Africa to Egypt, including the Gold Coast and Nigeria. France also held large territories in West and Central Africa. The United States did not have colonies in Africa but assisted in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The United States did not have colonies in Africa, but the U.S. Navy assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The settlers declared independence as the Republic of Liberia in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples and expand their control into the hinterland. The first permanent settlement on the West African coast was achieved in 1822 after struggles with disease and unfriendly local warriors. The settlers declared independence as the Republic of Liberia in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples, leading to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. In 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the Americo-Liberian president, William Tolbert, sparking a decade of unrest. The colonial era in Liberia led to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century, with indigenous soldiers killing the Americo-Liberian president in 1980, sparking a decade of unrest and a 6-year civil war. The effects of colonialism on Africa and its people are a subject of scholarly debate, with Leopold's rule in the Congo colony having clearly negative consequences. The colonial era in Liberia led to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century, with indigenous soldiers killing the Americo-Liberian president, William Tolbert, sparking a decade of political violence and human rights violations, followed by a 6-year civil war. The effects of Leopold's rule in the Congo colony were clearly negative, with widespread abuses such as forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation used as a policy instrument. The abuses in Congo under Leopold's rule were exposed by human rights activists and missionaries, leading to international scandal and reforms in 1908. Joseph Conrad's novel, The Heart of Darkness, highlighted the forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation used as policy instruments in the colony. The colonial era in Congo led to international scandal and reforms in 1908, with infrastructure improvements and public health standards in British and French-controlled territories. Christian missions promoted education and literacy. During the colonial era, infrastructure like roads and telephone systems were developed, benefiting towns and cities more than rural areas. Public health standards improved, and some elementary education was provided. Christian missions played a significant role in promoting education and literacy, leading to millions of converts. Limited opportunities for higher education, travel, and employment in the modern sector empowered some Africans who later became leaders in independent Africa, such as Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah. European investment in Africa was limited during the colonial era, with colonial governments expecting African colonies to fund their own development. Despite limited opportunities, some Africans were able to pursue higher education and travel, becoming leaders in independent Africa. Notably, figures like Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and Nnamdi Azikiwe studied abroad and later became presidents of their respective countries. European investment in Africa was limited during the colonial era, with colonial governments expecting African colonies to fund their own development. This led to the colonial state heavily influencing the economy, regulating prices, and determining crop choices. Post-independence, many countries retained these statist systems, hindering the development of market economies and creating a dependency on primary product exports. The colonial state heavily influenced the economy by regulating prices, determining crop choices, and promoting dependency on primary product exports. Post-independence, many countries retained these statist systems, hindering market economy development and creating economic problems in Africa. Colonial governments did not prioritize democracy or democratic traditions. The colonial state in Africa heavily influenced the economy by regulating prices and promoting dependency on primary product exports. Colonial governments had no interest in promoting democracy, as they aimed to rule Africa with minimal expenditure. Pressure for political rights and independence increased post-World War II, leading to imprisonment of dissenters by colonial regimes. The colonial state in Africa was authoritarian and not focused on democracy. Post-World War II, pressure for political rights increased, leading to imprisonment of critics by colonial regimes. Africans had limited political participation until the end of the colonial period when elections began. During the colonial period in Africa, critics were imprisoned and authoritarian measures were taken by colonial regimes, setting precedents for post-colonial rulers. Political participation was limited until the end of colonial rule when elections started. Britain and France worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues, contributing to the strengthening of traditional authorities. During the colonial era, colonial authorities worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation contributed to the strengthening of traditional authorities, leading to issues of corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Scholars believe colonial practices also intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. The colonial authorities in Africa contributed to corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Scholars believe colonial practices intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. Europeans viewed the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" encouraging Africans to do the same. Colonial authorities found it convenient to rule indirectly through \"tribal chiefs,\" whom they strengthened and sometimes created. The colonial era encouraged Africans to view the world in terms of tribes and nations, leading to the strengthening of tribal loyalties. This division based on ethnicity continues to fuel violent politics in Africa today. The colonial era strengthened tribal loyalties in Africa, leading to ethnic divisions that fuel violent politics today. Colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, weakening political institutions and economies. Roads and railroads were built to connect colonial capitals. The colonial partition of Africa imposed artificial boundaries, weakening political institutions and economies. Roads and railroads were built to connect colonial capitals, creating transport difficulties between African countries that persist today. Europeans suppressed indigenous political arrangements, leading to political instability and economic challenges. The colonial partition of Africa imposed artificial boundaries, weakening political institutions and economies. Roads and railroads were built to connect colonial capitals to their hinterlands, creating transport difficulties between African countries that persist today. Europeans suppressed indigenous political arrangements, leading to political instability and economic challenges. The fact that Africa's pre-colonial political entities were denied the opportunity to develop further is seen as the \"black man's burden\" by historian Basil Davidson. The end of colonialism in Africa was hastened by World War II, which weakened Britain and France. The war promoted ideas of democracy and resistance to aggression, resonating with Africa's emerging nationalists. Historian Basil Davidson viewed the denial of development opportunities for Africa's pre-colonial political entities as the \"black man's burden.\" The end of colonialism in Africa was accelerated by World War II, which weakened Britain and France. The war promoted democracy and resistance to aggression, aligning with Africa's emerging nationalists. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government. During World War II, the Atlantic Charter affirmed the right of all peoples to choose their government. The United Nations Charter further committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. African nationalists, influenced by European intellectual currents, organized opposition to colonial regimes after the war. After World War II, African nationalists returned to Africa and organized opposition to colonial regimes, influenced by European intellectual currents and revolutionary movements in Asia. Nkrumah and other African nationalists were inspired by W.E.B. DuBois. British policymakers granted independence to territories under their control. African nationalists were inspired by revolutionary movements in Asia and the struggle for social justice by black Americans. British policymakers granted independence to India in 1947 and recognized that African colonies would also be independent in the future. France followed a policy of assimilation for its colonies. By the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments were rising in African colonies, leading to guerrilla uprisings against British rule. France pursued a policy of assimilation, aiming to integrate its colonies into a greater France through education and citizenship for select Africans like Leopold Senghor. In the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments were growing in African colonies, leading to guerrilla uprisings against British rule. France assimilated select Africans like Leopold Senghor as French citizens through education. Ghana gained independence as British decision-makers realized the cost of suppressing African nationalism. In the 1950s, African colonies saw growing nationalist sentiments and guerrilla uprisings against British rule. Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence as political parties organized anti-colonial protests. Guinea shocked France by voting for independence in 1958 instead of close association. In the 1950s, African colonies gained independence from European powers. Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya became independent in the early 1960s. Guinea's decision for independence in 1958 surprised France, leading to the emergence of 14 independent countries in French-held Africa. Belgium also granted independence to the Congo in 1960. In the face of agitation for independence, France decided to cut its losses, leading to the emergence of 14 independent countries in French-held Africa in 1960. Belgium also granted independence to the Congo in 1960. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom in some countries. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule. In 1965, Rhodesia declared independence from Britain, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. Guerrilla wars erupted in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s, eventually leading to their independence. Rhodesia declared independence from Britain in 1965, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. Guerrilla wars also occurred in Angola and Mozambique, with independence achieved in 1975. Namibia gained independence in 1990 after a U.N.-supervised election. In the 1960s, Mozambique gained independence in 1975 after a coup in Lisbon ousted Portuguese military dictator Antonio Salazar. Namibia gained independence in 1990 after a U.N.-supervised election. In South Africa, white minority rule was opposed for decades before the National Party came to power in 1948 and implemented racial segregation. In 1948, the National Party (NP) in South Africa imposed apartheid, a system of racial segregation. Protests against apartheid grew in the late 1960s, leading to violent resistance in the 1970s. In the 1980s, as resistance continued, South Africa launched military strikes and covert operations. In the 1980s, South Africa faced international isolation due to apartheid, leading Afrikaner leaders to realize the unsustainable costs of defending the regime. In the late 1980s, South Africa's white-controlled government faced international isolation due to apartheid. Afrikaner leaders realized the costs of defending apartheid were unsustainable. Secret discussions with the ANC led to constitutional negotiations and universal-suffrage elections in 1994, with Nelson Mandela becoming President. In the 1990s, South Africa's regime engaged in secret discussions with the ANC to establish a majority-based system with protections for minority interests. Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, leading to constitutional negotiations and universal-suffrage elections in 1994, where Mandela became President. In the early 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with the departure of colonial governments and the rise of a new educated elite. In April 1994, Nelson Mandela became President after the universal-suffrage elections. In the early 1960s, Africa's future looked bright with the departure of colonial governments and the rise of a new educated elite. GNP per capita was rising, and development projects were expected to accelerate growth. In May 1963, 30 African states signed the Charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to promote solidarity and improve living standards. Despite expectations of faster growth from development projects, problems emerged early on, such as civil war in the former Belgian Congo from 1960-1964. In the early years of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), member states pledged to promote African solidarity and improve living standards while facing challenges like civil war in the former Belgian Congo, coups in Togo and Ghana, and ethnic tensions in Nigeria. In the 1960s, African countries faced political instability with coups and secession attempts, leading to a civil war in Nigeria. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa declined significantly in the following decades. In the 1960s, African countries faced political instability with coups and secession attempts, leading to a civil war in Nigeria. Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth declined significantly in the following decades, with many countries governed by authoritarian regimes and experiencing violent civil wars. In the post-independence era, African countries faced political instability with authoritarian regimes and violent civil wars, exacerbated by drought in the 1980s. The underlying causes of Africa's problems have been widely discussed and analyzed. In the post-independence era, African countries faced political instability with authoritarian regimes and violent civil wars. The impact of the colonial era, blamed for ethnic divisions and authoritarian rule, has been a subject of much discussion. Colleges and universities in African colonies appeared only at the end of the colonial period, leaving small indigenous elites to handle challenges.

The impact of the colonial era, blamed for ethnic divisions and authoritarian rule, has been a subject of much discussion. Colleges and universities in African colonies appeared only at the end of the colonial period, leaving small indigenous elites to handle challenges. Independent Africa also faced a major population challenge, with the sub-Saharan region's population growing from 200 million in 1950 to 600 million in 1990. The Cold War has been implicated in supplying vast quantities of arms to Africa, exacerbating its problems. Independent Africa also faced a major population challenge, with the sub-Saharan region's population growing from 200 million in 1950 to 600 million in 1990. The Cold War supplied vast quantities of arms to Africa, fueling conflicts in countries like Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique. The Soviet Union and its allies provided most of these arms to self-proclaimed Marxist regimes, while the United States focused its economic assistance on authoritarian regimes in countries like Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia. During the Cold War, arms from the Soviet Union fueled African conflicts, mainly supporting Marxist regimes in Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique. In contrast, the United States provided fewer weapons but supported anti-Soviet authoritarian regimes in countries like Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia. Critics argue that this competitive involvement strengthened anti-democratic governments with corrupt economic policies. French policy's impact on Africa's issues remains debated. During the Cold War, arms from the Soviet Union fueled African conflicts, supporting Marxist regimes in Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique. The United States provided weapons to anti-Soviet authoritarian regimes in Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia. Critics argue that this involvement strengthened corrupt, anti-democratic governments. French policy's impact on Africa's issues is still debated. France believed a major African role would enhance its great power status amidst dominant superpowers. They cultivated a \"special relationship\" with their former colonies' elites. France's active engagement in Africa aimed to enhance its great power status by cultivating special relationships with former colonies' elites, providing military and economic assistance, and forging close ties with francophone regimes in Zaire and Rwanda. France maintained special relationships with former colonies' elites, providing military and economic assistance, and privileged access to trade opportunities. French intervention was promised to protect friendly regimes from unrest, with troops stationed in African bases. Critics argued that this policy perpetuated corrupt and authoritarian regimes, while defenders emphasized the benefits of French engagement in Africa. In the 1980s and 1990s, France provided military and economic assistance to former colonies, with French troops stationed in African bases. French businesses gained privileged access to trade opportunities. Critics accused France of supporting corrupt regimes, while defenders argued it contributed to stability and development. France began reducing its commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party's election win in 1997. In the 1980s and 1990s, France provided military and economic assistance to former colonies in Africa. Critics accused France of supporting corrupt regimes, while defenders argued it contributed to stability and development. France began reducing its commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party's election win in 1997. Scholars in the later 1980s and early 1990s focused on African state and society characteristics to explain the continent's difficulties, leading to discouraging conclusions about African states' ability to promote change and economic development. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, scholars analyzed African states and societies to understand the continent's challenges. They found that weak institutions, corrupt leaders, ethnic favoritism, and patrimonialism hindered societal progress and economic development. The \"failed state\" in Africa was attributed to corrupt leaders diverting resources for personal gain, hindering societal progress and economic development. Despite a growth spurt in the mid-1990s, overall GDP growth from 1990 to 1998 was only 2.0% per year, lower than the population growth rate of 2.6%. In the early 1990s, Africa faced economic difficulties with GDP growth lower than population growth. Despite this, there were positive developments giving hope for a better future, including the end of the Cold War and changes in South Africa. In the early 1990s, Africa experienced economic challenges with GDP growth lagging behind population growth. Positive developments, such as the end of the Cold War and changes in South Africa, sparked hope for a brighter future in the region. The momentous changes in South Africa averted a violent revolution, leading to hope for economic growth in the sub-Saharan region. Several African countries were implementing free market reforms with GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates. Political reforms were also underway in authoritarian states in Africa. By the mid-1990s, African countries were experiencing GDP growth rates surpassing population growth rates due to economic reforms prompted by western aid donors. Political reforms were also emerging in authoritarian states in response to demands for democratization from opposition movements and donors, leading to the representation of diverse interests in civil society. Multiple political parties were allowed in some countries. In the mid-1990s, political reforms in Africa led to the representation of diverse interests in civil society, with multiple political parties allowed in some countries. Elections were held, and favorable reactions were noted by analysts. In the mid-1990s, political reforms in Africa allowed multiple parties in countries that were previously one-party states. Elections were held, and analysts noted favorable reactions, although some authoritarian leaders manipulated the process. In the mid-1990s, political reforms in Africa led to the emergence of multiple parties in previously one-party states. However, some authoritarian leaders manipulated the electoral process, leading to disappointment over the course of African democratization. Leaders in countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon have been criticized for creating \"pseudo-democracies\" by liberalizing politically under pressure while repressing opposition to maintain power. In countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon, political reforms have led to the emergence of multiple parties, but some leaders have been criticized for creating \"pseudo-democracies.\" These governments play a cat-and-mouse game with international donors, liberalizing politically under pressure while repressing opposition to maintain power. Africa's democratic opening in the 1990s resulted in \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but systematic stifling of opposition. In 1998, Richard Joseph criticized Africa's democratic opening in the 1990s, stating that many countries had \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but stifled opposition. Recent events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have been discouraging for democratization advocates. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a 1999 military coup and exclusion of a qualified candidate from the Muslim north from elections were particularly concerning. In Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, recent events have been discouraging for democratization advocates. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a 1999 military coup and exclusion of a qualified candidate from the Muslim north from elections were particularly concerning. In Zimbabwe, the opposition made gains in June 2000 parliamentary elections, but the campaign was marred by political violence and government tactics targeting white-owned farms. The 2000 presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe left the country divided along ethnic and religious lines. The opposition made gains in the parliamentary elections, but the campaign was marred by political violence. Government tactics targeting white-owned farms raised concerns about the rule of law. The AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to worsen, with millions infected with the HIV virus. The AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is intensifying, with 25.3 million adults and children infected with the HIV virus in the region. Uganda and Senegal have managed to slow the disease with effective prevention campaigns, but overall infection rates in Africa remain high. The AIDS epidemic in Africa has infected 25.3 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Uganda and Senegal successfully slowing the disease through prevention campaigns. However, the overall infection rate in Africa is 8.8%, much higher than the global rate of 1.1%. Some countries in southern Africa have adult populations with over 20% HIV-positive individuals, leading to an estimated 17 million deaths in the region. The ongoing armed conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, exacerbate the epidemic. The AIDS epidemic in Africa has infected 25.3 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Uganda and Senegal successfully slowing the disease through prevention campaigns.
