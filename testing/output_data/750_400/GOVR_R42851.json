    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods, challenged on grounds of violating the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota emphasized the need for a minimum connection between a state and the transaction being taxed. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a minimum connection between a state and the transaction being taxed in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, federal district courts granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting that the PACT Act may violate the Due Process Clause. In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, federal district courts granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting that the PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes may violate due process by lacking minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction in Red Earth. The PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes may violate due process by lacking minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider the preliminary injunction in Gordon on appeal in the coming months. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider the preliminary injunction in Gordon on appeal in the coming months. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, the federal district court rejected the due process argument regarding the PACT Act, stating it is just a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with the jurisdictions it shipped tobacco products to through its interactive website. The PACT Act requires compliance with state and local laws and does not implicate due process. The court determined that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with the jurisdictions it shipped tobacco products to through its interactive website. Congress may not have the power to require remote retailers to violate the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court in Quill stated that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause, suggesting that requiring remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts may be unconstitutional. The constitutionality of the PACT Act would hinge on what constitutes minimum contacts for remote retailers, as noted in Quill regarding catalogue retailers. The constitutionality of the PACT Act for remote retailers depends on minimum contacts, as noted in Quill. Minimum contacts involve purposeful economic activity in a state, as required by due process for tax obligations. The Supreme Court has stated that minimum contacts for jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants depend on purposeful economic activity in the forum state. Additionally, the Court has emphasized that tax obligations must be rationally related to the state's values. The PACT Act aims to ensure that remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco comply with state laws. The PACT Act aims to require remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with state laws and increase tax collection. It also aims to discourage smuggling and reduce youth access to cheap tobacco products. The PACT Act aims to require remote sellers of tobacco to comply with state laws, increase tax collection, discourage smuggling, and reduce youth access to cheap tobacco products by deeming interstate sales as intrastate sales. The PACT Act deems interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring compliance with state laws, including excise taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. Additionally, remote sellers must pay state and local taxes before delivery. The PACT Act requires compliance with state laws for sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including excise taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. Remote sellers must pay all applicable taxes before delivery. The PACT Act mandates that remote sellers pay all taxes on sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in the buyer's locality and comply with state laws. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. States cannot unduly burden interstate commerce or impose taxes on foreign businesses without a sufficient connection to the state. The Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit state taxes that burden interstate commerce or lack sufficient connection to the state for foreign businesses. Congress can authorize state activities that comply with the Commerce Clause but not the Due Process Clause. Remote retailers are challenging the PACT Act. The PACT Act is being challenged by remote retailers under the Due Process Clause, which is governed by the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill. In Quill, the Court considered whether out-of-state retailers could be required to collect use taxes in a state. The remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, citing the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill. In Quill, the Court addressed the issue of whether out-of-state retailers must collect use taxes in a state, emphasizing the requirement of minimum contacts for physical presence. The Court's reasoning was compared to jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The Supreme Court upheld state taxation of out-of-state businesses under the Due Process Clause, requiring a physical presence to satisfy minimum contacts. Citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, the Court emphasized that jurisdiction can be established even without physical entry into the forum State. The Supreme Court upheld state taxation of out-of-state businesses under the Due Process Clause, requiring a physical presence to satisfy minimum contacts. In Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, the Court upheld the jurisdiction of Florida courts over an out-of-state franchisee who conducted business remotely in Florida, stating that physical presence in the forum State is not necessary for jurisdiction. In modern commercial life, business conducted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines can establish jurisdiction even without physical presence. Personal jurisdiction has been upheld when a commercial actor's efforts are directed towards residents of another State, regardless of physical contacts. The Supreme Court's decision in Quill emphasized that directing marketing materials to residents of a State can establish jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's decision in Quill emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established when a business directs its activities towards residents of another State, even without physical presence. This was demonstrated in the case where a retailer sent catalogues to North Dakota residents, satisfying the requirement for minimum contacts. The key issue under Quill is whether the out-of-state business has purposefully directed its activities at the taxing state. The Court found that the retailer had \"fair warning\" of being subject to tax due to purposefully directing activities at North Dakota residents, meeting the minimum contacts requirement. The issue under Quill is whether an out-of-state business has directed activities at the taxing state, giving fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, Seneca Nation members sought to block enforcement of the PACT Act's tax payment requirement for their online tobacco retail businesses. In Red Earth, Seneca Nation members challenged the PACT Act's tax requirement for their online tobacco businesses, arguing it violates Due Process by subjecting them to state taxing jurisdiction without sufficient contacts. The United States contended there was no due process violation. The plaintiffs in Red Earth challenged the PACT Act's tax requirement for their online tobacco businesses, claiming it violates Due Process by subjecting them to state taxing jurisdiction without sufficient contacts. The United States argued there was no due process violation, citing the plaintiffs' websites advertising products for sale and shipping goods into taxing jurisdictions. The district court rejected these arguments, finding issues with the argument related to maintaining a website. The United States argued that the PACT Act did not violate due process as plaintiffs' websites and shipping goods into taxing jurisdictions satisfied minimum contacts. However, the district court disagreed, noting that not all plaintiffs had websites and that the websites were passive virtual catalogs. The court determined that the plaintiffs' passive websites, resembling virtual mail order catalogs, did not establish sufficient minimum contacts for the PACT Act to apply, regardless of whether all plaintiffs had websites or not. The court ruled that passive websites, similar to virtual mail order catalogs, did not create enough minimum contacts for the PACT Act to apply. Purchases could only be finalized with a money order, not online. The court also dismissed the argument that shipping into a state established minimum contacts. The court rejected the argument that a passive website or shipment into a state creates minimum contacts for tax collection. It stated that a single sale may not be enough to subject a seller to a foreign jurisdiction. The court rejected the idea that a single sale creates minimum contacts for tax collection on an out-of-state seller, as it found no cases supporting this notion. The court rejected the notion that a single sale creates minimum contacts for tax collection on an out-of-state seller, citing cases that found a single sale insufficient. The court emphasized the importance of requiring minimum contacts before subjecting out-of-state retailers to state laws. The court rejected the idea that a single sale establishes minimum contacts for tax collection on an out-of-state seller. It emphasized the need for minimum contacts before subjecting out-of-state retailers to state laws, stating that the PACT Act may be overreaching by disregarding due process constraints. The PACT Act may be overreaching by broadening state and local jurisdiction without regard to the Due Process Clause. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was challenged by the government in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The issue at hand is whether Congress can require vendors to submit to constitutional due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a seller to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery, without considering the extent of the vendor's contact with the state. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a vendor to submit to the taxing jurisdiction of any state into which it makes at least one sale, without considering the extent of the vendor's contact with the state. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale is sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. The federal courts have avoided ruling on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. The Supreme Court has not definitively decided on this issue. The district court's decision on a close legal question was upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The district court's decision on a close legal question was upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, suggesting that a court reviewing the issuance of a preliminary injunction should uphold the injunction and remand for trial on the merits. In Musser's case, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction based on the PACT Act's requirement for retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions. In Musser's case, the plaintiff, a tobacco retailer operating nationwide, sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act, claiming that the requirement to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts violated the Due Process Clause. The district court denied the injunction, disagreeing with a previous court's analysis of the Act's tax-payment requirement. The district court denied the injunction under two alternative analyses, rejecting the previous court's analysis of the PACT Act's tax-payment requirement. Congress, not states, imposes the tax-payment requirement on interstate businesses, reflecting the federal nature of the legislation. The tax-payment requirement imposed by Congress on interstate businesses reflects the federal nature of the legislation, requiring compliance with state and local laws. This has been upheld as not offending due process for businesses such as firearms distributors, online pharmacies, farmers, and distributors of explosives. Congress requires distributors, online pharmacies, farmers, and distributors of explosives to comply with state and local laws when selling products. This does not violate due process and falls under Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce. The court's analysis conflates Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause with state taxation of out-of-state businesses. The plaintiff was found to have minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach from Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. The court concluded that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach from Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. In Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., personal jurisdiction over a defendant in foreign jurisdictions varies based on their level of interaction on an interactive website. Simply posting information online is not sufficient for personal jurisdiction, while actively conducting business over the Internet can establish jurisdiction. In cases involving personal jurisdiction over defendants in foreign jurisdictions, the level of interaction on an interactive website determines jurisdiction. Simply posting information online is not enough, while actively conducting business online can establish jurisdiction. The court examines the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information on the website to determine jurisdiction. In cases involving personal jurisdiction over defendants in foreign jurisdictions, the level of interaction on an interactive website determines jurisdiction. The court examines the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information on the website to determine jurisdiction. Musser's case demonstrated that selling products over the Internet and conducting business through the Internet in a state is sufficient contact to establish jurisdiction. The court's reasoning suggests that minimum contacts for jurisdiction can be satisfied by a single sale through an interactive website. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling cigarettes and tobacco products. Under the court's reasoning, minimum contacts for jurisdiction can be satisfied by a single sale through an interactive website. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling cigarettes and tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's requirement to pay state and local taxes on tobacco products sent to other jurisdictions, arguing it violates due process. Gordon, a Seneca Nation member, owns a store selling tobacco products and has a passive website for orders. He sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process. The district court initially denied his motion as untimely, but the Court of Appeals reversed, deeming it timely. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, finding it timely. The Court noted that Congress authorizing state levies based on minimum contacts does not eliminate Due Process violations. The Court of Appeals reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, finding it timely. They emphasized that Congress authorizing state levies based on minimum contacts does not eliminate Due Process violations, as the inquiries of Due Process and Commerce Clause are distinct. National legislation that sanctions burdens on interstate commerce cannot violate principles of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" The question of national authorization of disparate excise taxes remains open. The Court of Appeals emphasized that national legislation allowing state levies based on minimum contacts does not eliminate Due Process violations. The question of national authorization of disparate excise taxes remains open. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, under the PACT Act. They also claimed that each of Gordon's tobacco sales into a state satisfies minimum contacts with that state, citing Supreme Court cases to support their position. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, under the PACT Act. They claimed that each of Gordon's tobacco sales into a state satisfies minimum contacts with that state, citing Supreme Court cases to support their position. The government cited cases where interstate businesses were not subject to the jurisdiction of any particular states when complying with laws of the jurisdiction they shipped products to. The court distinguished previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to state jurisdiction when complying with laws of the jurisdiction they shipped products to. The PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid, which the court believed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had rejected. The PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid, as stated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's and concluded that the PACT Act is similar to federal statutes requiring compliance with state law. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's and concluded that the PACT Act is similar to federal statutes requiring compliance with state law, stating that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court in Musser's case collapsed the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the PACT Act challenge, citing similarities to federal statutes requiring compliance with state law. The court reviewed key due process cases to determine if Gordon's sales established minimum contacts. The court reviewed key due process cases, including International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, to determine if minimum contacts were established for personal jurisdiction. The court found that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State, as outlined in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. Jurisdiction is proper when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum State by engaging in significant activities or creating continuing obligations with residents. The Supreme Court's opinion in Burger King stated that jurisdiction is proper when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum State by engaging in significant activities or creating continuing obligations with residents. It is not unreasonable to require the defendant to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum if their activities are shielded by the benefits and protections of the forum's laws. The district court found that a single act creating a substantial connection with the forum justifies jurisdiction, but acts with only a weak affiliation are not enough for foreseeable litigation in the forum. This principle was highlighted in the World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson case. The Burger King Court emphasized that a single act can establish jurisdiction if it has a substantial connection with the forum. However, acts that only have a weak affiliation with the forum are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation. The focus is on foreseeability, where the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum state should reasonably anticipate being sued there, providing predictability to the legal system. In Corp. v. Woodson, the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, stating that defendants should reasonably anticipate being sued in a forum state based on their conduct. This focus on predictability allows potential defendants to structure their actions with some assurance of where they may be liable to suit. The district court also discussed Quill and the Due Process Clause requirements. The district court discussed Quill and the Due Process Clause requirements, emphasizing the need for a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax. Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota. The Due Process Clause requires a minimum connection between a state and the entity it seeks to tax. In Quill, the Court found that the mail order business had sufficient contacts with North Dakota to meet due process requirements. The Quill standard for minimum contacts with North Dakota was not met in Gordon's case as his business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market in the states where he sold products. The district court in Gordon's case found that the Quill standard was not met as his business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market in the states where he sold products. The court also did not find that the tax on Gordon's products was rationally related to the values connected with the taxing State. The district court did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the benefits provided by the state. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process as it is unclear what benefits Gordon receives from the state for which it can ask return. The court concluded that due process is not satisfied by a single sale of cigarettes into a state. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process by allowing state taxation of out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts, potentially violating the Commerce Clause. The PACT Act may violate the Commerce Clause by subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts, potentially conflicting with the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act's constitutionality under the Due Process Clause is questioned as it may allow state taxation of retailers without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may have conflated the Commerce Clause and due process analyses. It remains uncertain if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the due process requirement. The PACT Act's constitutionality under the Due Process Clause is uncertain, as it may allow state taxation without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may have mixed up the Commerce Clause and due process analyses. It is unclear if a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies the due process requirement."
