    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, also known as Housing Choice Vouchers. These vouchers are federally funded and administered by local public housing authorities to provide rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. Section 8 vouchers are rental subsidies for low-income families administered by public housing authorities. The cost of a voucher is based on the difference between actual rent and a payment standard, and 30% of the tenant's income. This cost fluctuates with changes in tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards. The Section 8 voucher program provides rental subsidies for low-income families based on the difference between actual rent and a payment standard, as well as 30% of the tenant's income. Recent changes in funding distribution have created uncertainty for public housing authorities, prompting calls for a permanent funding formula. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher renewal funding distribution, causing uncertainty for public housing authorities. Calls have been made for a permanent funding formula to address this issue. The report discusses changes in Section 8 voucher renewal funding formula enacted by Congress starting in FY2003. Prior to this, PHAs were funded based on previous year's per-voucher cost adjusted for inflation. Each PHA also received a reserve fund. In FY2003, Congress changed the Section 8 voucher renewal funding formula. PHAs were funded based on the previous year's per-voucher cost adjusted for inflation, with a reserve fund provided. Despite full funding, few PHAs leased all authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates below the expected 95%. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates below the expected 95%. This resulted in PHAs having excess funds in their budgets and rarely needing to dip into their reserves, allowing HUD to recapture excess funds at the end of the year. PHAs often had low budget utilization and excess funds in their budgets due to not leasing all authorized vouchers. HUD would recapture excess funds at the end of the year by reconciling budgets with PHAs. HUD used a formula to request funding from Congress for Section 8 vouchers renewal. Unused funds were also made available for rescission. HUD used a formula based on actual costs and inflation to request funding from Congress for the renewal of tenant-based Section 8 vouchers. PHAs could recapture excess funds from their reserves, which could be used for maximized leasing to create new vouchers. Congress provided more funds each year for vouchers based on this system. The funding system for PHAs allowed them to recapture unused funds and increase funding along with costs. Congress provided more funds for voucher renewals than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed funding to limit recaptures and better reflect actual use of vouchers. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for PHAs to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and better reflect actual voucher use. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor. The funding system for PHAs was changed in FY2003 to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and better reflect actual voucher use. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor, and multiplied by the number of vouchers the PHA could reasonably be expected to lease in that year. The law directed HUD to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for PHAs based on the total number of unit months under lease, adjusted by additional information and an inflation factor. HUD implemented a provision to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies based on utilization rates and costs reported on their financial statements or more recent data. HUD implemented a provision for PHAs to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts based on utilization rates and costs reported on their financial statements or more recent data. Renewal calculations will be adjusted by applying Annual Adjustment Factors. Renewal calculations under the 2003 Appropriation will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data reported by PHAs. Costs will be adjusted using Annual Adjustment Factors, and funding increments will generally be renewed for three months. The use of recent data and short renewal terms will improve funding accuracy. Congress also established a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves. The Central Reserve fund was created by Congress for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves in case they had to cover increased costs. Funding increments will be renewed for three months based on recent leasing and cost data for more accurate calculations. The Secretary can use the Central Reserve fund to cover increased costs for PHAs. The bill also imposed restrictions on maximized leasing. The bill imposed restrictions on maximized leasing, preventing PHAs from supporting more vouchers than authorized. This caused issues for over-leased PHAs, leading to a halt in reissuing vouchers to align with authorized levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the trend set by the FY2003 law. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the trend of funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization, restricting maximized leasing, and addressing concerns about cost increases. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the trend of funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and addressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program. The conference report emphasized the need for the Secretary to control costs related to renewing expiring annual contributions contracts. The FY2004 appropriations law addressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program and emphasized the need for the Secretary to control costs related to renewing expiring annual contributions contracts. The Secretary was expected to utilize administrative authority to control rapidly rising costs. The FY2004 appropriations law emphasized the need for the Secretary to control costs related to renewing expiring annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies based on unit months under lease and inflation factors. (H.Rept. 108-235, Title II) The FY2004 appropriations law required the Secretary to control costs for renewing public housing agency contracts based on unit months under lease and inflation factors. The Central Reserve fund usage also changed in FY2004 compared to FY2003. The FY2004 appropriations law changed the usage of the Central Reserve fund compared to FY2003, allowing it to be used only to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. In FY2004, the Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice implementing the appropriations law, basing PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 (PIH 2004-7) implementing the FY2004 appropriations law for PHAs' budgets based on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements. PHAs could appeal to the Secretary if rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD, which was controversial among housing advocates. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 implementing the FY2004 appropriations law for PHAs' budgets. PHAs could appeal if rental costs had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. Some housing advocates argued for a broader measure of inflation. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400. Some housing advocates argued for a broader measure of inflation for PHAs' budgets. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The final FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act moved the program towards budget-based funding. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 out of 400 agencies, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed funding based on PHAs' voucher costs and utilization rates as of May-July 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding was based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial data. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding was based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial data. If the allocated amount was insufficient, budgets were prorated among agencies. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If the allocated amount was insufficient, budgets were prorated among agencies. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and flexibility to adjust payment standards. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. Agencies were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and flexibility to adjust payment standards. The act also made changes to the way PHAs received their voucher renewal funding, shifting from federal fiscal year to calendar year funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act changed how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to calendar year funding from federal fiscal year funding. This adjustment required PHAs to adjust their budgeting cycle and was implemented through HUD guidance on December 8, 2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act changed voucher renewal funding to a calendar-year cycle, requiring PHAs to adjust their budgeting process. HUD provided guidance on December 8, 2004, with agencies notified of preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004. Appeals were limited to data errors, not the budget calculation formula. HUD provided guidance on December 8, 2004, with agencies notified of preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004. PHAs were directed to report data errors within 10 days. Appeals were limited to data errors, not the budget calculation formula. Final calculations, including a proration factor, were published on January 21, 2005, with agencies funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF. The final calculations, with a proration factor, were published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF. The proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress for voucher renewals. According to CRS analysis, the median change in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005 was an increase of 0.17%, with a wide variance in changes ranging from a 12% decrease to a 14% increase. HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9 on February 25, 2005, providing PHAs with options to lower costs in managing the Housing Choice Voucher Program in 2005. Suggestions included lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, restricting portability, and reviewing rents. On February 25, 2005, HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9, offering PHAs ways to reduce costs in managing the Housing Choice Voucher Program in 2005. Suggestions included lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, restricting portability, reviewing rents, and implementing other cost-saving measures. HUD offered ways to reduce costs in managing the Housing Choice Voucher Program in 2005, such as lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, restricting portability, reviewing rents, and implementing cost-saving measures. Additionally, the FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act distributed renewal funding based on previous eligibility, inflation adjustments, and proration. Other measures included restricting bedroom sizes, instituting minimum rents, monitoring income eligibility more strictly, and terminating assistance due to insufficient funds. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) allocated renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit the appropriation amount. The act also provided $45 million for budget adjustments for agencies with low leasing or increased costs. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act allocated renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit the appropriation amount. The act also provided $45 million for budget adjustments for agencies with low leasing or increased costs. HUD issued projected funding letters to all PHAs on January 19, 2006, with a deadline for concerns by February 3, 2006. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act allocated funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient Congress funding. Changes in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, reversing the cost growth trend seen in 2003. The changes enacted in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, leading to a decline in average annual per voucher costs and utilization rates from 2004 to 2006. The cost growth trend in 2003 led to a decline in average annual per voucher costs and utilization rates from 2004 to 2006. This resulted in fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004, as most PHAs had accumulated reserve funds due to unspent balances. Budget utilization for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) dropped from over 98% in 2003 and 2004 to under 92% in 2006. This led to nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds due to not spending all of their funding, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 to September 2006. The debate in FY2007 continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. In FY2007, the debate continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Then-President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005 and FY2006, and to lift the prohibition on maximized leasing. In FY2007, then-President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005 and FY2006. The budget also asked Congress to lift the prohibition on maximized leasing, as some PHAs were receiving more funding than they could use. As of September 2006, 168 PHAs were at their cap on authorized vouchers, with excess funding they couldn't utilize. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula. They lifted the prohibition on maximized leasing, as some PHAs were receiving more funding than they could use. As of September 2006, 168 PHAs were at their cap on authorized vouchers, with excess funding they couldn't utilize. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula. PHAs received funding based on their leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. In FY2007, PHAs received funding based on leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. The law included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts. The law included a central reserve fund for adjustments for PHAs experiencing significant changes in renewal costs or voucher funding. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain Hurricane Katrina-affected agencies. The funding formula shift could lead to a loss of voucher units, with exceptions for certain PHAs, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina and agencies under receivership. P.L. 110-28 amended the formula to provide funding based on higher amounts received in previous years. The FY2007 formula change in funding for PHAs was based on higher amounts received in previous years, with exceptions for certain agencies under receivership or affected by Hurricane Katrina. The FY2007 formula change in funding for PHAs was based on their usage in FY2006 rather than their FY2006 allocations. PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates did better under the new formula, while those with lower costs did worse. However, all PHAs were funded at more than 105% of their eligibility. The FY2007 formula for funding PHAs was based on their FY2006 usage, benefiting those with higher costs and utilization rates. All PHAs were funded at more than 105% of their eligibility, ensuring continued service for families. The formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements. The FY2007 formula for funding PHAs was unit-based and budget-based, ensuring agencies received more than 105% of their eligibility to serve families. The FY2007 funding formula for PHAs was unit-based and budget-based, with funding allocations tied to the number of vouchers used and subject to caps. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed a similar \"budget-based\" formula, requesting agencies be funded based on their 2007 eligibility adjusted for the AAF. Then-President Bush's FY2008 budget request included a proposal for a budget-based voucher funding formula, with agencies funded based on their 2007 eligibility adjusted for the AAF, FSS program deposits, and tenant protection vouchers. Future plans included re-benchmarking the formula with more recent data, possibly in FY2009. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula similar to the one proposed in President Bush's FY2008 budget. Agencies were funded based on their leasing and costs in the prior calendar year, adjusted for the AAF, FSS deposits, tenant protection vouchers, and vouchers set-aside. The President planned to re-benchmark the formula with more recent data, possibly in FY2009. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a funding formula based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. It included a central reserve fund for adjustments and alternative formulas for specific agencies. Unlike FY2007, the FY2008 Act provided these provisions. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions for protection vouchers, project-based commitments, a central reserve fund for adjustments, and alternative formulas for specific agencies. It also included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007, totaling $723 million in FY2008 renewal funding. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs due to unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007, allowing Congress to reduce new appropriations without affecting funding available for renewals in FY2008. President Bush also requested a similar approach in FY2009. In FY2008, PHAs had unusable reserves above 7% of their funding, leading to a reduction in new appropriations for voucher renewals without affecting total funding available. President Bush requested a budget-based funding formula in FY2009, but Congress rejected it, opting for a hybrid, cost, and utilization-based formula instead. In FY2009, Congress rejected President Bush's request for a budget-based funding formula and directed HUD to fund PHAs based on a hybrid, cost, and utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008. Funding was determined by the number and cost of vouchers leased in FY2008, adjusted for inflation, with allocations prorated based on HUD's estimate of Net Restricted Assets. The utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008 directed HUD to fund PHAs based on leased vouchers' number and cost in FY2008, adjusted for inflation. Each PHA's allocation was prorated based on HUD's estimate of Net Restricted Assets, with an aggregate NRA offset of $750 million. PHAs were expected to supplement their funding with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments in certain circumstances. The CY2009 allocations for PHAs were based on utilization and cost data from FY2008. PHAs were to supplement their funding with unused Net Restricted Assets (NRA) and a $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments in specific situations. HUD allocated CY2009 funds to PHAs based on utilization and cost data from FY2008. However, inaccuracies in estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA balances were noted, partly due to inaccurately reported data and changes in cost and leasing conditions. HUD allocated CY2009 funds to PHAs based on FY2008 data, but inaccuracies in estimates of costs and utilization led to funding shortages for some PHAs in CY2009. HUD estimated that around 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls in CY2009. Some agencies received additional funding from HUD's set-asides to cover the costs, while others were advised on cost-cutting measures. HUD estimated that around 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls in CY2009. Some agencies received additional funding from HUD's set-asides to cover the costs, while others were advised on cost-cutting measures. PHAs were asked to contact HUD before terminating assistance to families in case of shortfalls. HUD requested that agencies facing funding shortfalls in CY2009 contact them before terminating assistance to families. Congress passed legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million in additional funding to prevent families from losing assistance. This policy change increased the amount of renewal funding available for PHAs at risk of terminating assistance. In response to concerns about families losing assistance, Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million in additional funding to prevent termination of assistance to families in CY2009. This policy change increased renewal funding for PHAs at risk of terminating assistance and represented a different approach to voucher funding in FY2010 under the Obama Administration. In FY2009, HUD increased set-aside renewal funding to $100 million and expanded its purposes to prevent assistance termination. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, with the addition of offsetting agencies' budgets for excess reserves at the Secretary's discretion. The President's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, with the addition of offsetting agencies' budgets for excess reserves at the Secretary's discretion and lifting the prohibition on over-leasing for PHAs to fully utilize their budgets. The final FY2010 funding law adopted a similar funding formula based on FY2009. The FY2010 funding law adopted a funding formula similar to the Administration's request, based on FY2009 data adjusted for inflation. However, it did not grant the Secretary authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike previous years, the FY2010 allocation formula did not include an offset for unspent agency reserves. The FY2010 funding law adopted a funding formula similar to the Administration's request, based on FY2009 data adjusted for inflation. It did not grant the Secretary authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike previous years, the FY2010 allocation formula did not include an offset for unspent agency reserves. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization, with no offset from PHA reserves in FY2011 and a $650 million rescission in FY2012. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization. The FY2011 law contained no offset from PHA reserves; the FY2012 law included a $650 million rescission to be offset from allocations to PHAs with reserves above a certain level determined by HUD. PHAs were serving as many families as they were authorized to serve and spending nearly every federal dollar they received following funding formula changes that began in FY2003. Following funding formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006, PHAs served fewer families and spent a smaller share of federal funding. Low utilization of funding and vouchers continued after another formula change in FY2007. Following funding formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006, PHAs served fewer families and spent a smaller share of federal funding. Low utilization of funding and vouchers continued after another formula change in FY2007. However, with the shift to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model, PHAs saw an increase in funding utilization from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. Additionally, they were able to serve over 150,000 more families by the end of 2009 compared to 2006. Following the shift to a hybrid cost and utilization-based funding model, PHAs experienced an increase in funding utilization from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. They were able to serve over 150,000 more families by the end of 2009 compared to 2006, surpassing the previous high point in families served in 2003. Reserves accumulated during the budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006 were largely spent down by the end of FY2009 due to rescissions enacted in FY2008 and FY2009. By 2009, PHAs were serving more families than in 2003, with reserves spent down due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Congressional members have introduced voucher reform legislation to change the funding formula. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were anticipated to continue increasing in CY2012. Some Members of Congress have introduced voucher reform legislation with changes to the funding formula, but the Appropriations Committees could override it with a different allocation formula in the annual appropriations act. The Section 8 voucher program funding formula can be overridden by the Appropriations Committees, even if a new formula is adopted through the authorizing process. Prior to FY2003, the program was funded like an entitlement program with funding largely determined by a formula. Since FY2003, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher program funding to gain more control over costs and address inefficiencies. Prior to FY2003, funding was determined by a formula, limiting Congress's ability to constrain funding without reducing vouchers. Since FY2003, Congress has implemented changes to the Section 8 voucher program funding to gain more control over costs and address inefficiencies. The funding structure was converted to a fixed sum model, giving Congress greater budget control, although many PHAs argued against the changes. The Section 8 voucher program underwent changes in FY2003, converting its funding structure to a fixed sum model. This gave Congress more budget control but made the program harder to administer for PHAs. The Section 8 voucher program underwent changes in FY2003, converting its funding structure to a fixed sum model. PHAs found the program more difficult to administer due to limited control over costs and changes in payment standards. Some PHAs lowered payment standards and conducted rent reasonableness reviews to reduce rents paid to landlords. Many PHAs made changes to the Section 8 voucher program by lowering payment standards, conducting rent reasonableness reviews, and selecting higher-income families from waiting lists to reduce costs. Some landlords accepted reduced rents, while others chose to no longer participate in the program. PHAs intentionally reduced their utilization rates by not reissuing vouchers. Many PHAs made changes to the Section 8 voucher program by selecting higher-income families from waiting lists to reduce costs. Some landlords accepted reduced rents, while others chose to no longer participate in the program. PHAs intentionally lowered their utilization rates to save money, which led to budget constraints in the following year. Some PHAs intentionally lowered utilization rates to save money in the Section 8 voucher program, leading to budget constraints in the following year. Data from HUD shows that voucher costs and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. Average voucher costs decreased by around 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2% during that period. Changes in the Section 8 voucher program led to fewer households receiving vouchers as costs rose faster than funding. Data from HUD showed that voucher costs leveled off and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. Average voucher costs decreased by around 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2% during that period. Some agencies were receiving more funding than allowed, leading to budget constraints. Some PHAs had excess funds they couldn't spend due to budget-based funding formulas in FY2005 and FY2006, despite having waiting lists for vouchers. This led to controversy among low-income housing advocates and the PHA industry. Some PHAs had funds they couldn't spend due to budget-based funding formulas, leading to controversy among low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. Advocates called for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula, as the FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the one that was in place when the changes first began. PHAs were funded based on the amount of funding they were using in the previous year, rather than the amount of money they had received in the previous year, causing controversy among low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. The FY2007 funding bill implemented a voucher renewal funding formula based on previous year's usage, causing controversy among housing advocates and PHA industry groups. PHAs with surpluses received less funding, but overall funding was sufficient to serve all eligible families. Subsequent formulas in FY2008 and FY2009 closely followed the FY2007 formula. In FY2007, PHAs with surpluses received less funding, but overall funding was sufficient to serve all eligible families. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in budgets for agencies with excess reserve funding. In FY2007, PHAs with surpluses received less funding, but overall funding was sufficient to serve all eligible families. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in budgets for agencies with excess reserve funding. The FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar to FY2009, without reductions related to reserves. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization and spend all funding. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization and spend all funding. Costs and utilization have begun rising, increasing the program's cost to Congress and potentially pressuring policymakers to contain costs. The funding model has shifted to incentivize PHAs to increase utilization and spend all funding, leading to rising costs and utilization. This could pressure policymakers to find ways to contain costs in the program while maintaining a level of service to families. Cost containment strategies in the Section 8 voucher program have reduced the number of families served and resulted in unspent funds. Future policies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing fund accumulation. Proposed reforms focus on maximizing family assistance without capping cost growth, potentially subject to future appropriations legislation."
