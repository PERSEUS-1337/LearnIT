    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations or CCM, affects approximately 1,500,000 individuals in the United States. This blood vessel disease is characterized by vascular lesions that develop in the brain and spinal cord. Detection of these lesions requires costly medical imaging techniques, and individuals may not be aware of the disease until serious symptoms appear. Cavernous angioma lesions develop in the brain and spinal cord and are detected through specialized medical imaging techniques. Individuals may not be aware of the disease until serious symptoms like neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death occur. Limited research on cavernous angioma means there is currently no treatment other than brain and spinal surgery. Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death. Limited research on the disease means there is no treatment other than brain and spinal surgery, with some individuals not being candidates for surgery. A shortage of physicians familiar with cavernous angioma poses challenges for affected individuals. Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not candidates for brain surgery, and no treatment option is available for such individuals. There is a shortage of physicians familiar with cavernous angioma, making it difficult for affected individuals to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care. The presence of a specific disease-causing mutation, termed the \"common Hispanic mutation,\" has passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, agreed to in May. In the 1590s, New Mexico had the highest population density of cavernous angioma globally, affecting tens of thousands of individuals. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, adopted in May 2009, emphasizes the need for increased research, awareness, and education on cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research advancements through extramural research. The Senate Resolution adopted in May 2009 highlights the critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence to better understand complex biomedical systems and translate scientific discoveries into clinical applications. The National Institutes of Health supports research through extramural centers of excellence to understand biomedical systems and translate discoveries into clinical applications. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed in New Mexico and the United States. This center aims to provide a model medical system, facilitate research for a cure, and enhance medical care nationwide, leveraging the expertise at the University of New Mexico. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico to develop a cure and enhance medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Cavernous Angioma Care Center of Excellence. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research on diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for individuals with cavernous angioma.
