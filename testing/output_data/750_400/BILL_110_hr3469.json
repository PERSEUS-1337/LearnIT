The Secretary of Homeland Security is developing an aerial surveillance program to enhance border security with unmanned aerial vehicles along the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders. The Secretary of Homeland Security is implementing an aerial surveillance program using unmanned aerial vehicles to enhance border security along the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders, ensuring continuous monitoring of each mile of the border. The Secretary of Homeland Security is developing a program to monitor each mile of the US-Mexico border using aerial surveillance technologies, consulting with the Secretary of Defense on border threats. The Secretary of Homeland Security is exploring the use of surveillance technologies to address border threats, consulting with the Secretary of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration for deployment and safety considerations. The Secretary of Homeland Security is developing a program for aerial surveillance technologies along the international border of the United States, consulting with the Federal Aviation Administration for safety and airspace coordination. The program developed for aerial surveillance technologies along the international border of the United States will include the use of various aerial surveillance technologies in different terrains to assess different circumstances. The program will evaluate surveillance technologies in various topographies and areas near the US international border to assess the significance, cost, and effectiveness for border security. The Secretary of Homeland Security may continue using aerial surveillance technologies for border security, considering cost, effectiveness, liability, safety, and privacy concerns. The Secretary of Homeland Security can continue using aerial surveillance technologies for border security, addressing concerns about cost, effectiveness, liability, safety, and privacy.
