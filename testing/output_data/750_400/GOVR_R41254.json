    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, allowing spending at FY2010 levels. Restrictions included a prohibition on new programs. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill for the rest of FY2011 was signed, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities. The President signed an omnibus funding bill on April 15, 2011, providing $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, with a reduction of $18.2 billion from the requested amount. The omnibus funding bill signed by the President on April 15, 2011, allocated $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, with a $18.2 billion reduction from the requested amount. Additionally, $17.8 billion was provided for DOD's military construction budget, a $2.2 billion decrease from the President's request. H.R. 1473 incorporated $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request for broad spending categories. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for DOD activities, with a $2.2 billion reduction from the President's request. The bill included $4.4 billion in reductions, such as $2.0 billion rescinded from prior DOD funds, $1.5 billion cut from various programs, $723 million from civilian pay, and $125 million from federally funded programs. The bill included significant reductions, such as $2.0 billion rescinded from DOD funds, $1.5 billion cut from various programs, $723 million from civilian pay, and $125 million from federally funded research and development corporations. Additionally, cuts were made to major weapons programs, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill made significant reductions to federally funded research and development corporations (FFRDCs) like RAND, as well as major weapons programs. This included cuts to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The cuts in the President's DOD budget by H.R. 1473 were partially offset by additional funds added in 226 instances by the bill. The bill made cuts to major weapons programs, including a new ground combat vehicle for the Army and a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. However, it also added funds in 226 instances, including money for Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard, medical research programs, Israeli missile defense systems, and increased funding for the Military. The bill added funds to the budget request for various purposes, including Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard, medical research programs, Israeli missile defense systems, and increased funding for the Military Career Advancement Account program. It did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act added $165.0 million to the Military Career Advancement Account program for tuition assistance to service members' spouses. It did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House version authorized $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate version authorized $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million. The House and Senate versions of the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $725.9 billion and $725.7 billion for defense activities, respectively. The Senate version was not acted upon due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate did not act on the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, which included a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The bill was set aside after a failed cloture vote. House and Senate committees negotiated a compromise version (H.R. 6523) of the authorization bill. The Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on the bill S. 3454, known as \"don't ask, don't tell.\" A compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was signed by the President on January 7, 2011, dropping the provision related to the policy. The authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was signed by the President on January 7, 2011, dropping the provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Both versions of the bill supported the Administration's budget request and did not allocate funds for the production of the C-17 long-range cargo plane. The enacted H.R. 6523 supported President Obama's position by not adding funds for the C-17 cargo plane production. It authorized a 1.9% increase in military pay and $485 million for an alternate F-35 jet engine, contrary to the President's requests. The enacted version of the FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was not requested in the budget. The FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. The FY2011 budget for the federal government's military activities (function 050) includes $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees. The FY2011 budget for function 050 includes $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees, with the largest share for those receiving \"concurrent receipt\" of military and disability pensions. The total DOD request for FY2011 is $708.3 billion, including $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Additionally, $33 billion was requested for supplemental DOD funding. The FY2011 DOD budget request totaled $708.3 billion, including $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. An additional $33 billion was requested for supplemental DOD funding for war costs. The Administration requested $33 billion in supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total amount appropriated for war costs to $162.6 billion. The FY2011 war budget request was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than FY2010. The FY2010 DOD appropriations bill allocated $162.6 billion for war costs, with a $33 billion supplemental request. The FY2011 war budget request was $159.3 billion, showing a shift from Iraq to Afghanistan operations. The FY2010 war budget shifted emphasis from Iraq to Afghanistan operations, with a $33 billion supplemental request. An additional $655 million was allocated for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the devastating earthquake. The DOD relief effort included Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel deployment. The DOD requested an additional $655 million for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. This funding would increase the base budget by 3.4% in FY2011, providing real growth in purchasing power. The DOD relief effort involved Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel deployment. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary spending, including real growth in purchasing power for security agencies like the Department of State, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, representing a 5.2% increase from FY2010. Non-security agencies saw a 1.5% decrease in funding, with a request of $386.4 billion for FY2011. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. Non-security agencies received $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The DOD base budget requested for FY2011 is $548.9 billion, a 3.4% increase from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year. This 3.4% increase would provide a 1.8% increase in real purchasing power after adjusting for inflation. The request continues the upward trend in DOD base budgets since FY1998, making it the third largest budget since the end of the Korean War. The FY2011 DOD base budget request continues the upward trend in budgets since FY1998, projected to be the third largest since the Korean War, with annual increases exceeding inflation for the following four years. Defense Secretary Gates highlighted the need for a 2% real growth rate to cover necessary investments. The Reagan Administration's defense buildup includes annual budget increases exceeding inflation for FY2012-FY2015, falling short of the 2% real growth rate needed for planned investments. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap. In 2009, Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Real growth in the defense budget of 2-3% above inflation was deemed necessary but unlikely to be achieved. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to provide necessary real growth for combat forces, offsetting costs by reducing spending on administrative and support activities. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to increase support for combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support activities. This strategy aims to cut overhead costs and redirect savings towards force structure and modernization. Secretary Gates proposed reallocating funds within the budget to enhance combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support functions, aiming to cut overhead costs and redirect savings towards force structure and modernization. The goal is to convert \"tail\" to \"tooth\" to achieve real growth through sustained root-and-branch changes. Secretary Gates aims to reallocate funds within the budget to enhance combat forces by cutting overhead costs and redirecting savings towards force structure and modernization. The goal is to convert \"tail\" to \"tooth\" to achieve real growth through sustained root-and-branch changes, with a shift of about $10 billion from support functions to combat units providing a total real increase of about 3% in the FY2012 DOD budget. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors and a decrease in the number of generals and admirals. This shift of about $10 billion from support functions to combat units would result in a 3% increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors and a decrease in the number of generals and admirals. This would shift about $10 billion from support functions to combat units, resulting in a 3% increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, a decrease in the number of generals and admirals by 50, and a reduction in the number of senior DOD civilians by 150 over the next two years. Additionally, he announced the elimination of the Joint Forces Command, the Business Transformation Agency, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration. These measures were intended to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, which account for a significant portion of the department's annual spending. Initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services were announced by Secretary Gates, aiming to reduce costs. These initiatives included requiring affordability targets for new systems, contracting revisions to reward efficiency, and changes in rules to lower service contract costs. The Administration's initiatives aim to increase efficiency in DOD contracts by setting affordability targets for new systems, rewarding contractors for efficiency, and reducing service contract costs. Some Members of Congress argue that projected budget increases may not be sufficient given rising personnel and operational costs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about this in February. Some Members of Congress argue that the Administration's projected budget increases for DOD may be inadequate, leading to potential cuts in acquisition programs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about the impact of minimal real growth in the defense budget on investment and procurement accounts. Some Members of Congress are concerned about potential cuts in acquisition programs due to planned budget increases for DOD. Representative Barney Frank calls for reductions in the DOD budget by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and scaling back overseas military deployments. Representative Barney Frank has called for reductions in the DOD budget based on terminating unnecessary weapons programs and scaling back overseas military deployments to address the Administration-imposed budget freeze on discretionary spending. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction scrutiny may lead to devastating cuts in federal programs aimed at improving quality of life. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction scrutiny may lead to devastating cuts in federal programs aimed at improving quality of life. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the steady upward trend since September 11, 2001 attacks. The FY2011 DOD base budget request is 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the steady upward trend since September 11, 2001 attacks. The budget sustains previous initiatives with minimal changes to major weapons programs. The FY2011 DOD budget request maintains previous initiatives with minimal changes to major weapons programs, reflecting the strategy outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) reflects a shift in DOD strategic thinking towards readiness for diverse missions, moving away from Cold War-era conventional wars. Key assumptions in the 2010 QDR are relevant to the Administration's priorities. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for a variety of missions, moving away from Cold War-era strategies. One key assumption is that the top priority for the Department of Defense (DOD) is to win ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, requiring a rebalancing of priorities to support forces engaged in current operations. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) highlights the importance of DOD's focus on winning ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 to support current operations. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recommends increasing funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft to support ongoing counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Longer-term initiatives include converting one heavy Army brigade combat team (BCT) into a Stryker brigade. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends increasing funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with the possibility of converting more in the future. The report assumes that no adversary in the next 10-20 years will directly confront U.S. conventional military capabilities. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends increasing funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It assumes that adversaries in the next 10-20 years will challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically, using unconventional tactics and technologies. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends increasing funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft to prepare for adversaries challenging U.S. forces asymmetrically with unconventional tactics and technologies. The report challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum and highlights how low-end terrorist groups may use advanced technologies while near-peer competitors may employ guerrilla-like \"indirect means\" such as cyber-warfare campaigns. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the importance of military operations in cyberspace, alongside air, sea, and space domains. It calls for strengthening capabilities to defend cyber-networks against advanced technologies and indirect attacks like cyber-warfare campaigns. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review highlights the significance of military operations in cyberspace as a critical domain. It emphasizes the need to enhance capabilities for defending cyber-networks and calls for specific steps such as developing a comprehensive approach, increasing cyber expertise within DOD, centralizing command of cyber operations, and collaborating with other agencies for improved cyber security. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the importance of military operations in cyberspace and calls for specific steps to enhance capabilities, including developing a comprehensive approach, increasing cyber expertise within DOD, centralizing command of cyber operations, and collaborating with other agencies for improved cyber security. The report also maintains the policy of being able to win two major regional wars simultaneously while emphasizing the need for flexibility in responding to multiple missions globally. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review maintains the policy of being able to win two major regional wars simultaneously while emphasizing the need for flexibility in responding to multiple missions globally, including stabilizing other countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency missions, and supporting civil authorities. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review highlights the importance of preparing U.S. forces to handle various missions globally, including stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and supporting civil authorities in times of disaster or terrorist attacks. It also emphasizes the need to address asymmetric threats such as \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities posed by potential adversaries like China. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review focuses on preparing U.S. forces for handling asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities that China and other adversaries are developing. These threats could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, impacting the ability to project power in regions far from the U.S. homeland. China and other potential adversaries are developing technologies to target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, crucial for projecting power in regions far from the U.S. homeland. These capabilities are essential for U.S. alliances and stability efforts in various regions, despite being costly. This is a key reason for the high U.S. defense spending compared to other nations. The cost of power projection capabilities is a key reason for high U.S. defense spending, which exceeds that of any other nation. These capabilities are crucial for U.S. alliances and stability efforts in various regions, but they may be increasingly vulnerable to attack. Overseas ground bases and naval forces, including aircraft carriers, are at risk from advanced technologies like ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and submarines. The U.S. power projection capabilities are crucial for alliances and stability efforts but are increasingly vulnerable to attack. Ground bases and naval forces, including aircraft carriers, are at risk from advanced technologies like ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, submarines, smart mines, and small explosive-laden boats. The QDR recommends strategies to counter anti-access threats. The QDR recommends countering anti-access threats with long-range strike weapons, submarines, and offensive electronic measures to defeat enemy sensors and engagement systems. This includes new manned or unmanned bombers armed with long-range cruise missiles for stand-off attacks. The FY2011 base budget request includes initiatives for anti-access strategies, long-range strike forces, offensive electronic attack capabilities, and missile defense to protect forward deployed forces. The FY2011 base budget request includes initiatives for offensive \"electronic attack\" capabilities, missile defense for protecting forward deployed forces, and funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, representing a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The active-duty end-strength of the military decreased by about one-third in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the start of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army and Marine Corps have rebounded in end-strength numbers. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength in 2010. In response to combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army and Marine Corps end-strength rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength in 2010, with a budget including a $1 billion raise for military personnel effective January 1, 2011. The budget included nearly $1 billion for a 1.4% raise in basic pay for military personnel effective January 1, 2011. The Basic Allowance for Housing was also set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has typically approved military pay raises higher than the average increase in private-sector pay and benefits. The non-taxable cash payment to service members not living in government-provided housing was set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has historically approved military pay raises higher than private-sector increases to address past disparities. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better compensated than 70% of private sector workers with similar experience and responsibility. They suggest that allocating $340 million for a 1.9% raise across-the-board would be more beneficial if spent elsewhere. Military pay increases in the 1980s lagged behind civilian pay hikes. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better paid than 70% of private sector workers with similar experience. Advocacy groups push for a higher increase to close the pay gap. FY2011 DOD funding bills sparked legislative initiatives by supporters and opponents. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals serving in the military under the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Initiatives by supporters and opponents of President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations that bar openly homosexual individuals from military service. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness, while others call for immediate repeal of the 1993 law. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the current policy due to stress from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Two bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to repeal the 1993 law and replace it with a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. President Obama addressed this issue in his January 27, 2010, State of the Union Address. President Obama called for the repeal of the 1993 law and replacing it with a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. Two bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed at this change. The Department of Defense launched a study on implementing this policy change, with Secretary Gates initially opposing the repeal pending the study's completion. In 2010, President Obama called for repealing the 1993 legislation and implementing a nondiscrimination policy for individuals with a same-sex orientation. The Department of Defense conducted a study on how to implement this change, with Secretary Gates initially against the repeal until the study was completed. On March 25, 2010, changes were announced in the enforcement procedures, limiting the authority to investigate and separate individuals for homosexual conduct to high-ranking officers. On March 25, 2010, changes were announced in the Department of Defense's procedures for enforcing the current law on homosexual conduct in the military, limiting the authority to investigate and separate individuals to high-ranking officers. Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. In a letter to President Obama, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, pending completion of the current DOD review and certification from key military officials. The Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military after the current DOD review is completed and key military officials certify that policies are in place for implementation. The Administration preferred congressional action to wait for the DOD study but understands Congress's decision. The Administration supports the draft amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, despite preferring that congressional action wait for the completion of the current DOD study. Defense Secretary Gates believes the review should be finished before any legislation is passed. The Administration supports the draft amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, despite Defense Secretary Gates preferring that the DOD study be completed before legislation is passed. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the 1993 law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010, and enjoined DOD from enforcing it on October 12, 2010. On September 9, 2010, Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' law unconstitutional. On October 12, 2010, Judge Phillips enjoined DOD from enforcing the law. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction on October 19, 2010. On October 19, 2010, the Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed Judge Phillips' injunction against the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Act. Two days later, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel Clifford Stanley limited the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior to five senior DOD officials. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, serving 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through 56 hospitals and 363 out-patient medical facilities. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, which serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through hospitals, out-patient medical facilities, and dental clinics. The cost of the medical program is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The DOD health care system serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through hospitals, medical facilities, and dental clinics. The cost has more than doubled in the past 10 years, projected to increase annually at 5-7% through FY2015, accounting for 10% of the planned DOD budget. Factors contributing to the cost increase include more retirees using TRICARE insurance and advancements in medical technology. The steady increase in military health care costs is attributed to factors such as more retirees using TRICARE insurance, increased frequency of eligible beneficiaries using DOD medical services, legislatively mandated benefit increases, and no fee adjustments since 1995. The Bush Administration's DOD budget requests for FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009 aimed to address these rising costs. The Bush Administration's DOD budget requests for FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009 proposed increasing fees and copayments for TRICARE beneficiaries, but Congress passed legislation to prohibit these fee hikes. The Obama Administration's 2011 budget did not include any proposals to raise TRICARE fees or copayments. The Bush Administration proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries in FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009, but Congress blocked these proposals. The Obama Administration did not include any fee hike proposals in the 2011 budget. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control TRICARE costs while ensuring care for military personnel and retirees. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control TRICARE costs while ensuring care for military personnel and retirees. The FY2011 request aimed to increase the total amount for development and procurement of weapons and equipment. The FY2011 budget request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift towards production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Total funding would increase from $184.9 billion to $189.0 billion, with a higher proportion allocated to procurement and a lower proportion to research and development. The FY2011 budget request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift towards production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The total DOD budget dedicated to procurement would increase from 56% to 60%, while the proportion going to R&D would decline from 44% to 40%. The F-35 program received $11.2 billion in FY2010, with $4.0 billion for R&D and $7.2 billion for procurement. In FY2011, the total budget request was $11.2 billion, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The FY2011 budget request included $11.2 billion, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The Administration proposed cuts in major weapons programs, including no funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate jet engine for the F-35. The FY2011 budget request did not include funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate jet engine for the F-35, which Congress had added funding for in 2009. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, for which $3.2 billion was requested by the Administration. In FY2010, Congress allocated $2.5 billion for 10 C-17s and $465 million for an alternate engine. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which aims to develop new ground combat equipment, including the controversial Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). This program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program. The Brigade Combat Team Modernization program aims to develop new ground combat equipment, including the controversial Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), which replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program. The FCS program was intended to develop a new generation of combat equipment to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and the M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. In 2009, efforts to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems tied together by an extensive communications and information network were underway, but the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component was recommended for cancellation by Secretary of Defense Gates. In 2009, efforts to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems tied together by an extensive communications and information network were underway as part of the Future Combat System (FCS) program. However, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component due to significant design strategy concerns and a lack of reflection of lessons from counterinsurgency and close-quarters combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army canceled the MGV component of the Future Combat System program due to design concerns and lack of reflection on lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, they launched the GCV program to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. Congress may question if the Army is rushing the development of the GCV, risking potential issues. The Army canceled the MGV component of the Future Combat System program and launched the GCV program to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. Congress may question if the Army is rushing the development of the GCV, risking potential issues. The Army canceled the MGV component of the Future Combat System program and launched the GCV program to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. The Army restarted the GCV competition on November 30, 2010, incorporating elements of the FCS program into the Army's Modernization program. The Army restarted the GCV competition on November 30, 2010, incorporating elements of the FCS program into the Army's Modernization program. The FCS components planned for deployment have not demonstrated effectiveness in field exercises. The Army's Modernization program plans to deploy FCS components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, such as submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested funding for nine new battle force ships, including submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The five-year shipbuilding plan aims to add 50 new battle force ships, with half being LCSs or JHSVs. The 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships but may not fully support all elements. The Navy's five-year shipbuilding plan aims to add 50 new battle force ships, with half being LCSs or JHSVs. The 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships but may not fully support all elements. The Navy projects a fleet growth from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to reach 320 ships by FY2024 but may not fully support all elements, with projected drops below required levels for attack submarines and cruiser-destroyer forces in later years. The plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to increase to 301 ships by FY2039-FY2040. The plan projects drops below required levels for attack submarines and cruiser-destroyer forces in later years. The Navy estimates an average of $15.9 billion per year, while a CBO report suggests $19.0 billion per year, about 18% more. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to increase to 301 ships by FY2039-FY2040. A May 2010 CBO report estimates the plan would require $19.0 billion per year, 18% more than Navy estimates. Specific shipbuilding issues discussed include development of next-generation ballistic missile submarines. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to increase to 301 ships by FY2039-FY2040, requiring an average of about $15 billion a year in 2010 dollars. Specific shipbuilding issues discussed include the development of next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as the SSBN(X) program, to replace the Ohio-class submarines. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested additional funding for research and development of the SSBN(X) program. The Navy plans to procure SSBN(X) submarines as replacements for the Ohio-class submarines. The program received funding in the Navy's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets for research and development. The first SSBN(X) is expected to be procured in FY2019, with an estimated cost of $6 billion to $7 billion each. The Navy plans to procure SSBN(X) submarines as replacements for the Ohio-class submarines, with an estimated cost of $6 billion to $7 billion each. An additional $672.3 million in research and development funding has been allocated for the program. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of the long-term shipbuilding program due to the procurement of 12 SSBN(X)s during the 15-year period FY2019-FY2033. The Navy's plan to procure 12 SSBN(X) submarines could strain the budget for new ships, limiting the procurement rates for other ship classes during the 15-year period FY2019-FY2033. This could impact the affordability of the long-term shipbuilding program. The Navy's plan to procure 12 SSBN(X) submarines may lead to reductions in procurement rates for other Navy ships during FY2019-FY2033. Options to reduce costs include procuring fewer SSBN(X)s or carrying fewer submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer submarines, carrying fewer ballistic missiles, designing smaller missiles, stretching out procurement schedules, using split funding, funding from a different DOD budget, or increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The Navy is considering options to reduce the cost of the SSBN(X) program, such as designing the submarines to carry smaller missiles, stretching out procurement schedules, using split funding, and funding from a different DOD budget. Congress supported ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. The Navy's FY2010 budget proposed ending Zumwalt class destroyer procurement and resuming Arleigh Burke class destroyer procurement. Congress supported this proposal. The FY2011 budget calls for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The budget also proposes terminating the CG(X) cruiser program and building an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The budget also suggested terminating the CG(X) cruiser program and building an improved version of the DDG-51, known as the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) originally planned for the CG(X). The Navy plans to procure the Flight III version of the DDG-51 starting in FY2016, with a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). The proposed FY2011 budget includes funding for the AMDR and the Aegis ballistic missile defense program. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget includes $228.4 million for the AMDR, a key component of the Aegis ballistic missile defense program. The plan is to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015, raising concerns about the use of Aegis-BMD ships to defend Europe against potential ballistic missile attacks. The number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is set to increase from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns arise over the growing demands for these ships, especially with plans to use them for defending Europe against ballistic missile attacks. There are worries that the Navy's ability to provide Aegis ships for non-BMD missions may be strained. Demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships are outpacing the supply, raising concerns about strain on the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. The Aegis BMD program is mainly funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. In FY2011, MDA requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program, while the Navy requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. Congress faced issues regarding funding allocation for BMD programs. The Aegis BMD program is funded through MDA's budget and additional funding from the Navy. In FY2011, MDA requested $2,161.6 million for the program, while the Navy requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. Congress faced decisions on funding allocation for BMD programs. In FY2011, Congress had to decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Navy's proposal for the Flight III DDG-51 design and Aegis BMD program funding. The budget requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships out of a planned force of 55. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) out of a planned force of 55. The LCS are small vessels designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy planned to buy different versions from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one design for the fleet. The Navy planned to buy different versions of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one design for the fleet. The Navy accelerated its timetable for choosing between the two designs, opting to select a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and subsequent years. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period at a rate of two ships per year. The Navy accelerated its timetable for choosing between two designs, announcing a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and beyond. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition for up to five additional LCSs to the same design in FY2012-FY2014. The Navy announced a second competition to select a second shipyard to build up to five additional LCSs to the same design in FY2012-FY2014. Navy officials sought approval to buy 10 ships from each of the competing industry teams. Fighter aircraft are a significant component of U.S. military capability and defense spending. In 2010, Navy officials sought approval from Congress to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team as part of a new acquisition strategy. Fighter aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and defense spending, with concerns about the shortage of planes due to budget constraints on replacement fighters. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortages due to budget constraints on replacement planes. Air Force officials projected a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a peak shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft. In 2008, officials projected a significant fighter aircraft shortfall for the Air Force and Navy by 2024. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing tactical aircraft, with predictions of a budget \"train wreck\" looming. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is a key component in this issue. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is crucial for the modernization of the tactical aircraft force, with plans to acquire 2,443 JSFs at an estimated cost of $238 billion in constant FY2002 dollars. Concerns about budget constraints have been raised in Congress and elsewhere, with predictions of a potential funding shortfall. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is the largest weapon procurement program for the Department of Defense, with plans to acquire 2,443 JSFs at a cost of over $300 billion. Several U.S. allies are also purchasing additional F-35s. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35. The F-35 program is the largest weapon procurement program for the Department of Defense, with plans to acquire over 2,400 JSFs at a cost of more than $300 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program, including funding for research and development, as well as procurement. Some observers are concerned about the affordability of the F-35 in situations of constrained DOD resources. The F-35 program received $11.3 billion in funding, with $2.5 billion for research and development and $8.8 billion for procurement. Concerns arise about affordability in the face of limited DOD resources, especially as production rates increase. The F-35 program may not be affordable in the annual quantities planned by DOD without reducing funding for other programs. As production rates increase, the program will require over $10 billion per year in acquisition funding, posing budgetary challenges for DOD. The British government announced plans to reduce defense spending, highlighting concerns about the program's cost-effectiveness. The F-35 program, considered relatively affordable for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, faces budget challenges. The British government plans to reduce their purchase from 138 to as few as 40 planes, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. The British government plans to reduce its defense spending by buying as few as 40 F-35 planes, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program to develop an alternative engine for the F-35. The U.S. Marine Corps has been developing the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program, despite the Administration's attempts to do so. Approximately $2.5 billion has been provided for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional $2.9 billion needed to complete the development by 2017. The Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine program has received $2.5 billion from Congress, with an additional $2.9 billion needed for the F136 engine development. Critics argue that the proposal to terminate the program was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. Critics of the proposal to terminate the F136 alternate engine argue that budget pressures, not long-term considerations, drove the decision. They believe engine competition saved money and increased reliability, while supporters of termination argue single-source contracts are more common and lead to long-term affordability. Critics of terminating the F136 alternate engine argue that engine competition on the F-15 and F-16 programs saved money and increased reliability. They believe long-term engine affordability is best achieved through multiyear contracts from a single source. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, potential impact on the defense industrial base, and U.S. relations with allied countries. Terminating the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and U.S. relations with allied countries. It also eliminates competitive market forces for DOD business, raising challenges for cost control in a single-supplier environment. Continuing F136 development raises issues for the F-35 acquisition. Continuing F136 development raises concerns about impact on the F-35 acquisition program, potential reduction in the number of F-35s acquired, outyear costs, and operational challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million for the program. The F136 development raises concerns about its impact on the F-35 acquisition program, potential reduction in the number of F-35s acquired, outyear costs, and operational challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million for the program. The proposed FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million for the Air Force's third attempt to acquire new mid-air refueling tankers, KC-X, to replace aging KC-135 tankers. The competition involved Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS offering tanker options based on their respective jetliners. The DOD released a Request for Proposals to build 179 new KC-X tankers. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, with Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS competing with tanker options based on their jetliners.

The Obama Administration dropped the plan to deploy a modified version of the land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic in favor of the Phased Adaptive Approach. The Obama Administration replaced the plan to deploy a modified land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic with the Phased Adaptive Approach, using BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. Similar BMD capabilities could be pursued in other regions like the Middle East and Northeast Asia. The Obama Administration's Phased Adaptive Approach involves using Aegis ships to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. $2.27 billion was requested in FY2011 for programs associated with the PAA, including development efforts unique to PAA and procurement of the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. In FY2011, the Administration requested $2.27 billion for programs related to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA), including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a reduction to $18.7 billion, mainly due to decreased spending on new facilities for units relocating from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing requested $18.7 billion, a 20% decrease from FY2010. The reduction is mainly due to decreased spending on new facilities for units relocating from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Military family housing budget also decreased from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion in the FY2011 request. The FY2011 military construction budget decreased by 20% from FY2010, mainly due to reduced spending on facilities for units relocating from the 2005 BRAC Commission. The budget for military family housing also dropped from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion in the FY2011 request, attributed to privatization of military housing and increased Basic Allowance for Housing payments. The FY2011 DOD bills provided a vehicle for Members of Congress opposed to the Navy's plan to move a nuclear powered aircraft carrier from Norfolk, VA to Mayport, FL, as a result of privatizing military family housing and increased Basic Allowance for Housing payments. The FY2011 DOD bills allowed Members of Congress to oppose the Navy's plan to move a nuclear powered aircraft carrier from Norfolk, VA to Mayport, FL. The Department of Defense endorsed the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port for security reasons. The Department of Defense supports the Navy's plan to establish Mayport, FL as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port for security reasons. This move would require new nuclear support facilities to be built in Mayport. The U.S. Navy plans to homeport an East Coast carrier in Mayport, Florida, requiring new nuclear support facilities. This move would shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport, with support from certain Members of Congress and benefits in mitigating risks to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet. Certain Members of Congress from Florida support homeporting an aircraft carrier at Mayport, citing benefits in mitigating risks to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet. The Navy estimates the total cost of moving a CVN to Mayport at $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging approved by Congress in the FY2010 DOD budget. The Navy estimates the total cost of moving a CVN to Mayport at $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging approved by Congress in the FY2010 DOD budget.

The move is the result of negotiations between the US, Japan, and DOD, with additional military personnel expected to relocate to Guam from the US by 2014-2016. Guam, a mountainous island with a population of about 178,000, will see a permanent increase in population due to these relocations. The Government of Japan and DOD plan to relocate military personnel to Guam from the United States by 2014-2016. Guam, a mountainous island with a population of about 178,000, is expected to see a permanent increase in population due to the influx of military personnel, their families, DOD personnel, and supporting contractors. Estimates suggest up to 56,000 permanent residents and 25,000 temporary workers may be needed for the planned facilities. The planned influx of military personnel, their families, DOD personnel, and supporting contractors could lead to a permanent increase in Guam's population of up to 56,000. Analysts question if the island's infrastructure can support this surge. The U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) is being created to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. The Administration's budget supported the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. Analysts question if Guam's infrastructure can support the planned influx of military personnel and their families. The reorganization of cyber forces in 2008 integrated offensive and defensive cyber operations under one organization, marking a departure from historical segregation. This consolidation was directed by Secretary Gates to enhance DOD's cyber capabilities. In 2009, Secretary Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command, integrating offensive and defensive cyber operations. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command while retaining the NSA directorship.

They also requested assessments on how the Navy's plans would impact the Marine Corps's ability to conduct amphibious landings, with a focus on the number of amphibious landing ships needed. The Senate committee raised concerns about the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class, citing potential cost increases and construction delays that could hinder reaching the goal of 33 amphibious ships needed for two brigade-sized assault landings. Construction delays may hinder reaching the goal of 33 amphibious ships. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace Ohio-class submarines with the expensive SSBN(X) submarines, which could impact future shipbuilding budgets. The authorization bill versions would have approved $672.3 million for SSBN(X). The expensive SSBN(X) submarines are expected to absorb a large share of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016, potentially crowding out the construction of other planned ships.
