The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with subsection (f) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amended to add new paragraphs for further adjustments based on regional cost-of-living. The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with subsection (f) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amended to add new paragraphs for further adjustments based on regional cost-of-living. In general, the rate table for an individual's taxable year is adjusted as provided in subparagraph (B), which outlines the method of making regional adjustments to the rate table. The rate table for an individual's taxable year is adjusted by multiplying the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket by an applicable multiplier based on the statistical area where the individual resides. The tax rate table for an individual's taxable year is adjusted by multiplying the dollar amounts for each rate bracket by an applicable multiplier based on the statistical area of the individual's primary residence. The tax rate applicable to each bracket remains unchanged, and the tax amount is adjusted as needed. The tax rate table is adjusted by multiplying dollar amounts for each bracket by an applicable multiplier based on the individual's primary residence area. The rate for each bracket remains unchanged, and the tax amount is adjusted accordingly. If the amount is not a multiple of $50, it is rounded to the nearest multiple. Determination of multipliers must be done by December 15. The Secretary determines applicable multipliers for each statistical area of the United States annually, which are used to adjust the tax rate brackets. Amounts not multiples of $50 are rounded to the nearest multiple. The Secretary annually prescribes applicable multipliers for each statistical area of the United States to adjust tax rate brackets. The multiplier for areas with a cost-of-living differential over 125% is set at 90% of the differential. For statistical areas with a cost-of-living differential over 125%, the applicable multiplier is 90% of the differential. For areas with a differential between 97% and 125%, the multiplier is 1.05. The applicable multiplier for statistical areas with a cost-of-living differential over 125% is 90 percent of the differential. For areas with a differential between 97% and 125%, the multiplier is 1.05. The cost-of-living differential for any statistical area for a calendar year is determined by dividing the cost-of-living for the area in the preceding year by the average cost-of-living. The cost-of-living differential for any statistical area for a calendar year is calculated by dividing the area's cost-of-living in the previous year by the average cost-of-living in the United States. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes a cost-of-living index for each statistical area annually based on average market prices. The cost-of-living index for any statistical area in a calendar year is based on average market prices for the area over a 12-month period ending on August 31, using the same methodology as the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The cost-of-living index for a statistical area in a calendar year is determined based on market prices using the same methodology as the Consumer Price Index. The term 'statistical area' includes metropolitan statistical areas defined by the Secretary of Commerce and portions of states not within those areas. The cost-of-living index for a statistical area is determined based on market prices using the same methodology as the Consumer Price Index. A statistical area includes metropolitan statistical areas defined by the Secretary of Commerce and portions of states not within those areas. The area applicable multiplier for any area outside the United States is 1. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009, with a transition rule for 2010. The area applicable multiplier for areas outside the United States is 1. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009, with a transition rule for 2010. The date for prescribing applicable multipliers for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2010 shall be 1 year after the enactment of this Act."
