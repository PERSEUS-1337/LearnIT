A feed forward network (FFN) consists of 3 or more layers with artificial neurons. The layers include input, hidden, and output layers. The number of hidden layers can be increased for complex data, with the complexity determining the parameterization of the network. The units form an acyclic graph that passes information in a forward direction without depending on past input. The computation of each hidden layer in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can be mathematically formulated. Rectified linear units (ReLU) have been found to be more efficient in accelerating the training process in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with hidden layers. The computation of each hidden layer in the network can be mathematically formulated. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are efficient in accelerating training in multi-layer perceptrons with hidden layers. They outperform traditional activation functions like logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions due to their speed and advantages in training vast amounts of data. ReLU is more efficient for training large amounts of data, speeding up the process compared to traditional activation functions like logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent.
