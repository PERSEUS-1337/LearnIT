    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products can be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet the requirements of this article. The amendment to Section 399.16 allows for the procurement of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources based on project viability principles and benefits criteria. The amendment to Section 399.16 allows for the procurement of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources in California, with specific criteria for interconnection and scheduling requirements. Unbundled renewable energy credits can be earned by electricity generated by an entity excluded from being an electrical corporation, meeting specific criteria, and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The renewable energy credit can be earned by electricity generated at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity, meeting specific criteria. The renewable energy credit can be earned by electricity generated at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity, meeting specific criteria such as the generating capability being put into service on or after January 1, 2016. This includes new generation or incremental increases resulting from capital investment or operational changes made to the facility. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period, including firmed and shaped eligible renewable energy resource electricity products scheduled into a California balancing authority. Additionally, any electricity generated that does not qualify under the criteria mentioned should also be considered for a balanced portfolio. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period, including a certain percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period, including a minimum percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. The percentages vary based on the compliance period, with higher requirements in later years. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period, including a minimum percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. For contracts executed after June 1, 2010, limits are set on the percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products that must meet certain content requirements, with decreasing percentages over time. Any renewable energy contracts executed after June 1, 2010, must meet product content requirements. Restrictions on crediting renewable energy products apply to contracts after January 13, 2011. Contracts before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if specific conditions are met. Any contract or ownership agreement executed before June 1, 2010, counts towards procurement requirements if the renewable energy resource was eligible at the time of execution and approved by the commission for electrical corporations. The renewable energy resource must be eligible and approved by the commission for electrical corporations. Contract amendments after June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change the resource. Contract duration can be extended if the original commitment was 15 years or more. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements from the commission if they cannot comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can lower the requirement but not below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. The electricity generated by a public entity and sold as renewable energy credits must be included in the total retail sales of the buyer for renewables portfolio standard calculations."
