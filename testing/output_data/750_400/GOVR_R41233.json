    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants. HUD's rental assistance programs, including Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance, receive the majority of non-emergency funding. Block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Specialized grant programs also address the needs of homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD's programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants assist communities in financing housing and community development activities for low-income families. Specialized grant programs also cater to homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings, using fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus funds from FHA have been utilized to support the HUD budget. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus funds from FHA have been used to support the HUD budget, including emergency supplemental funding for recovery assistance after natural disasters. The HUD budget has received significant emergency supplemental funding in recent years, including $20 billion for recovery assistance after Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes in 2005. The economic stimulus legislation provided over $13 billion to HUD's programs. Regular funding for HUD has increased by 57% in the past nine years. Table 1 shows HUD's total enacted appropriations over the past five years, with regular funding increasing by 57% in the last nine years. The growth rate has been on the rise in recent years, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more, peaking at nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the real funding growth has been less robust. In recent years, HUD's budget growth rate has increased significantly, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year, peaking at nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the real funding growth has been less robust, growing by about 17% over a nine-year period. Most of the growth in the last nine years has occurred in the last two years. HUD's funding is composed of several components. HUD's budget growth over the nine-year period, adjusted for inflation, was about 17%. The year-over-year growth never exceeded 3.5% until the last two years, with some years showing declines. HUD's funding consists of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets, with programs funded mainly through discretionary appropriations. HUD's annual funding includes regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Programs and activities are funded through regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations. Emergency appropriations are provided by Congress in response to disasters, outside of regular appropriations acts. Congress provides annual appropriations for HUD programs and activities, with additional emergency appropriations sometimes allocated in response to disasters. These emergency funds are separate from regular appropriations and are subject to limits on new discretionary funding. Congressional appropriators may adjust regular annual appropriations to stay within these limits. Congressional appropriators for HUD programs may offset regular annual appropriations through rescissions and offsetting receipts, derived from fees paid by HUD partners. The cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts, derived from fees paid by HUD partners. This interaction determines HUD's total net budget authority, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The total net budget authority of HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations, rescissions, receipts, and collections. This net budget authority is the \"cost\" of the HUD budget estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. However, the total amount of net budget authority provided to HUD each year may not accurately reflect the funding for HUD's programs and activities due to the role of offsets. Declining or increasing net budget authority does not necessarily mean a decrease or increase in regular appropriations. The net budget authority provided to HUD each year may not accurately reflect the funding for its programs and activities due to offsets. Despite a 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010, this masks important trends. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion. However, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during the same period. The 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority for HUD from FY2002 to FY2010 is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during this period, while offsetting receipts and collections declined significantly. The amount available in offsetting receipts and collections and the amount rescinded declined significantly, leading to a 70% and 96% decrease, respectively. This contributed to the increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002-FY2010. The 37% growth in regular appropriations during this period is mainly due to the expansion of HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs. The 37% growth in regular appropriations from FY2002 to FY2010 is largely due to the expansion of HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which are the largest components of the HUD budget. Appropriations for the Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, while funding for all other HUD programs only grew by 8% during this period. Appropriations for the Section 8 programs grew by over 70% from FY2002 to FY2010, accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. In FY2002, Section 8 program appropriations grew by over 70%, representing 57% of HUD's total appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs started to increase in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts, mainly from FHA mortgage insurance programs, decreased from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs, from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010, has significantly impacted HUD's appropriations process. The annual appropriations process typically begins with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Legislation must be enacted before September 30 to align with the federal fiscal year. The appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Legislation must be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. In cases of delays, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted to maintain funding at prior levels. The FY2011 appropriations process began with these steps. The FY2011 appropriations process began with the President's budget request on February 1, 2010, and concluded with the signing of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. The process spanned two calendar years and two Congresses, with short-term continuing resolutions enacted to avoid a government funding lapse. The FY2011 appropriations process started with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010, and ended with the signing of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. It spanned two calendar years and two Congresses. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 1% decrease from FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 1% from FY2010. This decrease in budget authority would actually represent a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The budget proposed to offset the increase in appropriations with a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts. The President's FY2011 budget requested a decrease in net new budget authority for HUD, which would actually result in a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The budget proposed offsetting the increase with a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts, with the largest funding increases requested for Section 8 programs, programs for the homeless, and HUD's research and technology needs. The President's FY2011 budget requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, programs for the homeless, and HUD's research and technology needs. Decreased funding was requested for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing capital repairs. No new funding was requested for the brownfields redevelopment program. The President's budget requested decreased funding for programs providing housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities, as well as public housing capital repairs. No new funding was requested for the brownfields redevelopment program. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President, resulting in a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The House approved a HUD funding bill (H.R. 5850) on July 29, 2010, providing $1 billion more than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. Additionally, funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance was also rejected. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate also rejected the President's proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. They also rejected funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The Senate bill, like the House bill, would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill that would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The Senate bill for FY2011 HUD funding included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The bill also provided funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The Senate committee bill for FY2011 HUD funding included funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels. During the 111th Congress, a series of continuing resolutions were enacted to maintain funding at FY2010 levels for most federal budget accounts, including HUD's budget. The last CR approved before adjournment was set to expire on March 4, 2011, or upon enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation, leaving funding for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. During the 111th Congress, continuing resolutions extended funding for HUD programs and FHA mortgage limits through FY2011. The last CR approved before adjournment was set to expire on March 4, 2011, leaving funding for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress extended funding for HUD programs and FHA mortgage limits through FY2011. A year-long continuing resolution proposed funding many HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but cutting others, resulting in $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed funding HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but cutting others, resulting in $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment to H.R. 1, which would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion and represented a reduction in net budget authority from FY2010. The Senate considered, but did not pass, both H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment to H.R. 1 (S.Amdt. 149). The amendment would have increased funding for HUD by almost $6 billion, with a reduction in net budget authority from FY2010. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, with most accounts funded at FY2010 levels. However, funding for some accounts was reduced below FY2010 levels, with only the Community Development Fund (CDF) account for HUD being affected. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011. Funding for most accounts was maintained at FY2010 levels, but the Community Development Fund (CDF) for HUD saw a reduction, specifically for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The CDF was funded approximately $195 million lower than the FY2010 level, equivalent to the amount previously allocated for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood. The CDF account, funding the CDBG program, was reduced by approximately $195 million under H.J.Res. 44. This reduction eliminated funding for congressional earmarks through EDI and NI in FY2010. Congress then passed another short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48) maintaining most HUD account funding at FY2010 levels but continuing the CDF funding reduction. In FY2010, Congress enacted short-term CRs (H.J.Res. 44 and H.J.Res. 48) to continue funding for HUD accounts. H.J.Res. 48 did not provide funding for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account, which was funded at $17 million in FY2010. A final short-term CR, P.L. 112-8, extended funding through April 15, 2011, while work on a final FY2011 funding bill was completed. The final short-term CR, P.L. 112-8, extended funding through April 15, 2011, while work on a final FY2011 year-long funding bill was completed. It reduced funding for the public housing operating fund and specified that no CDF funds could be used for EDI and NI earmarks. On April 15, 2011, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 was signed into law (P.L. 112-10), providing year-long FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Defense and other government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for the two Section 8 programs. The act also included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from all non-defense discretionary accounts, including those in HUD's budget. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD. It funded some programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for others, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The act also included a 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a $41.1 billion net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 11% from FY2010. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD, with a $41.1 billion net new budget authority, representing an 11% decrease from FY2010 levels. This decrease in budget authority would only result in a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to increased offsetting collections and receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The FHA insures mortgage loans for eligible borrowers who pay upfront and monthly fees for the insurance. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) saw an increase in offsetting collections and receipts from its mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures loans for eligible borrowers, who pay upfront and monthly fees for the insurance, making mortgage credit more accessible and affordable. FHA's home loan insurance programs are primarily administered through two accounts in the HUD budget. The FHA provides insurance for mortgage loans, making credit more accessible and affordable. The insurance programs are administered through two accounts in the HUD budget, the MMI/CMHI and GI/SRI funds. The MMI Fund is the largest and is usually associated with single-family home loans. The FHA insurance funds include the Management Housing Insurance Fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI). The MMI Fund is the largest and is mainly associated with single-family home loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program into the MMI Fund, creating two risk categories within the fund. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the FHA's reverse mortgage program into the MMI Fund, creating two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. This section focuses on single-family loans insured under the MMI Fund. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans such as hospitals and nursing homes. This section discusses single-family loans insured under the MMI Fund. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 determines the cost of federal loan insurance based on expected cash flows. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) calculates the cost of federal loan insurance by considering the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows come from insurance premiums paid by borrowers, while cash outflows are payments to lenders for loan defaults. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume, represents the net value of these cash flows. The subsidy rate is calculated as the net present value of cash flows from insured loans, with cash inflows from insurance premiums and outflows from payments for loan defaults. It is expressed as a percentage of the loan volume, with a negative rate indicating excess inflows and a positive rate indicating excess outflows. The subsidy rate is calculated based on cash inflows and outflows from insured loans, expressed as a percentage of the loan volume. A negative rate indicates excess inflows, while a positive rate indicates excess outflows. This rate is applied to the expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed for a federal credit program. Actual cash flows over the life of the loans may differ from initial projections. The subsidy rate is applied to the expected loan volume to calculate the credit subsidy needed for a federal credit program. Agencies must periodically revise initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically had a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy to offset other program funding needs in the HUD budget. The MMI Fund historically had a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy to offset other program funding needs in the HUD budget. This means the fund has made more money in fees than it has paid out in claims, not requiring an appropriation from Congress to operate. The MMI Fund historically had a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy to offset other program funding needs in the HUD budget. It has made more money in fees than paid out in claims, not needing an appropriation from Congress to operate. The MMI Fund is divided into the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category and the MMI HECM risk category. The Purchase and Refinance risk category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011. The MMI Fund is divided into two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The Purchase and Refinance category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. The Administration estimated a negative subsidy rate of -0.62% for FY2010, projecting $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy for the MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category in FY2011. This increase in negative credit subsidy is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy for the Purchase and Refinance risk category compared to the Administration's estimate. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy for the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category, estimating around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy with proposed FHA reforms by HUD. CBO projected a $1.9 billion negative credit subsidy for FHA's Purchase and Refinance risk category, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD reforms. Despite lower projections than the Administration, CBO still expected this category to generate more revenue than losses in FY2011. The differences between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate are detailed in Table 3. CBO projected a positive credit subsidy for the MMI Fund in FY2011, with differences in offsetting receipts between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate. FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy for FY2011 were revised upward due to an increase in annual premiums that went into effect in April 2011. This was highlighted in the President's FY2012 budget request. The FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy for FY2011 were revised upward due to an increase in annual premiums that went into effect in April 2011, resulting in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category. This led to an increase in offsetting receipts for the Purchase and Refinance risk category in FY2011. The FHA's annual premium increase in April 2011 resulted in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category, leading to nearly $10 billion in offsetting receipts for FY2011. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts by over $1 billion during the FY2011 appropriations process. The FHA's category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released, from an estimate of $5.8 billion when the FY2011 budget was released. CBO also increased its estimate of FHA receipts for FY2011 by over $1 billion. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund separately. The MMI HECM risk category is estimated to have a positive credit subsidy of 0.83%. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program into the MMI fund separately. The MMI HECM risk category is estimated to have a positive credit subsidy of 0.83% and will require an appropriation of $250 million. HUD proposed to increase HECM borrowers' annual insurance premiums in FY2011. In FY2011, HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies. This included increasing borrowers' annual insurance premiums and adjusting the formula for loan sizes. H.R. 5850 would have provided $140 million in credit subsidies. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program in FY2011, including increasing borrowers' insurance premiums and adjusting the loan size formula. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 would have provided less credit subsidies than the Administration's estimate. The final FY2012 appropriations law continued directives for HUD to make adjustments to the HECM program. The final FY2012 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) directed HUD to adjust the HECM program to result in zero credit subsidy. Demand for FHA-insured mortgages has increased as private lending standards tighten. FHA insured 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. The HECM program is being adjusted to have a zero credit subsidy, eliminating the need for appropriations. Demand for FHA-insured mortgages has risen as private lending standards tighten, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from 2% in FY2006. The increase in FHA-insured mortgages leads to higher mortgage insurance premiums paid into the MMI Fund, reflecting a better credit quality in the newer mortgages insured by FHA. The FHA-insured mortgages have increased to 18.7% in FY2009 from 2% in FY2006, leading to higher premiums paid into the MMI Fund. The average credit score on these loans has improved, but the default rate on past loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund's capital reserve ratio requirement. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that the MMI Fund must have a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% within 10 years. The capital reserve ratio is a measure of FHA's resources to cover unexpected losses. In FY2009, the capital reserve ratio was estimated to be 0.53%, the first time it fell below the required level. The capital reserve ratio for the MMI Fund must be maintained at a minimum of 2%, but in FY2009, it fell to 0.53%. FHA has proposed changes to its mortgage insurance programs to address concerns over financial stability, some of which require congressional action. The capital reserve ratio fell below 2%, prompting FHA to propose changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs. These changes include increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium, with some requiring congressional action. FHA proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. The maximum annual insurance premium amounts were set by Congress at 1.5% for borrowers with downpayments greater than 5% and 1.55% for borrowers with downpayments of 5% or less. FHA then increased the annual mortgage insurance premiums charged based on loan-to-value ratios. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums to 0.9% for loan-to-value ratios of 95% or higher and 0.85% for ratios below 95%. Subsequently, on April 18, 2011, FHA raised premiums to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. Congress also mandated an increase in the upfront mortgage insurance premium. Beginning on October 4, 2010, FHA increased annual insurance premiums to 0.85% of the loan balance for loan-to-value ratios below 95%. On April 18, 2011, the premiums were raised again to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. The upfront mortgage insurance premium was also increased to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, staying below the statutory cap of 3%. FHA increased annual insurance premiums to 0.85% for loan-to-value ratios below 95% on October 4, 2010. The premiums were raised again on April 18, 2011, to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. The upfront mortgage insurance premium was also increased to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, below the statutory cap of 3%. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA lowered the upfront premium to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA raised annual mortgage insurance premiums and lowered upfront premiums for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. FHA also proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, with borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579 needing a 10% downpayment, while those with scores of 580 or above would still require a 3.5% downpayment. FHA proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements on loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. Borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579 would need a 10% downpayment, while those with scores of 580 or above would still require a 3.5% downpayment. FHA also proposed reducing the maximum limit on seller concessions from 6% to 3%. FHA intends to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders and reduce seller concessions from 6% to 3%. These changes can be made administratively. FHA intends to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders and enforce requirements through administrative changes and potential additional enforcement actions granted by Congress. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to give FHA authority to require lenders to indemnify FHA for claims on mortgages not properly underwritten. FHA seeks more oversight and enforcement powers, including the ability to require lenders to indemnify FHA for claims on non-compliant mortgages. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to grant FHA broader authority to terminate lenders with high default rates and establish a Deputy Assistant position within FHA. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to give FHA more authority to terminate lenders with high default rates and establish a Deputy Assistant position for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA. It also included provisions for outside credit risk analysis sources and abolishing the position of FHA chief risk officer. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to give FHA more authority by establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs. This would abolish the current position of FHA chief risk officer and allow FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. Appropriations were authorized for staff to review lender performance from FY2010 through FY2014. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs to nonprofit developers for building or rehabilitating housing units for elderly and disabled residents. Supportive services are optional in the Section 202 program but mandatory in the Section 811 program. HUD capital grants have funded over 106,000 units. HUD provides capital grants to nonprofit developers for building or rehabilitating housing units for elderly and disabled residents. Supportive services are optional in the Section 202 program but mandatory in the Section 811 program. Over 106,000 units have been funded through HUD capital grants. The President proposed no new funding for Section 202 or Section 811 housing in FY2011 to allow time for program redesign. In FY2011, the President proposed no new funding for Section 202 or Section 811 housing to allow for program redesign, which would result in reduced funding for both programs. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million. The President's FY2011 proposal would have reduced funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing programs. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million, while Section 811 would have received $90 million. Neither the House-passed appropriations bill nor the Senate committee-passed bill followed the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. In FY2011, Section 202 housing programs would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million in FY2011, compared to $300 million in FY2010. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. The proposed funding levels for Section 202 and Section 811 differed between the two bills. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed maintaining funding levels for Section 202 at $825 million from FY2010. For the Section 811 program, H.R. 5850 allocated $300 million, while S. 3644 allocated $200 million, with differences in funding based on the treatment of Section 811 vouchers. Both bills would move funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. The proposed funding levels for Section 811 vouchers were to be moved to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account in both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644. The Senate Appropriations Committee report noted a $100 million reduction in funding for the Section 811 account due to this change. Congress ultimately allocated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs in FY2011. In FY2011, $114 million would renew vouchers, with $100 million less for Section 811 due to changes. Congress allocated $400 million for Section 202 and $150 million for Section 811, split between accounts. Up to $32 million was available to renew pre-2007 voucher contracts. In FY2011, $114 million was allocated to renew vouchers, with $100 million less for Section 811 due to changes. Congress allocated $400 million for Section 202 and $150 million for Section 811, split between accounts. Up to $32 million was available to renew pre-2007 voucher contracts. Within the funds for Section 202, approximately $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators. In FY2011, $114 million was allocated to renew vouchers, with $100 million less for Section 811 due to changes. Congress allocated $400 million for Section 202 and $150 million for Section 811, split between accounts. Up to $32 million was available to renew pre-2007 voucher contracts. Within the funds for Section 202, approximately $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators. Another $35 million was made available through the Section 8 tenant-based account, for a total of $67 million for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than FY2010. $39 million was provided for the Assisted Living Conversion program. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest assistance program administered by HUD. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, which is the largest assistance program administered by HUD. The account funds annual renewal for 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies and covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. The tenant-based rental assistance account funds annual renewal for 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies and covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. The tenant-based rental assistance account is funded using current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. Funding for voucher renewals and allocation to Public Housing Authorities have been debated since FY2004. The primary issues revolve around whether the proposed funding is sufficient to cover all leased vouchers used by families. In the HUD appropriations process, debates focus on funding allocation to over 2,000 PHAs for the voucher program. Questions arise on whether proposed funding is enough for all leased vouchers and if it will be used efficiently to serve families while controlling costs. Congress allocated $16 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010 based on PHAs' prior year costs and utilization. In FY2010, Congress allocated $16 billion for voucher renewals to over 2,000 PHAs based on their prior year costs and utilization. HUD adjusted costs for inflation to determine funding eligibility. The amount provided was sufficient for over 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility, but some vouchers were not utilized in FY2009. In FY2010, Congress allocated $16 billion for voucher renewals to over 2,000 PHAs based on prior year costs and utilization. HUD adjusted costs for inflation to determine funding eligibility. However, some PHAs did not utilize all their vouchers in FY2009, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 for all vouchers. Budget Justifications show that PHAs had 94% of their vouchers under lease in FY2009. CY2010 funding was based on FY2009 utilization, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 for all vouchers. Only PHAs with decreased costs or extra reserve funding could increase utilization. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, enough to fund about 95% of all vouchers in use. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to fund about 95% of all vouchers in use. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications indicated that the funding would be sufficient, with allocations based on prior year costs and utilization, plus inflation. PHAs with unspent reserve funding could see reduced allocations, while those with lower reserves could receive reallocated funding. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, with funding allocated based on prior year costs and utilization, plus inflation. PHAs with unspent reserve funding could see reduced allocations, while those with lower reserves could receive reallocated funding to increase utilization and serve more families. The budget also requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional increases in leasing. The President's FY2011 budget requested funding based on prior year costs and utilization, with a focus on reallocating funds to PHAs with lower reserves to increase utilization. The budget also called for lifting the ban on \"over-leasing\" to allow for additional increases in leasing. In FY2011, the President's budget requested funding to maintain existing vouchers but not enough for all authorized vouchers. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals due to lower inflation estimates. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than requested in the President's budget, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report stated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be sufficient to meet the program's renewal needs and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The formula for allocating renewal funding largely followed the President's request. The committee report on H.R. 5850 indicated that the allocated amount would meet the program's renewal needs and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The formula for funding largely followed the President's request, but did not include the reallocation authority requested. The committee believed major authorization changes were needed outside of the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. The committee report on H.R. 5850 supported funding for all vouchers in use but did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The committee believed major authorization changes were necessary outside of the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. S. 3644 would have changed the funding formula for PHA funding to reflect the program's needs based on prior calendar year spending. The bill, S. 3644, proposed changes to the funding formula for PHA funding to align with prior calendar year spending, rather than fiscal year spending. It aimed to better meet the program's needs and fund renewals below the President's request. The bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The Senate bill, S. 3644, aimed to fund PHA renewals below the President's request by adjusting the funding formula to use calendar year spending. It did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, citing concerns about potential cost increases. The committee report also directed HUD to report on plans for better monitoring of PHAs' financial management. The committee report accompanying the bill expresses concerns about potential cost increases and financial management in the program. Both H.R. 1 and the final FY2011 appropriations law did not make changes to the funding allocation formula from FY2010. The funding for renewals was less than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) changed the funding allocation formula from FY2010. Both provided less funding for renewals than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, with HUD requesting $114 million for this purpose in FY2011. Both the House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's request. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account with $114 million in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) appropriated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing the funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) appropriated less than requested by the President for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each PHA has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million allocated across PHAs. In recent years, Congress has provided funding to renew vouchers issued since 2007, totaling around 2.3 million authorized vouchers allocated across Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Additional vouchers may be created by Congress, including replacement vouchers for families displaced from other HUD programs and new \"incremental\" vouchers for special populations or purposes. In recent years, Congress has provided funding for new vouchers, including replacement vouchers for displaced families and incremental vouchers for special populations or purposes. This funding includes $15 million for child welfare system vouchers and $75 million for homeless veterans in FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing programs. In FY2010, Congress allocated $15 million for child welfare system vouchers and $75 million for homeless veterans. The President's FY2011 budget requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing programs. The House bill from the 111th Congress included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration request, $75 million for homeless veterans through the VASH program, and $66 million for families displaced by the 2005 hurricanes. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress had similar provisions. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration request, $75 million for VASH vouchers for homeless veterans, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP) providing vouchers to families in the child welfare system. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress funded the President's homelessness demonstration, provided $75 million for VASH vouchers, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP). The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated about $50 million for VASH vouchers and funded project-based rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers and funding for project-based rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. HUD provides subsidies to make up the rent difference for eligible low-income families living in subsidized units. No new contracts have been entered into under this program since the early 1980s. HUD provides subsidies to private multifamily property owners to make up the rent difference for eligible low-income families in subsidized units. Contracts for this program have not been entered into since the early 1980s, and once they expire, new annual appropriations are needed for renewal. In the 1980s, Congress funded contracts for 20- to 40-year periods for a program that provides subsidies to private multifamily property owners. Once these contracts expire, new annual appropriations are required for renewal. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. HUD states that more funding is needed to maintain subsidies as contracts expire and new appropriations are required for amendment funding. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. HUD contends that the funding level requested should be sufficient to provide a full year's funding for all contracts that require funding and to renew any expiring contracts, with an estimated $662 million needed for amendment needs. HUD requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance in FY2011, with $662 million needed for amendment needs. Funding has been a mix of current year appropriations and advance appropriations since FY2009, with the President requesting this model to continue in FY2011. Both the House and Senate are involved in the funding process. In FY2011, HUD requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, with $662 million needed for amendments. The funding model of using both current year and advance appropriations was requested to continue by the President. The House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's funding level, with final appropriations providing less than the requested amount. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided just under $120 million less than the President's request. The budget requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants by transferring housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. The President's budget proposes transferring HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility, similar to the Section 8 project-based voucher program. Three categories of properties are targeted for this transfer. The President's budget proposes transferring HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Three categories of properties are targeted for this transfer, with a goal of transferring 300,000 units. The President's budget proposes transferring 300,000 HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Properties in three categories are targeted for this transfer: public housing properties, public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs, and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. Properties in the first and third categories would be selected by HUD for participation, while properties in the second category would compete by submitting plans to HUD. The funding allocated for this transfer is $290 million. The President's budget proposes transferring 300,000 HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Properties in three categories are targeted for this transfer: public housing properties, public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs, and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. Most of the funding, $290 million out of $300 million requested, would be used to cover the difference between current subsidy levels and the new, presumably higher, subsidy level under the new program. Another $50 million would be used to offset the cost of combining PHA activities. The President's budget proposes transferring 300,000 HUD-assisted housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program. $290 million of the $300 million requested would cover the difference between current and new subsidy levels. $50 million would be used for combining PHA activities and promoting tenant mobility, while $10 million is allocated for technical assistance and program evaluation. HUD plans to submit legislation to Congress for implementation. The President's budget proposes transferring 300,000 HUD-assisted housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program. $290 million of the $300 million requested would cover the difference between current and new subsidy levels. $50 million would be used for combining PHA activities and promoting tenant mobility, while $10 million is allocated for technical assistance and program evaluation. HUD plans to submit legislation to Congress for implementation. The draft legislation, known as the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act, is available on HUD's website. The draft legislation, named the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act, is available on HUD's website. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 did not include funding for the President's initiative. Committees expressed concerns about the proposal's development and unknown future costs. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program offers rental units for very low-income families and is HUD's oldest program. The proposal for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative lacked development and future cost estimates. Funding for the initiative was not included in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for very low-income families and is HUD's oldest housing assistance program. Congress continues to support over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities owning and maintaining 1.2 million units. The Public Housing program, established in 1937, is HUD's oldest housing assistance program. Congress supports over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities owning and maintaining 1.2 million units. HUD provides funding through the operating fund to fill the gap between tenants' rent contributions and maintenance costs. The capital fund provides funding for large projects and modernization. HOPE VI is a grant program for demolishing and/or renovating public housing. Through the operating fund, HUD provides funding to PHAs to bridge the gap between tenants' rent contributions and maintenance costs. The capital fund supports large projects and modernization. HOPE VI is a grant program for redeveloping distressed public housing. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications support this funding allocation. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the public housing capital fund, with HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications supporting this allocation. The decrease in capital funding takes into account the previous capital funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The requested amount for the operating fund would be enough to fund PHAs' full eligibility. The decrease in capital fund considers previous funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. PHAs can transfer up to 20% of their capital funding for operating expenses, allowing more capital funds to be spent on capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request. The Administration seeks full funding of the operating fund to allow more capital funds for PHAs' capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request, with a $500 million increase for the capital fund in addition to a $50 million set-aside for early childhood education and care facilities. The Senate bill included a $50 million set-aside from the capital fund for grants for PHAs to provide early childhood education and care facilities. H.R. 1 proposed significant cuts to the public housing capital and operating funds compared to FY2010. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) funded the public housing capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be offset by PHAs' use of program reserves. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) provided higher funding for the public housing capital fund compared to H.R. 1, but less than FY2010. The operating fund received about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund could be offset by PHAs' use of program reserves. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves. The President's budget did not request new funding for HOPE VI, instead, it requested $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new Obama Administration proposal modeled after the HOPE VI program. The President's budget for FY2011 requested no new funding for HOPE VI but $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a program modeled after HOPE VI to revitalize distressed neighborhoods beyond public housing. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative is based on the HOPE VI program, providing grants to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, not just public housing. Eligible entities include PHAs, local governments, nonprofits, and for-profit developers. The funding aims to transform, rehabilitate, and replace HUD public and assisted housing. Congress allocated $200 million to HOPE VI in FY2010, with up to $65 million reserved for Choice. Nonprofits, for-profit developers eligible for funding to transform, rehabilitate, replace HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to HOPE VI, with $65 million for Choice Neighborhoods. House and Senate in FY2011 had differing positions on funding. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 suggested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. In FY2011, the House and Senate had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 suggested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD circulated draft legislation for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, and the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the topic in March 2010. In FY2011, the House Financial Services Committee ordered reported the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) which included authorization of the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative with $250 million funding. The final FY2011 funding law provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI. The Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) included authorization for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, but was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI and did not modify the $65 million set-aside from FY2010. This means that most of the HOPE VI funding may be used for Choice Neighborhoods in FY2011. Congress also authorized the creation of a national Housing Trust Fund in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) to provide a permanent source of funding for affordable housing. The majority of HOPE VI funding in FY2011 may be used for Choice Neighborhoods as the $65 million set-aside from FY2010 remains unchanged. The Housing Trust Fund, established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), aims to provide a dedicated funding source for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families with contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Housing Trust Fund, established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, aimed to provide dedicated funding for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were identified as the funding source, but their contributions were suspended in November 2008 due to financial difficulties. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, aimed to provide funding for affordable rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended in 2008, leaving the fund without a funding source. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008 to provide funding for affordable rental housing for extremely low-income families, has been left without a funding source since contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended in 2008. Despite requests in the President's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets for $1 billion in mandatory funding, Congress has not yet allocated any funding to the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008 to provide funding for affordable rental housing for extremely low-income families, has not received any funding from Congress despite requests in the President's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aimed to provide funding for the Housing Trust Fund, but no funding has been allocated to date. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, has not received funding from Congress despite legislative proposals in the 111th Congress. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities. Funding for the Housing Trust Fund was not included in H.R. 5850, S. 3644, or the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10). The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities through funding for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Funding for the initiative involves appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer up to 1% from most accounts in HUD. The funding request for the Transformation Initiative includes appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer up to 1% from most accounts in HUD's budget. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority, potentially totaling $435 million if fully funded. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority, potentially totaling $435 million if fully funded. However, the fund received only $239 million due to restrictions. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, which could have resulted in almost $470 million for the transformation fund. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, potentially providing almost $470 million for the transformation fund. However, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included a more limited version of the transfer authority, resulting in total funding available from transfers being well under half of the President's request. In FY2011, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a limited version of the President's requested transfer authority. The House and Senate bills proposed limits on funding transfers, giving directions on fund allocation. The House report emphasized a broader vision for Transforming HUD and the Transformation Initiative beyond budgetary flexibility. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress proposed limits on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's discretion in allocating funds for eligible activities. The Transformation Initiative funds were restricted to the core needs of the Department, with a focus on oversight of funding. The Committee limited the use of Transformation Initiative funds to core Department needs, emphasizing oversight. Minimum funding levels were recommended for IT modernization and technical assistance. The authority for transfers under the Initiative was not included in H.R. 1. The Committee limited the use of Transformation Initiative funds to core Department needs, emphasizing oversight. Minimum funding levels were recommended for IT modernization and technical assistance. H.R. 1 did not include the authority for transfers under the Initiative. The bill allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updated computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program, instead of the $20 million requested for combating mortgage fraud. P.L. 112-10 also included $71 million for new FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems. The bill included $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updated computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program, instead of the $20 million requested for combating mortgage fraud. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) permitted HUD the requested transfer authority under the transformation initiative, but from a more limited number of accounts than requested by the President. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives for the Community Development Block Grant. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. It would have continued to fund CDBG at its FY2010 level and eliminated funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, Neighborhood Initiative, and Economic Development Initiative. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed changes to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. It aimed to maintain funding for CDBG at its FY2010 level while cutting funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, Neighborhood Initiative, and Economic Development Initiative. Additionally, new initiatives such as Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse were introduced, along with the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed changes to Community Development Fund activities, including a reduction in funding from $4.450 billion to $4.380 billion. New initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse were introduced, along with revamping programs such as the University Community Fund and the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a reduction in funding for Community Development Fund activities from $4.450 billion to $4.380 billion. This reduction would defund Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants, reallocating the savings to fund the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a reduction in CDF activities by defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants. Savings would fund Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and a new Catalytic Investments Competition Grants initiative for distressed communities. No new funding was requested for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a reduction in CDF activities by defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants. A new initiative, Catalytic Investments Competition Grants, was introduced to support economic development projects in distressed communities. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including $89.3 million contrary to the Administration's budget request. The House bill, H.R. 5850, recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 3644, recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with funding for EDI and NI congressional earmarked projects totaling $193 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 3644, recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with $193 million allocated for EDI and NI projects. Both the House and Senate bills also recommended continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund at their FY2010 levels. The Senate bill recommended $193 million for EDI and NI projects, with continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund at FY2010 levels. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.501 billion for CDF activities, 21.2% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than requested by the Administration for FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, reducing funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for the Sustainable Communities Initiative by 33%. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative was not funded. The FY2011 appropriations law reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for the Sustainable Communities Initiative by 33%. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative program was not funded. The CDF account supports activities through the CDBG program and other community development-related programs. The CDF account supports activities through the CDBG program, EDI, and NI programs, which are federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. The CDBG program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a major source of federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Funds are awarded to various communities and states to support activities that benefit low- and moderate-income individuals or aid in eliminating slums or blight. The CDBG program provides financial assistance to communities and states to support activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, eliminating slums or blight, and addressing public health and safety threats. Funding for FY2011 was proposed to remain at over $3.9 billion, with additional funding for Sustainable Communities initiatives. For FY2011, the Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG formula-based component of the program at over $3.9 billion. Additional funding was allocated for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and Indian tribes, insular areas, University Partnerships, and the Transformation Initiative. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed slightly higher funding for the CDBG formula grant program compared to the President's request and FY2010 funding levels. The Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG formula-based program at over $3.9 billion for FY2011. Additional funding was allocated for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and Indian tribes, insular areas, University Partnerships, and the Transformation Initiative. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed slightly higher funding for the CDBG formula grant program compared to the President's request and FY2010 funding levels. The House passed H.R. 1, which would have reduced the CDF account by 66.3%. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion and prohibiting funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion and prohibiting funds for earmarks and the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative. It did not specify how funds should be allocated among the components of the CDBG program. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion.

The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) provides financial incentives to mortgage servicers to lower monthly payments for troubled borrowers. Housing counseling is required for homeowners with high debt-to-income ratios, and funding from the NFMCP can be used for counseling. Borrowers eligible for HAMP are encouraged to seek assistance from housing counselors funded by NFMCP and HUD. Recipients of NFMCP funding can use up to 30% of their grants for counseling borrowers eligible for HAMP. Housing counseling agencies funded by NFMCP and HUD provide assistance to these borrowers.
