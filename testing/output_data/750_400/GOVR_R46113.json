Federal agencies then obligate funds for their activities before making payments. Congressional clients can refer to CRS experts for guidance on DHS appropriations. Budget authority enacted by Congress determines the funds available for federal agencies to spend. Obligations are made from this authority, with payments reflected as outlays. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than allocated. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, determining the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than allocated by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite in amount and available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, determining the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. It may be indefinite in amount and available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is available for obligation only during a specific fiscal year, while multiyear and no-year budget authority allow for spending over a range of time or indefinitely. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, determining the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. One-year budget authority is available for obligation only during a specific fiscal year, while multiyear budget authority specifies a range of time for spending, and no-year budget authority is available for an indefinite period. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions creating a legal requirement for payment, while outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments, or outlays, to be made from the Treasury. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year due to multiyear obligations and future spending. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments from the Treasury. It may not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year due to multiyear obligations and future spending. Discretionary and Mandatory Spending Gross budget authority is composed of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending not mandated by existing law. Gross budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is not mandated by existing law. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts and is typically not appropriated each year. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated yearly and are included in appropriations acts. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, includes budget authority provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs require annual appropriations and are included in appropriations acts. For example, within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds collected by the federal government are not considered federal revenue but are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority consists of total appropriated funds. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government from government accounts or the public as part of a business-type transaction. These funds are not considered federal revenue but are counted as negative outlays. They offset discretionary spending and can also offset mandatory spending, which typically includes entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by offsetting collections that reduce discretionary spending. The DHS budget features mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. The DHS budget includes entitlement programs like Secret Service and Coast Guard retirement pay, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, there are Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the budget calculations. The DHS budget includes Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget calculations for gross budget authority. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving 302(a) allocations. The congressional budget process involves two stages. In the first stage, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. These totals are then allocated among congressional committees through 302(a) allocations. In the second stage, appropriations committees allocate the discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. In the second stage, the appropriations committees allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each bill, known as the 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to the 302(b) allocations may occur during the year. The 302(b) allocations are amounts allocated to subcommittees for appropriations bills, based on the 302(a) discretionary allocation. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to the 302(b) allocations may occur during the year. The 302(b) allocations may be adjusted during the year by the appropriations committee issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as appropriations bills progress. Table A-1 shows figures for the 302(b) allocation for FY2020, based on the adjusted net discretionary budget authority. Amendments in the House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill put the bill over its 302(b) discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion. The House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded its 302(b) discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, but this was later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 through FY2021. The House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded its 302(b) discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, which was later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 through FY2021, with adjustments made by subsequent legislation. The majority of the DHS budget is considered nondefense spending, and adjustments are allowed for funding overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense from FY2012 through FY2021, with subsequent legislation amending the caps. Most of DHS's budget is nondefense spending, with allowances for adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and healthcare fraud control. Three justifications in the Budget Control Act have influenced DHS's appropriations process. The Budget Control Act set spending limits for defense and nondefense from FY2012 to FY2021, with adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and healthcare fraud control. Three justifications in the Act have impacted DHS's appropriations process, including emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and limited disaster relief adjustments determined by OMB. The Budget Control Act set spending limits for defense and nondefense from FY2012 to FY2021, with adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and healthcare fraud control. DHS's appropriations process is impacted by three justifications in the Act: emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and limited disaster relief adjustments determined by OMB. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by OMB using a specific formula until FY2019, which was later amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief adjustments, increasing the allowable adjustment size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This adjustment capacity can now be carried over indefinitely, rather than just for one year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief adjustments, increasing the allowable adjustment size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The act also extended the availability of unused adjustment capacity indefinitely. In August 2019, OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating the allowable adjustment for disaster relief at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. The OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating an allowable adjustment for disaster relief at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. This estimate includes the 10-year average, 5% of emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final allowable adjustment for FY2020 may still vary from this estimate."
