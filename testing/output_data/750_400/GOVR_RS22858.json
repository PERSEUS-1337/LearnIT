    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with other energy technologies over different time periods, including the past 10 years, the 41-year period since DOE was established, and a 71-year funding history. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was determined by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies were determined by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), signed by the President on May 5, 2017. Final funding for FY2018 was set by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), signed on May 23. The Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) signed on May 5, 2017, contained funding for Energy and Water Development programs. Final funding for FY2018 was set by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) signed on May 23, 2018. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. Figure 1 and Table 1 show funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) signed on May 23, 2018, includes funding levels for the Department of Energy (DOE) within Energy and Water Development programs. Tables and figures display funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978, along with cumulative funding totals for the past 10, 41, and 71 years. Data is also presented as relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. The data from Table 1 is converted into relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source over the past 10, 41, and 71 years. Figures 2, 3, and 4 display pie charts showing the cumulative DOE spending for each period. Energy availability, especially liquid fuels, played a critical role in World War II. Figure 3 shows the relative shares of cumulative DOE spending for each technology or energy source over the 10 years from FY2009 through FY2018. Figure 4 provides a similar chart for the period from FY1978 through FY2018, with a focus on the post-World War II era when R&D was applied to energy development to support economic growth. During the post-World War II era, the federal government applied research and development (R&D) to energy sources for economic growth, focusing on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management, including research on \"atoms for peace.\" The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee R&D on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion. The AEC focused on nuclear energy for civilian power production and was later incorporated into the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975. The Federal Energy Administration was established in 1974 in response to the oil embargo by Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. In 1975, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was created, incorporating the AEC and other energy programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, consolidating all energy R&D programs under its administration. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, incorporating activities of the FEA and ERDA. It brought together all energy R&D programs including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Total spending on fossil energy technologies from FY1948 to FY1977 was about $17.1 billion. The DOE undertook a small program in energy storage and electricity system R&D that supports the main energy technology programs. Federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies from FY1948 to FY1977, with spending totaling $17.1 billion for fossil energy and $51.6 billion for nuclear energy R&D in constant FY2016 dollars. The energy crises of the 1970s prompted an expansion of federal R&D efforts. The federal government spent $51.6 billion on nuclear energy R&D in constant FY2016 dollars, with additional funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies starting in the 1970s. DOE has been the primary source of energy R&D funding since FY1978. The federal government expanded R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in the 1970s. DOE has been the main source of energy R&D funding since FY1978, with funding for energy technologies peaking in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 constant dollars) and dropping to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has gradually increased since then. Funding for energy technologies peaked in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 constant dollars) and dropped to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Since then, funding has gradually increased, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding stood at nearly $4.5 billion."
