In FY2008, the Administration requested emergency supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Congress approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. Additional requests were made for MRAP vehicles and emergency defense and international funding. Congress began considering FY2008 supplemental appropriations in fall 2007. In October 2007, Congress approved emergency defense and international affairs funding. The Army and Marine Corps faced challenges due to delays in funding for overseas military operations. The regular FY2008 defense appropriations act was passed in November, with funds used for both day-to-day activities and war-related operations. The high pace of operations in Iraq quickly depleted the base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance. The regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, passed in November, provided funding for day-to-day peacetime activities and war-related operations for the Army and Marine Corps. Due to the high pace of operations in Iraq, the base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance was quickly depleted. Administration officials warned that without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. The Army and Marine Corps were quickly running out of money without supplemental funding. The Defense Department considered various options to extend operations, including transferring funds or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue. The Defense Department considered options to extend operations, such as transferring funds or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue by providing funding for military operations. The $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue by providing funding for military operations, including most of what the Defense Department had requested for Army and Marine Corp operation and maintenance and military personnel accounts in the consolidated FY2008 appropriations act. Defense officials estimate this funding will last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance. The Defense Department can extend operations beyond mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or using other authorities. Up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority is available for this purpose. The Defense Department has options to extend operations by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or using other authorities. Up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority is available. The Administration submitted requests for FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations in three blocks totaling $141.7 billion for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies.

The request included a rough estimate of continuing operations costs at the same pace as in 2006. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at the same pace as in 2006. The Administration later requested an additional $5.3 billion for the Department of Defense to procure Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles.

The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, allocated $14.5 billion for domestic programs. Congress also included a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. Congressional action on FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September and was completed shortly before Christmas. Congress quickly provided funds for MRAP vehicles and debated measures for partial year funding for overseas operations. Congress quickly provided $5.2 billion in emergency funding for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in September 2007. The House and Senate approved a conference agreement on the FY2008 emergency supplemental funding on November 8, 2007. In September 2007, Congress allocated $5.2 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in the FY2008 defense appropriations bill, signed into law in November.

The Senate later rejected a motion to consider the bill. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4156, effectively killing the measure. They also rejected a substitute offered by Senator McConnell to provide $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. The Senate rejected a motion to proceed with H.R. 4156, effectively ending the measure. They also voted against a substitute by Senator McConnell for $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Defense Secretary Gates warned of limited operations without additional funding. On November 20, 2007, the Defense Department announced that without additional funding, the Army and Marine Corps would have to limit operations, potentially leading to furloughs of government employees and contractors. Defense Secretary Gates warned of these consequences if Congress did not approve more funding soon. The Defense Department announced on November 20, 2007, that the Army and Marine Corps would have to limit operations without additional funding. This could lead to furloughs of government employees and contractors. The Army would only be able to operate with available funds until February 23, 2008, unless additional funding is approved soon. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to the Army and Joint IED Defeat Organization to extend operations until February 23. Congress needed to approve additional funding to prevent halting essential operations for the Army and Marine Corps. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill for FY2008. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, for FY2008, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for various programs.

On December 18, 2007, the Senate adopted an amendment to provide $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without limits on where the money could be used and without requiring a withdrawal of forces from Iraq. The House then approved the Senate amendment on December 19, 2007. On December 19, 2007, the House approved a motion to agree to the Senate amendment for $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations. The President signed the consolidated appropriations bill into law on December 26, 2007, resolving a dispute over war funding. The House approved $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, clearing the measure for the President to sign into law as P.L. 110-161 on December 26, 2007. This resolved a dispute over war funding that had threatened Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. The Defense Department announced plans to shut down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008 due to a lack of supplemental appropriations. Secretary of Defense Gates warned of furloughs for 100,000 civilian and contractor personnel. However, $70 billion in emergency funding averted the shutdown until at least June 2008. Gates stated that the Defense Department would need to halt operations at all Army bases by mid-February next year, leading to furloughs of 100,000 civilian and 100,000 contractor personnel. The $70 billion emergency funding in the consolidated appropriations act prevented a shutdown until at least June 2008, providing $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations. This additional funding, combined with regular appropriations, will sustain Army operations until the end of June 2008. The supplemental funding of $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations, combined with regular appropriations, will sustain Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August. The Army and Marine Corps operations are funded until June and August 2008 respectively. The Army will exhaust its military personnel funds by mid-June, but the Defense Department may extend operations by transferring funds or slowing down the pace of operations. At least $11.4 billion is available for transfers. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for transfers between accounts to extend Army and Marine Corps operations beyond June and August 2008. This includes $3.7 billion in general transfer authority and $4.0 billion for fund transfers provided in the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for transfers between accounts to extend Army and Marine Corps operations beyond June and August 2008. This includes $3.7 billion in general transfer authority provided in the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, $3.7 billion appropriated to the Iraqi Freedom Fund, and $4.0 billion of authority to transfer funds provided as defense emergency appropriations provisions in the consolidated appropriations act. Additional amounts may be available in cash balances of DOD working capital funds. Transfers could extend Army operations for another month without slowing down operations, reducing DOD's financial flexibility. The Defense Department has $4.0 billion in authority to transfer funds for extending Army operations beyond June and August 2008. This could potentially extend operations for another month without slowing down, but would reduce financial flexibility. Congress's agreement to provide a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate, but underlying issues remain unsettled. The Defense Department could extend operations by invoking the Feed and Forage Act or using other authority to allocate financing. Congress's $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate, but underlying issues remain unsettled regarding the Defense Department's flexibility in delaying or avoiding shutdowns without full-year appropriations. In FY2008, the Defense Department faced a recurring issue of how to finance day-to-day activities and war-related operations without full-year appropriations from Congress. The Department projected funds would be exhausted by February for the Army and early April for the Marine Corps. DOD proposed transferring $4.1 billion to the Army to address this issue. In FY2008, the Defense Department faced funding challenges for day-to-day and war-related operations. CRS calculated funds would run out by February for the Army and early April for the Marine Corps. DOD proposed a $4.1 billion transfer to the Army to extend operations. Without supplemental appropriations, DOD could sustain operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts and slowing down spending. The transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army would extend its operations for two to three weeks. The Defense Department could sustain operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts and slowing down spending. Alternative measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or using Navy and Air Force funds for Army support operations abroad could also extend operations, but with limitations and disadvantages. The Defense Department has been able to sustain operations longer by using novel measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or assigning Navy and Air Force funds for Army support operations abroad. However, these alternatives have limits and disadvantages, such as reducing financial flexibility and disrupting day-to-day operations. The use of these funding sources has raised concerns about weakening congressional war powers. The use of alternative funding sources for military operations, such as the Feed and Forage Act and reallocating Navy and Air Force funds for Army support, may reduce DOD's financial flexibility and disrupt day-to-day operations. This has raised concerns about weakening congressional war powers. The potential disruptive effects of these measures must be weighed against the possibility of furloughing personnel sooner than necessary.
