    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to amend the Clean Air Act by placing emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. The caps would be imposed in two phases: 2010 and 2018. A modified version of Clear Skies was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131. The Clear Skies proposal introduced emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg through a tradeable allowance program in two phases: 2010 and 2018. A modified version of Clear Skies (S. 131) was introduced in the 109th Congress. The focus of debate has been on the cap-and-trade implementation scheme. EPA states that Clear Skies would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. The Clear Skies proposal (S. 131) introduced by Senator Inhofe has sparked congressional hearings and potential markup. Debate has centered on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme, with EPA claiming it would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury at lower costs. The proposal's cap-and-trade provisions are seen as less significant in terms of its interaction with the Clean Air Act structure. EPA has already implemented regional cap-and-trade regulations. The Clear Skies proposal aims to reduce SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions at lower costs through cap-and-trade provisions. EPA has already implemented regional cap-and-trade regulations for NOx emissions. The EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations to control NOx emissions over the eastern United States and achieve reductions in SO2 and NOx levels. Additionally, they have proposed regulations for mercury reductions under the Clear Skies initiative, although their legality is in question. These regulations aim to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act related to affected electric generating facilities. The EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations for NOx emissions and mercury reductions under the Clear Skies initiative. The legality of these regulations is in question. The Administration believes certain Clean Air Act provisions are no longer necessary. EPA Administrator Whitman stated that certain provisions are being altered or held in abeyance for affected electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. The Administration believes certain Clean Air Act provisions, such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain, could be eliminated and combined under the Clear Skies initiative for affected electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. EPA Administrator Whitman stated that these regulatory aspects may no longer be necessary. The Clear Skies legislation aims to simplify regulations by combining various Clean Air Act provisions for affected electric generating units and industrial sources. New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain could be eliminated under this new legislation, depending on the final targets set. The Clear Skies legislation aims to simplify regulations by combining various Clean Air Act provisions for affected electric generating units and industrial sources. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the structure of the Clean Air Act, particularly with respect to Title I, is examined in this report. This report analyzes the potential effects of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act's structure for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Changes would primarily impact Title I regulations, considering factors like location, facility age, and fuel type. The regulatory focus remains on SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. The Clean Air Act's regulatory structure for electric generating units and industrial sources is primarily focused on SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. The addition of Title IV in 1990, including a cap-and-trade program for SO2 emissions, did not alter the Act's fundamental framework established in 1970 and expanded in 1977. Various distinctions, such as location, facility age, and fuel type, impact utility planning and operations within the regulatory structure. The Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970 and expanded in 1977, applies to SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. The addition of Title IV in 1990, with a cap-and-trade program for SO2 emissions, did not change the Act's basic requirements. The Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards, New Source Performance Standards, and Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to protect air quality. Title IV in 1990 was a supplemental provision, not a substitute for existing requirements. NAAQS set limits on specified air pollutants, while NSPS set emission limits for new polluting facilities. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate air quality by setting limits on specified pollutants and emission limits for new facilities. NAAQS are periodically reviewed by the EPA to protect public health with enforceable deadlines for compliance. States are primarily responsible for ensuring compliance. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established NAAQS for six pollutants, including SO2, NOx, and PM. EPA sets primary NAAQS to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety and reviews them periodically. States are responsible for implementing NAAQS through SIPs to reduce emissions and ensure compliance. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to implement State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reduce emissions from existing facilities and ensure ambient pollution levels stay below NAAQS. For areas not meeting NAAQS, new sources must use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions increase. LAER is based on the strictest emission rate without considering cost. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to require new sources to install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions increase. LAER is based on the most stringent emission rate without considering cost or energy use. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) determined by states based on federal guidelines. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are emission limitations for major new facilities. The 1970 Clean Air Act established emission standards for new and existing sources of air pollution. New sources must install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology, while existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) set emission limitations for major new facilities, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. EPA reviews these standards every eight years. The Clean Air Act imposes emission standards on new and existing sources of air pollution, including NSPS for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM10 are set by the EPA and reviewed every eight years. The Act addresses interstate pollution through mechanisms like regional commissions and state petitions under Section 126. The Clean Air Act has established mechanisms to address interstate pollution, including regional commissions and state petitions. The NOx SIP Call regulates NOx emissions in 20 states and the District of Columbia, allowing states to achieve emission budgets in their preferred way. EPA recognizes the regional nature of the ozone issue in the eastern United States. Under the NOx SIP Call, 20 states and the District of Columbia control NOx emissions through emission budgets. EPA encouraged states to implement the rule through a coordinated cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are largely free from controls. The EPA successfully encouraged states to implement a cap-and-trade program to control emissions in the eastern United States. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are largely free from controls. Major new sources, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, are subject to NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 CAA added the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) to the air quality control regimen. The 1977 Clean Air Act broadened air quality control with the addition of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution concentrations depending on classification. The PSD program under the Clean Air Act focuses on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air areas, allowing for some increase in pollution depending on classification. Class I areas like national parks have very little degradation allowed, while Class II areas permit moderate degradation. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, allowing degradation up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review (NSR) and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) as the minimum level of control. State permitting agencies determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT cannot be less stringent than federal NSPS. The PSD program requires new sources in designated areas to undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). State agencies determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS, but can be more so if needed to avoid violating emission limitations or NAAQS. The regional haze program complements the PSD program for existing sources. The regional haze program (Section 169A of the Act) focuses on preventing and remedying impairment of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas caused by manmade air pollution. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 must install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to reduce pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. EPA promulgated regional haze regulations in 1999. The regional haze program aims to address visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas caused by manmade air pollution. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 are required to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to reduce pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. The EPA implemented a regional haze program in 1999, which includes stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. Additionally, Title I imposes air quality control requirements on fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The EPA implemented a regional haze program in 1999 to address visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas caused by air pollution. This program includes stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. Additionally, Title I imposes air quality control requirements on fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The program also establishes a two-phase federal regulatory program for 188 hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, with the first phase focusing on Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources of pollutants. The federal regulatory program for 188 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) includes mercury. MACT standards are to be set for major sources of pollutants, with additional regulations possible after eight years to address any \"residual risks\" from HAPs. Electric utilities have special treatment under Section 112. The MACT standards are set for major sources of pollutants, with additional regulations possible after eight years to address any \"residual risks\" from HAPs. Electric utilities have special treatment under Section 112, requiring EPA to report to Congress on the hazards to public health before issuing MACT standards. EPA made a finding in December 2000, but in January 2004, it proposed further regulations. In Section 112(n), the EPA reported to Congress on public health hazards from electric generating units' emissions of HAPs and found regulation under Section 112 to be necessary. However, in January 2004, the EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 instead of MACT standards for electric utilities. In January 2004, the EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 as its preferred approach instead of MACT standards for electric utilities. States can implement more stringent standards for HAPs than federal ones, with some states already doing so. Changes under the Clear Skies proposal would impact current regulations for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury. States like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Wisconsin already have more stringent standards for HAPs than federal regulations. Table 2 summarizes the current requirements imposed on fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities by Section 112. Clear Skies proposal would bring significant changes, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and modifications to existing regulations for SO2 emissions. The Clear Skies proposal includes significant changes such as establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2. Other modifications remove certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants and hold certain provisions in abeyance for several years. Additional authorities include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, national emission standards for electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to participate in the cap-and-trade program. The Clear Skies proposal includes significant changes such as establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and removing certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Additional authorities include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, national emission standards for electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to participate in the cap-and-trade program. The Clear Skies proposal includes significant changes such as establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and removing certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Changes include provisions for major sources, hazardous air pollutants control, and a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution. The Clear Skies proposal includes changes such as national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, revisions to the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and elimination of certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. This includes changes to major sources, hazardous air pollutants control, a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, reduction of noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of more stringent state requirements for NOx and mercury, and elimination of New Source Review for modifications of major sources. The Clear Skies proposal includes changes such as national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, revisions to the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and elimination of certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. This includes a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, reduction of noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of more stringent state requirements for NOx and mercury, and elimination of New Source Review for modifications of major sources. Additional changes involve establishing a statutory 50 km zone around Class I areas for imposition of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements and exempting certain regulations related to visibility protection. The proposed changes include elimination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements, establishment of a 50 km zone for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements, extension of deadlines for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS, and moratoriums on ozone nonattainment provisions and conformity requirements. The Clear Skies proposal includes provisions for a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It also includes exemptions for units in PSD Class II areas, extended deadlines for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS, and moratoriums on ozone nonattainment provisions and conformity requirements. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It sets caps on emissions in two phases and establishes trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 of the program would establish caps for EGUs of 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. The proposal for a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program, known as S. 131, includes caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases. Phase 1 sets caps for EGUs at 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated free to EGUs based on historic fuel usage. The S. 131 Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are set at 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated free to EGUs based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. The new NOx and Hg programs under Clear Skies would adjust allowance allocations based on factors specified in the bill, with a small pool reserved for new units. National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from new and reconstructed EGUs would be more stringent than current standards. Clear Skies would establish stricter emission standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs compared to current NSPS, with the Hg standard being particularly stringent. The proposed National Emission Standards would set lower limits for emissions from coal-fired EGUs compared to the current NSPS, with stricter standards for particulate matter and mercury. The Hg standard would be more stringent for certain types of units but allow higher emissions for others. The standards would apply to fewer units and be reviewed every eight years for potential revisions. The National Emission Standards propose stricter limits for emissions from coal-fired EGUs compared to the current NSPS. It would apply to fewer units and be reviewed every eight years for potential revisions. Additionally, S. 131 would allow non-affected EGUs to opt into the cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The proposal allows non-affected EGUs to opt into the cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions, with alternative methods for determining allowances based on unit's emissions and output. Units would receive allocations based on baseline emissions, with reductions starting in 2010. The proposal establishes alternative methods for determining allowances for units based on their emissions and output. Units would receive allocations equal to a percentage of their baseline emissions for SO2, NOx, and mercury, with reductions starting in 2010 and 2018. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program starting in 2010 would receive allocations based on federal or state hazardous air pollutant standards. They would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories and could become permanently exempt if accepted by the EPA. Additionally, opting units would no longer be considered major sources or emitting facilities. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories and could become permanently exempt if accepted by the EPA. Additionally, opting units would no longer be considered major sources or emitting facilities. The ClearSkies proposal would exempt opt-in units from certain requirements for 20 years if pollution control equipment is properly maintained. It also introduces a new \"transitional\" designation for areas instead of \"nonattainment\" for ozone regulations. The ClearSkies proposal aims to limit emissions through pollution control equipment and good combustion practices. It introduces a new \"transitional\" designation for areas instead of \"nonattainment\" for ozone and PM 2.5 standards. EPA modeling shows that many areas could qualify for this transitional status. The ClearSkies proposal introduces a new \"transitional\" designation for areas instead of \"nonattainment\" for ozone and PM 2.5 standards. EPA modeling shows that many areas could qualify for this transitional status, extending deadlines for reaching attainment and removing statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. The ClearSkies proposal introduces a transitional designation for areas, extending deadlines for reaching attainment and removing statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. This change exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years. Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major emitting facility status under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment. This exempts them from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements, as well as ambient air protections unless located near designated national parks. The Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major emitting facility status under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment. This exempts them from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements, as well as ambient air protections unless located near designated national parks or wilderness areas. The Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major emitting facility status under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, including NSR, BART, and BACT requirements. Units near Class I areas remain subject to PSD requirements. Nonattainment areas are exempt from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements, limiting their ability to impose additional controls. Units must demonstrate proper pollution control equipment maintenance and good combustion practices to qualify for exemptions. The Clear Skies proposal allows nonattainment areas to impose additional controls on existing EGUs and opt-in facilities under their State Implementation Plans. Existing affected units must demonstrate proper pollution control equipment maintenance and good combustion practices to qualify for exemptions. Additionally, Clear Skies would revise Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units. Clear Skies proposal aims to minimize emissions of carbon monoxide and revise Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, with exceptions for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. The Administrator would have the authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from EGUs based on public health concerns and emission controls, with a peer-reviewed study required before imposing controls. Any standards imposed could not take effect before January 1, 2018. The Clear Skies proposal would require a peer-reviewed study before imposing emission controls on EGUs for non-mercury hazardous air pollutants. Compliance deadlines for units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from certain hazardous air pollutant regulations. The Clear Skies proposal exempts units opting into the cap-and-trade program from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations. It also introduces changes to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies proposes a moratorium on Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act, with more stringent requirements for acceptance after the moratorium. Section 126 allows downwind states to petition the Administrator regarding upwind sources emitting pollutants. If granted, upwind sources must comply with mandated controls within a specified period. The amendment to Section 126 of the Clean Air Act authorizes downwind states to petition the Administrator regarding upwind sources emitting pollutants. If granted, the upwind sources must either shut down or implement controls mandated by the Administrator within three years. The Administrator cannot require submission of SIPs subjecting affected units to Section 126 requirements before December 31, 2014. Factors considered in reviewing a petition include emissions. The amendment to Section 126 of the Clean Air Act allows downwind states to petition the Administrator regarding upwind sources emitting pollutants. The Administrator cannot require submission of SIPs subjecting affected units to Section 126 requirements before December 31, 2014. Factors considered in reviewing a petition include emissions reductions required for nonattainment areas. The Administrator must consider emissions reductions required for nonattainment areas when reviewing petitions from downwind states regarding upwind sources emitting pollutants. The required emission reductions from affected units must be cost-effective and improve air quality in nonattainment areas. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's existing Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. Penalties were set at $2,000 per ton of excess emissions in 1990, adjusted for inflation. Change in Noncompliance Penalties Under Title IV of Clear Skies would reduce penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program, setting penalties at $2,000 per ton with no inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. The penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program under Clear Skies would be reduced to $2,000 per ton without inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. Additionally, states and their political subdivisions would be prohibited from interfering with the transfer or sale of emissions allowances. Under Clear Skies, states cannot enforce stricter limits than the bill but are prohibited from interfering with the transfer of emissions allowances. This could lead to increased emissions in one jurisdiction offsetting reductions in another. The bill also limits Section 126 petitions to control out-of-state pollution. The Clear Skies bill prohibits states from enforcing stricter emission limits and limits their ability to interfere with emissions allowance transfers. This could result in increased emissions in one jurisdiction offsetting reductions in another. Additionally, the bill eliminates New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs for a 20-year period. The Clear Skies bill exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from New Source Review for Modifications for 20 years. National Emission Standards are established for new EGUs, but not for modified units unless they are reconstructed. Reconstruction is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost to construct a new unit. The bill establishes National Emission Standards for new EGUs, but not for modified units unless they are reconstructed. Reconstruction is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost to construct a new unit. The standards do not apply to reconstructed units unless it is feasible to meet them. There is no specific cost criterion for modifications triggering NSR, but it is generally below a 50% threshold. EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold in 2003 was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold in 2003 for modifications triggering NSR was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Clear Skies would exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years after enactment. Under Section 169A of the Clean Air Act, major sources operating between 1962 and 1977 are subject to BART to protect visibility in national parks. Clear Skies would exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART for 20 years. S. 131 states that new units near Class I areas must comply with PSD requirements. S. 131 requires new units near Class I areas to comply with PSD requirements, which mandate obtaining a new source permit to ensure no adverse impact on visibility. Class I areas within 100 km of the unit's location must be identified for permit application. To affect air quality in a Class I area, obtain a new source permit to ensure no adverse impact on visibility. Regulations require identifying Class I areas within 100 km of the unit's location. Clear Skies exempts units in Class II areas from further emission controls to maintain air quality within specified limits. Clear Skies exempts affected units in Class II areas from having to offset or further control their emissions to maintain air quality within specified limits. It also extends deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS compliance. Clear Skies extends deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS compliance, creating a new \"transitional\" area classification for areas that can demonstrate attainment by December 2015. Transitional areas will not face penalties until that date. A new \"transitional\" area classification is introduced for areas that can show attainment of standards by December 2015. Transitional areas will not face penalties until that date, and if they fail to achieve the standard after 2015, they will be designated nonattainment by June 2017 and must implement controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas will be exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. After 2015, areas failing to meet standards would be designated nonattainment by June 2017 and required to implement controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. Subpart 2 of the Clean Air Act outlines specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas. The Clean Air Act outlines specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including LAER standards, offset requirements for new sources, RACT for existing sources, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery, reformulated gasoline use, and penalties for emissions. EPA proposed to maintain these requirements for areas that fail to meet standards. The Clean Air Act sets requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including LAER standards, offset requirements for new sources, RACT for existing sources, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery, reformulated gasoline use, and penalties for emissions. EPA proposed to maintain these requirements for areas that fail to meet standards, with the possibility of transitional areas rolling back statutory requirements. Under Clear Skies, areas failing to meet ozone standards may qualify as \"transitional\" and avoid nonattainment status. Transitional areas could roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. The elimination of Conformity Requirements under the Clean Air Act affects ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas, requiring conformity for federally funded projects. Failure to demonstrate conformity can have consequences. Under Clear Skies, areas failing to meet ozone standards may qualify as \"transitional\" and avoid nonattainment status. This would eliminate the application of conformity requirements in most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas until 2018. Proposed Clear Skies legislation would make changes to Title I structure. Under Clear Skies, transportation conformity can lead to a suspension of federal funds until demonstrated. Proposed legislation reclassifies most nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" exempting them from conformity until 2018. Changes to Title I structure would affect electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Table 3 outlines the potential modifications under Clear Skies. Under Clear Skies, Title I would undergo structural changes for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. The most significant change would be the removal of location as a variable for controlling EGUs, with emission limitations and allowance system operating regardless of location. The elimination of location as a variable for controlling EGUs is a significant structural change under Clear Skies. This means emission limitations and the allowance system would operate independently of an EGU's location or state/local government restrictions. States' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated. Under Clear Skies, emission limitations and the allowance system for EGUs would operate independently of location or state/local government restrictions. This would eliminate states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas and prevent state and local governments from influencing EGU emissions. Additionally, the state's enforcement mechanism NSR would be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. Under Clear Skies, state and local governments would lose the ability to influence EGU emissions and enforce stringent rules in nonattainment areas. The allowance trading restrictions would prevent extra reductions achieved by state legislation from controlling emissions. Under Clear Skies, states setting stringent standards would not have complete control as allowance trading restrictions prevent extra reductions achieved by state legislation from controlling emissions. This would also limit the ability of states to force neighboring utilities to reduce emissions until after 2014. Part C) of Clear Skies allows the utility to sell additional allowances to upwind utilities not covered by state legislation. The state cannot prevent these sales or seek relief through a Section 126 petition until after 2014. The legislation aims to reduce the need for stronger state and local standards by creating a transitional designation for areas not meeting air quality standards. Clear Skies aims to establish a transitional designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, potentially eliminating the need for stronger state and local standards by 2015. This designation would prevent the areas from being considered nonattainment, thus avoiding the requirement for additional controls. Clear Skies aims to establish a transitional designation for areas not meeting air quality standards by December 2015, potentially eliminating the need for additional controls. The legislation also includes measures to protect Class I areas within 50 km of facilities. States and localities face constraints in protecting areas that do not meet Clear Skies' requirements. The Clear Skies legislation aims to establish a transitional designation for areas not meeting air quality standards by December 2015. It includes measures to protect Class I areas within 50 km of facilities, but states and localities face constraints in meeting requirements for areas not meeting Clear Skies' standards. The controversy over EGU age remains unresolved by Clear Skies, with stringent requirements placed on new sources. Clear Skies legislation aims to reduce disparities in emissions control requirements for existing and new sources. Existing sources operate with fewer controls, but Clear Skies would establish allowance reserves for new sources. Allocation formulas are more generous for existing sources, while new sources receive allowances on a first-come, first-serve basis. Clear Skies legislation aims to reduce disparities in emissions control requirements by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. Existing sources have more generous allocation formulas, giving them an advantage over new facilities in receiving allowances. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Existing sources have an advantage over new facilities in receiving allowances under Clear Skies legislation. Once the reserve is depleted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies, indicating that new or existing Electric Generating Units would no longer be subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards or residual risk standards. Table 4 provides an overview of the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards and residual risk standards would no longer apply to new or existing Electric Generating Units or other industrial sources opting into the cap-and-trade program. This absence of unit-specific standards could make it challenging to address areas with higher concentrations of mercury. States could choose to set more stringent standards under their own regulations. The absence of unit-specific standards under Clear Skies would make it difficult to address \"hot spots\" with high mercury concentrations. States setting more stringent standards would not have complete control, as allowance trading could create additional allowances for utilities to sell to upwind facilities not covered by state legislation. The Clean Air Act allows states to set more stringent standards, but they would not have full control due to allowance trading. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under strict conditions, including a peer-reviewed study on public health concerns. Standards cannot be implemented before 2018. The state's legislation does not cover the sale, allowing it to proceed. The Administrator has the authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under strict conditions, including a peer-reviewed study on public health concerns. Former Administrator Whitman questions if Clear Skies' targets are stringent enough to relax or remove provisions of the Clean Air Act for electric utilities. Former Administrator Whitman has raised concerns about whether Clear Skies' targets are stringent enough to allow for the relaxing or removal of provisions in the Clean Air Act for electric utilities. Clear Skies will not meet the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines, according to EPA's analysis. Clear Skies will not achieve the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines, as it lacks the necessary reductions and timing. Some nonattainment areas will require additional controls and time to reach attainment. The current draft of Clear Skies would remove electric utility control options for states and the opt-in provision's reach is unclear. The Clear Skies proposal may hinder states' ability to achieve NAAQS attainment by limiting control options for electric utilities and creating uncertainty with the opt-in provision. Mercury controls under Clear Skies could also pose challenges, especially in states with fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. The Clear Skies proposal could limit control options for electric utilities, affecting states' ability to achieve NAAQS attainment. Mercury controls may also be challenging, especially in states with fish consumption advisories due to contamination. Clear Skies proposal may limit state control options for reducing mercury emissions, impacting states with fish consumption advisories due to contamination. Administration argues Clear Skies will achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act. The Clear Skies program may limit state control options for reducing mercury emissions, impacting states with fish consumption advisories. The Administration argues that Clear Skies will achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act, despite extending compliance deadlines for states. The Clear Skies program, compared to the Clean Air Act, may limit state control options for reducing mercury emissions. Clear Skies extends compliance deadlines for states to achieve air quality standards, allowing for more flexibility in compliance strategies. However, early reductions under a cap-and-trade program may lead to increased emissions in the future, complicating long-term reduction goals for state and local authorities."
