    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Congress rejected proposals to terminate the program in previous budgets and provided funding to continue it. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine was developed as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine for the F-35 fighter. Despite Congress rejecting proposals to terminate the program in previous budgets, funding for the alternate engine program was eliminated in the final FY2011 DOD budget. General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the termination of the F136 engine development on December 2, 2011, ending the F-35 engine competition. The budget submission proposed to terminate the alternate engine program, and Congress eliminated funding for it in the final FY2011 DOD budget. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine, terminating the F-35 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the JSF competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the JSF competition in 2001. Congress required development of an alternate engine, the F136, which was later terminated in FY2011. The F136 engine, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce for the F-35, was designed to be used interchangeably with the F135 engine without modifying the airframe. Despite proposed terminations by the Administration in multiple fiscal years, Congress restored funding for the alternate engine program. The F136 engine, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce for the F-35, faced proposed terminations by the Administration in multiple fiscal years. However, Congress restored funding for the program due to the progress of the main engine and cost analysis. Despite this, funding for the alternate engine program was eventually deleted in FY2011, leading to its formal termination by DOD on April 25, 2011. In FY2011, the 112th Congress terminated funding for the F136 engine program, which was formally ended by DOD on April 25, 2011. Supporters of the termination argue that developing a second engine for the F-35 would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured within the budget. Procuring a second engine for the F-35 would greatly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be acquired within the budget. This would lead to cuts in future capabilities and force structure, potentially reducing F-35 procurement by 50 to 80 aircraft over the next five years. Additionally, maintaining two engine maintenance and repair pipelines would raise F-35 life-cycle operation and support costs. The reduction in F-35 procurement over the next five years could total 50 to 80 aircraft. Procuring a second engine would increase costs and maintenance challenges, particularly for aircraft carriers. International interest in the F-35 is already strong without the need for a second engine. Having a second engine on aircraft carriers for the F-35 is challenging due to limited space and facilities. International interest in the F-35 is strong without the need for a second engine, as potential buyers are already committed to the program. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets for both powerplants and airframes. The F-35's capabilities, procurement cost, and operating and support cost are reasons for interest. Congress and DOD accept the risk of using single designs for powerplants and airframes, including the F-35 engines. Development and production of the F135 engine have progressed to a point where hedging against technical problems is no longer necessary. The risk of fleet grounding due to design flaws is acceptable to Congress and DOD for airframe design, including F-35 engines. Development of the F135 engine has advanced to a point where a backup engine program is no longer necessary despite past test failures. Opponents argue against terminating the alternate engine program. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F135 engine faces opposition due to concerns about compliance with the FY2008 defense authorization act. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F135 engine is in violation of the FY2008 defense authorization act, which mandates the development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter Program. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for 2 propulsion system options for the Joint Strike Fighter Program to avoid reliance on a single engine type for the F-35 fleet. Having a second engine option for the Joint Strike Fighter Program is crucial to avoid reliance on a single engine type for the F-35 fleet, which could lead to grounding all aircraft in case of engine issues. This approach would introduce competition in engine procurement, potentially reducing costs compared to sole-source procurement. Having a second engine in production for the F-35 program would introduce competition, potentially reducing costs and promoting better engine performance and reliability. It would also allow for quicker production surges if needed. Having a second engine in production for the F-35 program would introduce competition, potentially reducing costs and promoting better engine performance and reliability. It would also allow for quicker production surges if needed, sustaining international interest and maximizing exports. Having a second engine in production for the F-35 program would introduce competition, potentially reducing costs and promoting better engine performance and reliability. It would also sustain international interest and maximize exports by offering potential foreign buyers a choice in engines. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, with all tooling and engines ordered to be returned. Over $200 million in F136 hardware is located in 17 facilities. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, with all tooling and engines ordered to be returned. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine on December 2, 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for related work from FY1994-FY2009. On December 2, 2011, General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the termination of their self-funded development of the F136 engine. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for work related to the F-35 program, including $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) work. The $7.3 billion funding for the F-35 program included $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) work. The estimated cost of the F135 SDD contract increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion during the period FY1995-FY2009. The cost of the F135 SDD contract increased from $4.8 billion to $6.7 billion by September 2009, with $0.8 billion attributed to cost growth and $1.1 billion to an expanded scope of work. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion from FY1995-FY2009, including $1.7 billion for SDD work on the F136 engine from FY2005-FY2009. The F136 team's efforts did not include certain components developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 engine team received $2.4 billion from FY1995-FY2009, with $1.7 billion allocated for SDD work. The F136 contract did not cover STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. This resulted in fewer test hours and ground test engines for the F136 engine. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines compared to the F135 contract. During a period of continuing resolutions, questions arose about the funding of the alternate engine program due to the Administration's opposition. During a period of continuing resolutions, questions arose about the funding of the alternate engine program due to the Administration's opposition. The government operated under CRs, which prohibited spending on new starts or procurement rates above FY2010 levels. P.L. 111-242 set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act for the base budget and military construction levels. The CR effective through March 4, 2011, set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act for the base budget and military construction levels. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would continue funding activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act and FY2010 Supplemental (P.L. 111-212) funded activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that Congress added $1.8 billion for the program. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that Congress added $1.8 billion for the program, stating that there is little advantage to the taxpayer of having a second engine. Congress has allocated $1.8 billion for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years. However, analysis shows little benefit to taxpayers as most customers will only purchase one engine due to logistical constraints. The Air Force is the only potential customer for a competitive bid. The European partners are likely to buy the European engine or Rolls-Royce GE engine. The Marine Corps and Navy will only take one airplane due to limited logistics on ships. The Air Force is the only potential customer for a competitive bid on the F135 engine program, which has completed 13,000 hours of testing. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, with concerns about encountering similar development problems as the first engine. The F135 engine program for the Air Force is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only undergone 50 hours of testing, raising concerns about facing similar development issues as the first engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine due to potential logistical challenges and remaining development work. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to potential logistical challenges and remaining development work. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley questioned the need for a second engine for the F-35, citing logistical challenges and ongoing development work. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz emphasized the advancements in engine technology over the years and the potential trade-off between more engines and fewer F-35 aircraft. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz testified about the technological progress in engine design and production, highlighting the potential trade-off between more engines and fewer F-35 aircraft. He also mentioned the reliability of single-engine airplanes like the F-22 and F-18E/F, expressing comfort with their respective engines. General Schwartz commented on funding for the alternate engine on October 12, 2010. General Schwartz expressed comfort with the reliability of single-engine airplanes like the F-22 and F-18E/F. He commented on funding for the alternate engine, suggesting that Rolls and GE should contribute more towards the cost. Adm. Gary Roughead supported the use of one engine on carriers. General Schwartz and Adm. Gary Roughead expressed support for single-engine airplanes like the F-22 and F-18E/F. Schwartz suggested Rolls and GE should contribute more to the cost of the alternate engine. Adm. Roughead favored one engine on carriers. Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright questioned the value of the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, proposing the purchase of more Predators instead. Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright questions the need for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, suggesting that the funds could be better spent on purchasing more Predators. He argues that having a second engine manufacturer would allow for competition and cost savings in the long run. The need for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter is questioned by Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright, who suggests that funds could be better spent on purchasing more Predators. He argues that having a second engine manufacturer would allow for competition and potential cost savings in the long run. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter was no longer needed as a hedge against failure and that financial benefits from competition were assessed to be small. The Office of Management and Budget proposed terminating the FY2010 program for the alternative engine of the Joint Strike Fighter, citing that it was no longer necessary as a backup and that the financial benefits of competition were minimal. The cancellation was expected to result in over a billion dollars in near-term savings. The Office of Management and Budget proposed terminating the FY2010 program for the alternative engine of the Joint Strike Fighter, citing high costs and minimal financial benefits from competition. The cancellation was expected to result in over a billion dollars in near-term savings. GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield enough savings to offset the costs of competition over the JSF program's life, but continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The GAO testified that competitive pressures could offset costs over the JSF program's life. Continuing the alternate engine program may require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. A competitive strategy could result in savings exceeding that amount, similar to the \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s. The GAO stated that a competitive strategy could lead to savings equal to or exceeding the additional investment required for the alternate engine program. The \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s resulted in significant savings across acquisition, operations, and overall life cycle costs. Nonfinancial benefits such as better performance and increased reliability may also result from competition. The GAO found that a competitive strategy could lead to significant savings in acquisition and support costs, with a total of 21 percent in overall life cycle costs. Nonfinancial benefits like better performance and increased reliability may also result from competition. Cost has been a major issue in the debate over the alternate engine, with proponents arguing for cost control through competition. The Administration, however, believes the costs of a second engine outweigh the benefits. Cost has been a significant issue in the alternate engine debate, with proponents arguing for cost control through competition. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135 engine. Secretary Gates acknowledged cost growth in developmental aircraft but emphasized the need for program risk reduction. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135 engine, prompting Secretary Gates to allocate over $4 billion in the FY '10 budget to reduce program risk. The creation of a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) was also announced to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure. In July 2009, the DOD created a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues related to the F135 engine. The team's charter included understanding production costs, cost drivers, and developing a plan for long-term affordability. The team aims to address issues without funding a second engine. The Joint Assessment Team (JAT) was created by the DOD to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues related to the F135 engine. The team's charter included understanding production costs, cost drivers, and developing a plan for long-term affordability. The team aims to address issues without funding a second engine. The JAT's assessment results have not been shared with CRS, but a Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. Defense Department officials believe this supports their decision to reject the second engine. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. Defense Department officials believe this supports their decision to reject the second engine proposal. The Pentagon study showed that adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as the single-source plan, supporting their decision to reject proposals for General Electric and Rolls-Royce's F136 engine. The memo explains that the costs of a competitive engine strategy are equivalent to a sole-source scenario, with no compelling business case for two competing F-35 engine programs. The memo sent to lawmakers on Feb. 25 acknowledges that development work on the F136 engine has reduced costs, but still concludes that having two competing F-35 engine programs is not cost-effective. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional F135 engines and production improvements in February 2011. In February 2011, Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional F135 engines and production improvements for the F-35. Approximately $400 million was allocated for engine improvements, with a third aimed at meeting the original specification and two-thirds for exceeding it, especially for the vertical-lift F-35B. The DOD allocated approximately $400 million for engine improvements in the F-35 program, with a third aimed at meeting the original specification and two-thirds for exceeding it. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act directed three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were directed by Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act. The studies, conducted by CAIG, IDA, and GAO in 2007, used the same data but reached different conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits were also cited. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were conducted in 2007 by CAIG, IDA, and GAO. They used the same data provided by the JSF program office and contractors but reached different conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits such as improvements in fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of industrial base, and stronger international relations were also highlighted. The CAIG study specifically looked at the engine competition for the Air Force F-16 fighter program. The CAIG study examined non-financial benefits of an engine competition, including fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of industrial base, and international relations. It looked at engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 fighter program, Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 strike fighter program, and sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The CAIG study analyzed the benefits of engine competition for military programs, including the F-16, F/A-18, and F-22. It assumed favorable outcomes for dual sourcing and predicted a 5% price decrease in engine procurement costs with competition. The CAIG study assumed favorable conditions for dual sourcing in the F-35 engine competition, predicting a 5% price decrease in engine procurement costs and a steeper reduction in production costs over time. It estimated a 21.1% reduction in engine costs over the program's lifetime to break even. The CAIG study estimated that an F-35 engine competition would need to achieve a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs in constant FY2002 dollars over the lifetime of the program to break even. On a net-present-value (NPV) basis, the study found the procurement-cost reduction required for break-even would be 25.6%. The study estimated that DOD would be unable to recoup its initial investment in the alternate engine development program through procurement savings alone. The CAIG study found that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve a 25.6% cost reduction for a break-even point by 2040. The report was skeptical that this savings could be reached even with competition on O&S contracts. The CAIG study highlighted the need for DOD to compete engine O&S contracts to achieve a 25.6% cost reduction by 2040. Despite skepticism about reaching this savings target through competition, the study also discussed non-financial benefits and growth potential in the F-35 engine. The CAIG study discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating weight growth between Critical Design Review and Initial Operational Capability, which would require a corresponding increase in engine thrust. Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine was nearing its temperature limits, necessitating modifications for additional thrust compared to the F136 engine. The CAIG study highlighted the need for increased engine thrust in the F-35 due to weight growth, with Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine nearing its temperature limits. The IDA study examined engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating potential savings of 11% to 18% in an F-35 engine competition. The IDA study analyzed engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, projecting 11% to 18% savings in an F-35 engine competition. It estimated an alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars, with no feasible way to recoup the investment through procurement-cost savings. IDA study found that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. To break even on an NPV basis, a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed, which was deemed unrealistic. If engine O&S contracts were also competed, the required savings would decrease to 18%. The IDA study found that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. To break even on an NPV basis, a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed, which was deemed unrealistic. The study also mentioned that contractor responsiveness was the primary motivation for the Great Engine War, and that F-35s are expected to constitute 95% of the U.S. fighter/strike-fighter force by 2035. The IDA study found that contractor responsiveness was the primary motivation for the Great Engine War, and that having an alternate engine for the F-35 could mitigate risks of fleet grounding. Enhanced industry responsiveness from competitive forces could improve fleet readiness. The GAO study suggested procurement-cost savings of 10.3% to 12.3%. The GAO study suggested that an alternate engine for the F-35 could prevent fleet grounding and improve readiness. It stated that cost savings of 10.3% to 12.3% would be needed for the program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20% from engine competitions. The study concluded that competing the engine could recoup investment costs. The study suggested that a savings of 10.3% to 12.3% would be required for the alternate engine program to break even on its investment costs. It also mentioned potential financial savings of up to 20% from engine competitions. The GAO's director believed the program would reach its break-even point by the late 2020s. The DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the alternate engine program for its non-financial benefits. The GAO's director, Michael Sullivan, believed the alternate engine program would break even by the late 2020s. Despite marginal financial benefits, the DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the program for its non-financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run can impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for the alternate engine program. The size of the F-35 production run can influence the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement numbers and engine choices will impact the production run size over many years. The size of the F-35 production run will be influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement numbers and engine choices, which can change over many years due to international security environment and defense budgets. On September 1, 2009, the GE/Rolls-Royce team reportedly offered to build F136 engines. The F-35 production run size is uncertain due to changes in international security and defense budgets. GE/Rolls-Royce offered fixed-price F136 engines, while Pratt & Whitney proposed reducing F135 prices after the initial lots. GE/Rolls-Royce offered a fixed-price contract for F136 engines, while Pratt & Whitney proposed a cost-plus contract for F135 engines after the initial lots. DOD agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s to equip F-35s under Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs 16% lower than the previous lot. A fixed-price contract for F135 engines was agreed upon by Pratt & Whitney and DOD for F-35s under Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs 16% lower than the previous lot. A Memorandum of Understanding between the United States and eight other countries on the production, sustainment, and follow-on development of the JSF was signed on November 14, 2006. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the United States and eight other countries on the production, sustainment, and follow-on development of the JSF Air System includes the production of the JSF Air Vehicle and propulsion systems. The Air Force confirmed that the MOU has not been superseded or changed. The JSF Air System work includes production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The MOU scope of work for JSF SDD includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems subject to funding availability. The MOU scope of work for JSF SDD includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems subject to funding availability, with the provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remaining valid. The Department will continue to fulfill its obligations under the MOU, engaging in consultations with partners regarding the exclusion of F136 from RDT&E funding requests. No amendments are planned. The Department will continue to implement its obligations under the JSF SDD and PSFD MOU, including cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136, subject to funding availability. Consultations have been held with partners regarding the exclusion of F136 from RDT&E funding requests. No amendments are planned to the MOUs. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs are securing more F-35-related contracts. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs are securing more F-35-related contracts. The position of partner nations on the need for the second engine may change based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence supports the F136 engine. The partner nations' position on the second engine for the F-35 program may change based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence supports the F136 engine, expressing concerns about potential long-term costs if the second engine is canceled. Both JSF engines have faced development challenges, including failures during ground testing. The decision to cancel the second engine for the F-35 program may save money in the short term but could cost the U.S. and its partners more in the long term. Both JSF engines have experienced development challenges, with failures during ground testing due to high-cycle fatigue. On February 4, 2008, the F135 engine failed during ground testing due to high-cycle fatigue, resulting in a turbine blade failure. The engine failures caused delays in the first flight of the F-35B aircraft by a month or two and contributed to an $850 million cost overrun in the F135 program. Additionally, an F135 engine was damaged in a test on September 11, 2009, attributed to a worn bushing by Pratt & Whitney. The F135 engine failures caused delays in the first flight of the F-35B aircraft by a month or two and led to an $850 million cost overrun. An F135 engine was damaged in a test on September 11, 2009, due to a worn bushing, according to Pratt & Whitney. The damage to the F136 engine was attributed to a worn bushing, leading to damage on fan blades. A minor modification will be made to all initial service release production engines. The F136 engine has encountered three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage on turbine blades due to a loose nut. The F136 engine has encountered three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage on turbine blades due to a loose nut. In September 2010, damage to the fan and compressor led to a design change to prevent recurrence. In September 2010, an F136 engine sustained damage to its fan and compressor, leading to a design change. In April 2011, some F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue identified in a ground-test engine. Pratt & Whitney confirms that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares since March due to a misassembly issue identified in a ground-test engine at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney in July 2009 for quality control deficiencies leading to increased F135 costs. Pratt & Whitney found mis-assembled engines after a ground test, leading to quality control criticisms from Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz in July 2009. Heinz highlighted a 24% cost increase in F135 engines due to scrap and rework issues. The 24% growth in F135 costs was attributed to scrap and rework issues. Pratt & Whitney stated that only a few parts had a high scrap rate, with an overall engine scrap rate of 97%. Pratt & Whitney responded to high scrap rates by stating that only a few parts were affected, with an overall engine scrap rate of 97%. William Begert, VP of business development, mentioned reaching 70-80% yield rate on some parts. General Electric F136 achieved 115% thrust in testing. Pratt & Whitney planned tests for a higher-thrust F135 in January 2011. A General Electric F136 engine achieved 115% of required thrust in testing. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue or end the program. Congressional appropriations have supported the program from various funding sources. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, leading Congress to decide whether to continue or end the program. Congressional appropriations have supported the program from various funding sources, including existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from within the DOD topline. The source of funds may impact other DOD programs. The alternate engine program has drawn funds from various sources, including existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from within the DOD topline. It is unclear how much of the topline increases were allocated to the program, which could impact other DOD programs. Allocating funds from the existing F-35 budget lines for the alternate engine program may result in curtailing other F-35 activities. The allocation of funds for the alternate engine program within the existing F-35 budget lines may impact other F-35 activities and potentially force the transfer of funds from other defense programs to F-35. The program executive officer (PEO) of the Marine Corps plans to cut 50-80 tails from the program over the next five years. Increasing funding for the alternate engine in the F-35 program without increasing the overall DOD budget could lead to transferring funds from other defense programs to the F-35. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program, potentially impacting the number of F-35s procured or causing delays in the program. The Marine Corps plans to reduce tails from the F-35 program. Congress may need to decide on continuing the alternate engine program, which could impact F-35 procurement or cause program delays. Additional funding of $2.9 billion over six years is needed for engine development. The DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost the same as one engine due to congressional appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion over six years is needed for F136 engine development, as stated in a 2010 DOD letter and a GAO report. The DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost the same as one engine due to congressional appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion over six years is needed for F136 engine development, as stated in a 2010 DOD letter and a GAO report. The $2.9 billion figure for F136 development lacks precision and could change based on different assumptions. The $2.9 billion funding projection for developing the F136 engine may vary based on different assumptions, with potential impacts on the current budget year and lifetime costs. Competing studies disagree on whether the upfront cost can be balanced out by savings from competition. Congress will need to decide which assumptions to believe regarding the effects of competition on cost. The upfront cost of developing the F136 engine may be balanced over its lifetime by savings from competition, a point of disagreement in studies. Congress must decide which assumptions to trust regarding competition's impact on cost. Competition is seen as a check on cost growth, with contracts negotiated based on past experiences to establish prices. Competition is viewed as a check on cost growth in defense procurement. Advocates of alternate engine procurement argue that competition can help control costs. Congress must weigh the fleet-grounding risk of a single engine type for the F-35 against the potential benefits of procuring a second engine. Incentives and penalties are considered for contractors to meet cost targets. The debate revolves around the risk of grounding the F-35 fleet due to a single engine type, with some advocating for a second engine to mitigate this risk. The grounding of 106 AV-8B Harriers in 2000 due to a faulty engine bearing is cited as an example of potential risks. The majority of future U.S. fighters will be F-35s, raising concerns about the risk of all F-35s being grounded if there is a problem with the single engine type. Engine issues have led to groundings of AV-8B Harriers, Navy aircraft, and Air Force fleets in the past.

These actions were taken to meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. Based on the original baseline, actions taken for a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) will meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. This applies only to the extent that designation as a major subprogram would necessitate reassessment and actions by the Secretary of Defense. The requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, apply to a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) only if it would require the Secretary of Defense to reassess and take actions. If programmatic changes cause the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost to increase by a certain threshold after the enactment of this Act, the requirements of section 2433a would not be considered met for that subprogram. The requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, apply to a major subprogram only if programmatic changes cause the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost to increase by a certain threshold after the enactment of this Act. The report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language regarding the F-35 alternate engine program. The report accompanying H.R. 5136, H.Rept. 111-491, includes details on the F-35 alternate engine program. The budget request contained funds for development of the F-35 aircraft but not for a competitive propulsion system. Additionally, funds were allocated for the procurement of various F-35 aircraft models. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136. The budget request included funds for the development of the F-35 aircraft but not for a competitive propulsion system. It also allocated funds for the procurement of various F-35 aircraft models. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is working on the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee has recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system for the past four years, with funds appropriated by Congress for this purpose. The F136 engine is being developed as a competitive alternative to the F135 engine for the F-35 aircraft. Despite Congress appropriating funds for the competitive propulsion system for the past four years, the Department of Defense has not complied with the requirement to support its development. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not complied with the requirement to support the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35, as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act. The Department of Defense has failed to comply with the law by not including funds for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year. Cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines have been noted, with the GAO reporting a 50 percent increase in F135 engine development costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported a 50 percent increase in F135 engine development costs, with the F-35B engine and lift fan negotiated price 21 percent higher than budgeted in fiscal year 2009. The F-35A engine negotiated unit cost was 42 percent higher than budgeted. The F135 engine contract for fiscal year 2009 saw a 21 percent higher negotiated price for the F-35B engine and lift fan, and a 42 percent higher negotiated unit cost for the F-35A engine. A Joint Assessment Team (JAT) reviewed the cost structure and concluded that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. The Joint Assessment Team (JAT) reviewed the F135 cost structure and found that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. The Deputy Secretary of Defense noted that an investment of $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to finish F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35. The Defense committee received an update on the 2007 DOD report for the competitive engine program, stating that $2.9 billion over six years is needed to complete F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The report also highlighted that long-term costs for a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy are the same.

Long-term costs for a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy are the same. The committee questions the Department's decisions to not include a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy in its budget requests. The committee questions the Department's decisions to not include a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy in its budget requests, favoring a two-engine competitive program for better engine performance and operational readiness. They recommend a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program to improve F-35 performance, contractor responsiveness, industrial base robustness, engine reliability, and operational readiness. The F-35 program faced challenges in meeting cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews by the Department of Defense. The F-35 program, facing challenges in cost and schedule performance, underwent reviews by the Department of Defense. The Joint Estimating Team (JET) and an independent manufacturing review team (IMRT) were involved in assessing the program's development and production. JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and increased costs for the F-35 program. The Department of Defense conducted a 2009 update to the 2008 Joint Estimating Team (JET) known as JET 2, which estimated a 30-month delay and increased costs for the F-35 program. An independent manufacturing review team (IMRT) also concluded that the contractor's planned production ramp rates were high risk and not achievable within the planned timeframe. To mitigate risks, the Department of Defense proposes to procure an additional F-35C developmental test aircraft and implement additional software. The Department of Defense proposes measures to reduce risks in the F-35 program, including procuring an additional test aircraft, setting up a software simulation facility, adjusting production rates, and increasing budget for development and production. These actions aim to address a 30-month delay and cost increase estimated by the Independent Manufacturing Review Team. The Department of Defense plans to mitigate risks in the F-35 program by acquiring an extra test aircraft, establishing a software simulation facility, adjusting production rates, and boosting the budget for development and production. These actions are expected to delay the completion of F-35 development by 13 months and incur an additional cost of $2.8 billion. The Secretary of the Air Force notified the committee that the F-35 program will surpass unit cost thresholds by over 50% compared to the original baseline. The F-35 program is facing delays of 13 months and an extra cost of $2.8 billion. The Secretary of the Air Force informed the committee that the program will exceed unit cost thresholds by more than 50%. The Under Secretary of Defense described the program as having unprecedented concurrency of development, test, and production activities. The F-35 program is facing delays and increased costs. Testimonies before Senate committees highlighted issues with late delivery of test aircraft and failure to adjust to reality in building and resourcing. The F-35 program is facing delays and increased costs, with issues highlighted in testimonies before Senate committees regarding late delivery of test aircraft and failure to adjust to reality in building and resourcing. The F-35 program is experiencing delays and cost increases, with plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The Department intends to request a total of 550 aircraft by spring 2015, representing over 22 percent of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s before developmental testing is finished. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft costing $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite delays and cost increases, they intend to request a total of 550 aircraft by spring 2015, which is over 22 percent of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s before testing is finished. The committee expresses concerns about the F-35 aircraft procurement despite ongoing testing and development. The risk of required design changes could lead to costly retrofitting of already produced aircraft. The committee remains concerned about the F-35 aircraft procurement, citing significant risks and impacts from required design changes. They recommend reducing the production ramp rate until developmental testing is complete, with a budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011. The committee recommends reducing the F-35 production ramp rate due to significant risks and impacts from design changes. They suggest authorizing the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones by the Department. A provision is recommended to certify milestone completion before releasing necessary funds. The committee recommends a provision to certify completion of certain milestones before procuring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The Administration opposes adding $485 million for the extra engine program. The Administration strongly opposes adding $485 million for the extra engine program and legislative provisions that limit JSF development funding until funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program. The Administration opposes additional funding for the extra engine program and legislative provisions that restrict JSF development funding until funds for FY 2011 have been allocated. Secretary Gates stated that even with Congress' extra funding, the extra engine would still need a $2.4 billion investment to be viable for the JSF program. The Department opposes additional funding for the extra engine program, stating that it would require a $2.4 billion investment to be viable for the JSF program. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, the President will need to make a decision. The Department opposes additional funding for the extra engine program, stating that it would require a $2.4 billion investment to be viable for the JSF program. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. The report accompanying S. 3454 included a certification requirement prior to expenditure of further funding for the alternate engine. The President's senior advisors would recommend a veto for additional funding for the extra engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. A certification requirement is included before spending more funds on the alternate propulsion system. The committee recommends a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the development of the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs, improve operational readiness, and not disrupt the program before spending additional funds on the F136 engine. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program aims to reduce costs and improve operational readiness without disrupting the program or reducing the number of aircraft procured. H.R. 6523 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011, H.R. 6523, did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding the program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding H.R. 6523, which included an amended version designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft as a major subprogram within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Milestone B decision will serve as the original baseline for reporting requirements. The Secretary of Defense designates the F-35 engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram. The Milestone B decision is used as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Actions may be taken following critical cost growth. The Secretary of Defense designates the F-35 engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram, with the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. If restructuring occurs after reassessment and actions in fiscal year 2010, the requirements for a major subprogram under section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, will be considered met. The F-35 engine development and procurement program is designated as a major subprogram by the Secretary of Defense, with the Milestone B decision serving as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Actions taken in accordance with this designation will be considered to meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, for the major subprogram. Actions taken in accordance with paragraph (1) will meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, for a major subprogram designated by the Secretary of Defense. However, if programmatic changes post-enactment increase the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost by a certain percentage, the requirements of section 2433a will not be considered met for that subprogram. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 program. If programmatic changes cause the cost of a subprogram to increase by a certain percentage post-enactment, it will not meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $450 million for the F-35 program. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee added funds for the F-35 alternate engine by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version of the Act did not include funds for the alternate engine program. The report included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, added by a vote of 11-5. The House and Senate did not pass a separate defense bill for FY2011, but a continuing resolution maintained spending at FY2010 levels. The F-35 alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels, including funding for the F-35 alternate engine program. However, on February 16, 2011, the House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the alternate engine program as part of a proposed continuing resolution for FY2011. On February 16, 2011, the House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program as part of the FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided DOD funding for the remainder of FY2011, excluding funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in establishing an F-35 alternate engine program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. Historians attribute the Air Force's pursuit of an alternate engine for the F-16 to frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management of the F100 development and concerns about relying on a single engine type for their fighter fleet. The Air Force pursued an alternate engine for the F-16 due to frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management of the F100 and concerns about relying on a single engine type for their fighter fleet. Congress funded General Electric to develop the F110 engine as an alternative, spending over $376 million on the project. The Air Force sought an alternate engine for their F-16 fleet, leading to funding for General Electric to develop the F110 engine as a competitor to the F100. Congress allocated over $376 million for this project, aiming to improve engine durability and reliability. Annual competitions for engine procurement were introduced, sparking debate over their effectiveness in producing better engines at lower costs. The Air Force allocated over $376 million to develop the F110 engine as a competitor to the F100. Annual competitions for engine procurement were introduced, sparking debate over their effectiveness in producing better engines at lower costs. The introduction of annual competitions for engine procurement generated benefits for the Department of Defense, including better contract terms, warranties, and long-term support stability. This competition was believed to improve contractor responsiveness rather than just saving money. The Great Engine War between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for annual production and support work benefited the DOD with improved contract terms, warranties, and long-term support stability. The competition led to earlier engine improvements by the incumbent, Pratt & Whitney, showcasing the benefits of competitive management. The Great Engine War between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney resulted in the incumbent, Pratt & Whitney, offering engine improvements to the Air Force earlier than expected. The Air Force demanded six years of cost projections from both contractors before awarding the first contract. General Electric and Pratt & Whitney provided six years of cost projections for engine production, support equipment, spare engines, technical data, and dual sourcing data for operations and support (O&S). The Air Force awarded six years of firm-fixed price contracts based on these projections, a first in the industry. Prior to the Great Engine War, government negotiated firm-fixed price contracts only after the engine had been in operation for years. Contractors agreed to provide cost projections into the future for the first time, with contracts typically for production only. To avoid disruptions and protect against price gouging, DOD required contractors to provide plans for dual sourcing critical parts. This allowed the government to reprocure spare parts from sources other than the prime contractors. The DOD required contractors to provide plans for dual sourcing critical parts to avoid disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. This decision was made jointly by GE and Rolls-Royce leadership, recognizing the challenges impacting the potential benefits of continuing the development effort. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to end self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. The U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program, and despite offering to continue funding until 2012, the FET will now cease development work. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team terminated self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter after the U.S. Department of Defense ended the program. Despite offering to continue funding until 2012, the FET will now cease development work. The F136 engine had accumulated over 1,200 hours of testing before the program was terminated. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team terminated development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter after the program was ended by the U.S. Department of Defense. The F136 engine had accumulated over 1,200 hours of testing and consistently delivered on cost and schedule. GE and Rolls-Royce were leading advocates of defense acquisition reform during the program. The F136 engine, developed by the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team, underwent 1,200 hours of successful testing since early 2009. The joint venture between GE and Rolls-Royce received high marks from the DoD for delivering on cost and schedule. Both companies advocated for defense acquisition reform and emphasized the importance of competition in the JSF program."
