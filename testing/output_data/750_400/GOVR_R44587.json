    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, the Independent Safety Board Act made NTSB independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main role is determining accident causes. The Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 made the NTSB completely independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB determines accident causes, recommends safety improvements, assists victims' families in disasters, and serves as a board of appeals for transportation regulatory actions. The NTSB investigates accidents, recommends safety improvements, assists victims' families, and serves as a board of appeals for transportation regulatory actions. It does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices in the transportation sector. The NTSB, consisting of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, does not have the authority to enforce its safety recommendations or regulate transportation safety practices. Its responsibilities are assigned to DOT modal agencies like FAA and the Federal Railroad Administration. The NTSB has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK, along with a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB, with a five-member board and around 420 staff, has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK, as well as a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to have at least one full-time employee in states located more than 1,000 miles from a regional office, impacting Hawaii where the NTSB lacks a field office. The NTSB, with regional offices in multiple states, is required by the NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 to have at least one full-time employee in states more than 1,000 miles from a regional office. This impacts Hawaii, where the NTSB does not have a field office. Currently, the NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii, and the agency's regional staff are dispersed in 25 states. The NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii and regional staff in 25 states. Safety Board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacements are appointed. Not more than three members can be from the same party, and at least three must have technical qualifications. The NTSB board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacements are appointed. No more than three members can be from the same party, and at least three must have technical qualifications. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode, with the office of research and engineering supporting all modal offices. The NTSB also acts as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. The NTSB has separate offices for each transportation mode, with the Office of Research and Engineering supporting all modal offices. It also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. Additionally, there is an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications that tracks responses to safety recommendations and coordinates communications with Congress. The NTSB's Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications coordinates communications with Congress, transportation stakeholders, and the public regarding Board actions and transportation safety advocacy. They track correspondence and actions taken in response to safety recommendations. The NTSB coordinates communications with Congress, transportation stakeholders, and the public regarding Board actions and transportation safety advocacy. They investigate various transportation-related accidents and safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving aircraft, highways, railroads, pipelines, and marine casualties in the United States and its territories. They also look into catastrophic accidents or recurring safety problems as needed. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents on U.S. waters or involving U.S.-flag vessels, excluding public vessels. They rely on experts from manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies through the \"party process\" for investigations. The NTSB utilizes the \"party process\" to involve experts from manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies in investigations. Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings. The NTSB utilizes the \"party process\" to involve experts from various entities in investigations, with safeguards in place to prevent external influence on findings and conclusions. Interested parties can provide technical expertise and submit analyses for consideration, but NTSB bases its conclusions strictly on its own staff's analysis and recommendations. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration or modification of investigative findings after the final report is adopted. The NTSB allows experts from various entities to participate in investigations through the \"party process\", but bases its conclusions solely on its own staff's analysis. Parties can petition for reconsideration of findings after the final report is adopted, with no specific right to hold party status. The Safety Board must meet in public on most matters under the Government in the Sunshine Act. The NTSB allows experts to participate in investigations through the \"party process\", but bases conclusions on its own staff's analysis. Parties can petition for reconsideration of findings after the final report is adopted. The Safety Board must meet in public on most matters under the Government in the Sunshine Act, and members must provide financial disclosures. Despite safeguards, parties can still influence the NTSB process. The NTSB allows experts to participate in investigations through the \"party process\", but bases conclusions on its own staff's analysis. Board members and senior investigative staff must provide financial disclosures and are restricted from certain financial interests in transportation-related companies. Despite safeguards, the potential for outside parties to influence the NTSB process still exists, which could impact the agency's credibility. The NTSB process allows experts to participate in investigations through the \"party process\", but the agency's credibility could be impacted by outside influences. Balancing unique data from involved parties with impartiality is a challenge, especially in complex investigations, which can prolong the process. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality during complex accident investigations, which can be prolonged by evaluating competing perspectives. The agency follows international standards for aviation accident investigations and may assist in foreign investigations. The NTSB follows international standards for aviation accident investigations and may assist in foreign investigations, even if the US has no vested interest. They may be reimbursed for associated costs. The NTSB may lend expertise to foreign investigations upon request, even without a vested interest. Reimbursements for associated costs can come from outside entities like foreign governments, as per P.L. 109-443. The NTSB can be reimbursed for costs from foreign governments or outside entities. P.L. 109-443 allows for such receipts to be used as offsetting collections. Prior to this, only certain reimbursements were credited as offsetting collections. Additionally, the NTSB has recovered costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through the Safe Skies for Africa program. Between FY2012 and FY2015, the NTSB recovered costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through the Safe Skies for Africa program, ranging from just under $1 million to almost $2.4 million annually. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to effect change in transportation safety regulations and practices. The NTSB's costs for foreign aviation accident investigations ranged from $1 million to $2.4 million annually, with $40,000 to $150,000 covered by the Safe Skies for Africa program. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to regulators, operators, and users of transportation systems to improve safety. Since 1967, over 14,300 safety recommendations have been issued to more than 2,300 recipients across all modes of transportation. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation system safety. Over 14,300 recommendations have been issued since 1967 to various recipients. About 82% of these recommendations have led to safety improvements. Recipients must respond within 90 days detailing how they will implement the recommendations. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation system safety, with over 14,300 recommendations issued since 1967. Recipients must respond within 90 days detailing how they will implement the recommendations, with about 82% leading to safety improvements. Agencies are not required to adopt NTSB recommendations, but the NTSB advocates for their implementation to build public support. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation system safety. Recipients are not required to adopt the recommendations, but the NTSB advocates for their implementation to build public support. Implementation of recommendations may be prolonged due to various factors. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation system safety, advocating for their implementation to build public support. Implementation may be delayed due to rulemaking processes, feasibility concerns, and costs. The NTSB does not consider benefit/cost in its recommendations and highlights key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list. Currently, the list focuses on reducing fatigue-related accidents and improving rail transit safety. The NTSB does not consider cost when issuing safety recommendations and highlights key improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list. The current focus is on reducing fatigue-related accidents and improving rail transit safety oversight. The NTSB's \"Most Wanted\" list includes safety improvements such as promoting collision avoidance technologies, strengthening occupant protection, minimizing operator distractions, preventing loss of control in flight, and ending substance impairment in transportation. These recommendations require action from DOT and states, often involving statutory and regulatory changes. The NTSB's \"Most Wanted\" list includes rail safety initiatives like positive train control and improved tank car design, ending substance impairment in transportation, and requiring operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations influence regulatory agendas and congressional decision-making, often leading to legislative changes. The NTSB's safety recommendations and advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies and congressional decision-making, leading to legislative changes such as positive train control systems, airline pilot fatigue regulations, distracted driving laws, helicopter air ambulance safety standards, and pipeline safety improvements. This influence is evident in the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 includes provisions based on NTSB investigations and recommendations, such as implementing an airline pilot records database and modifying pilot training to enhance monitoring of automated systems. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-190) incorporates NTSB recommendations, including the implementation of an airline pilot records database and modifying pilot training to improve monitoring of automated systems and flying skills. The NTSB raised concerns about pilots' understanding of automated systems and erosion of flying skills after the Asiana Airlines crash in 2013. The FAA is directed to assess mental health screening recommendations for pilots. International focus on pilot mental health increased after the Germanwings crash in 2015. The FAA is directed to assess mental health screening recommendations for pilots following international focus on pilot mental health after the Germanwings crash in 2015. Section 2105 mandates FAA to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. The NTSB raised concerns about crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems following previous aviation accidents. Section 2105 mandates the FAA to update standards for these systems, including older helicopter designs. This aligns with a 2015 NTSB safety recommendation and the Pipeline Safety Act of 2011. The FAA is required to address a 2015 NTSB safety recommendation for crash-resistant fuel systems in newly manufactured helicopters, including older designs. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 also included provisions to enhance pipeline safety. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-90) included provisions to increase federal pipeline safety inspectors, require automatic shutoff valves, verify maximum operating pressure, increase penalties for violations, and review diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-432) mandates positive train control on railroads. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to increase federal pipeline safety inspectors, require automatic shutoff valves, verify maximum operating pressure, increase penalties for violations, and review diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 for railroads carrying passengers or high-volume freight with hazardous materials. It aims to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, such as excessive speed, conflicting train movements, and failure to obey signals. The NTSB also emphasizes minimizing operator distractions to improve transportation safety. The NTSB emphasizes minimizing operator distractions to improve transportation safety. Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012 to encourage states to prohibit texting and cell-phone use for drivers under age 18. States had to have these as primary violations with no exceptions for use while stopped in traffic to qualify for a grant. In 2012, Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program to encourage states to prohibit texting and cell-phone use for drivers under age 18. States had to have these as primary violations with no exceptions for use while stopped in traffic to qualify for a grant. Only one state qualified for a grant under this program in FY2014 and FY2015. In December 2015, a provision in the FAST Act deleted the requirement for an increased fine for repeat offenders. The distracted driving incentive grant program encouraged states to prohibit texting and cell-phone use for drivers under age 18 as primary violations. Only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015. A provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for an increased fine for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. The status of agency actions on transportation safety mandates may be of interest during NTSB reauthorization proceedings. The NTSB funding includes a base authorization, emergency fund, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations like TWA flight 800. Agency actions on transportation safety mandates are important during NTSB reauthorization proceedings. Funding for the NTSB includes a base authorization, emergency fund, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations like TWA flight 800. The existing statute maintains $2 million in the emergency fund, with authorization for up to $4 million. The NTSB has not needed to use the emergency fund or seek supplemental funding. In 1996, a midair explosion off the coast of Long Island, NY resulted in 230 fatalities. The existing statute authorizes up to $4 million in the NTSB's emergency fund, but it has not been used in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is responsible for evaluating the NTSB's operations and activities. Funding levels for the NTSB since FY2007 and the FY2017 funding request are provided in Table 1. The NTSB has not used its emergency fund or sought supplemental appropriations in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities. Appropriations levels since FY2007 and the FY2017 funding request are provided. GAO has made specific recommendations to NTSB in the past. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and fully implemented recommendations from 2006 to 2008. In 2012, GAO confirmed all recommendations were effectively implemented. In 2013, GAO noted improvements but highlighted the need for further enhancements in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, and interagency communications. In 2013, GAO revisited NTSB management and operational practices, finding improvements but recommending further enhancements in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity management. Specifically, GAO suggested developing a strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. The GAO recommended that senior leaders at the NTSB develop a specific strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, and safety issues related to vehicle recorders and data privacy in transportation investigations. The NTSB is facing challenges with staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, and safety issues related to vehicle recorders and data privacy in transportation investigations. Legislation in Congress is addressing NTSB funding and resources for railroad accident investigations. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in FY2008 to carry out its mission effectively, but only received a 12% increase in staffing over the past decade. Additionally, the NTSB has a five-year strategic human capital plan to address mission-critical gaps. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in FY2008 to carry out its mission effectively. Despite a 12% increase in staffing over the past decade, limited resources have led to extended accident investigations and a failure to investigate some pipeline and railroad accidents. The NTSB's plan aims to address gaps in critical competencies, ensure leadership succession, and enhance workforce diversity. Limited resources have caused delays in accident investigations and prevented the investigation of some pipeline and railroad accidents, including fatal grade crossing and trespasser incidents. Congress may question the necessity of the NTSB investigating all fatal railroad accidents given the high number of annual fatalities. The NTSB is mandated to investigate a large number of railroad accidents, including fatal grade crossing and trespasser incidents. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to meet this requirement and consider options to recruit and retain field investigators and specialists in critical fields. The NTSB has concerns about potential staffing shortages and skill gaps in critical fields for accident investigation, particularly in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous. Congress may need to consider additional staffing to meet requirements and enhance recruitment and retention efforts. The NTSB faces staffing challenges in critical areas like the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000 authorized agreements for training with George Washington University. The NTSB awarded a 20-year contract to George Washington University for a training site in 2000. The NTSB Training Center was completed in August 2003 on the Loudon County Campus in Ashburn, VA. Concerns about the facility's costs and benefits have persisted, leading to a requirement in P.L. 109-443 for the NTSB to achieve financial self-sufficiency for the training center. The NTSB Training Center, located on the Loudon County Campus of GWU in Ashburn, VA, was completed in August 2003. Despite efforts to achieve financial self-sufficiency, the center operates at a deficit. Its main purpose is to train NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel for accident investigation and disaster response. The NTSB Training Center, located in Ashburn, VA, aims to train NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel for accident investigation and disaster response. However, it consistently operates at a deficit due to insufficient revenues from training fees and transportation safety-related meetings. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA trains staff and industry personnel for accident investigation and disaster response. Despite hosting forums and meetings on transportation safety, the center struggles to cover costs with training fees. The NTSB relies on leases and rentals to offset expenses, but a 2006 GAO study suggests it may have difficulty fully recovering training center costs. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA struggles to cover costs with training fees despite hosting forums on transportation safety. A 2006 GAO study suggested difficulty in fully recovering training center costs due to leasing issues and violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA faces challenges in covering costs despite hosting transportation safety forums. A 2006 GAO report highlighted leasing issues and Anti-Deficiency Act violations, suggesting possible remedies such as renegotiating the lease or vacating the space to be cost-effective. The GAO identified possible remedies for the NTSB Training Center's cost challenges, including obtaining a deficiency appropriation, renegotiating the lease, terminating the lease, or vacating the space. GAO suggested vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy, but the potential benefits of the facility were not fully considered. Congressional oversight and possible legislation are needed to address the management practices of the NTSB Academy. The GAO suggested vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy for the NTSB Training Center, but the potential benefits were not fully considered. Congressional oversight and possible legislation are needed to address management practices at the NTSB Academy. In a July 2013 review, the NTSB improved utilization of the training center, with classroom usage increasing from less than 20% before FY2007 to over 60% since FY2009. Additionally, the NTSB has leased some unutilized nonclassroom space, resulting in improved cost recovery. In a July 2013 review, the NTSB Training Center improved classroom utilization from less than 20% before FY2007 to over 60% since FY2009. The center also leased unutilized nonclassroom space, leading to better cost recovery. Operating deficit decreased from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015, but the facility still doesn't cover all operating costs. Congressional oversight may focus on utilization and costs during hearings. The NTSB Training Center has seen improved cost recovery, with the annual operating deficit decreasing from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, the facility still does not recoup all operating costs. Data and voice recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, with two main issues surrounding data recorders. The ability of Congress to make changes before the NTSB's lease expires may be limited. Data and voice recorders are important investigative tools in aviation. Two main issues exist with data recorders: recovery after accidents and privacy concerns. Recovery of recorders has been challenging after recent accidents like Air France flight 447. The challenges of promptly recovering accident recorders, especially from submerged aircraft and ships, have been highlighted. Privacy concerns regarding public disclosures and non-accident related uses of recorder data have also been raised. Recent accidents, such as Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804, have faced difficulties in recovering and extracting data from the recorders. Flight 447 crashed off the coast of Brazil in June 2009, sinking to a depth of about 13,000 feet, where the recorders remained until they were recovered and their data downloaded in May 2011. EgyptAir flight 804 crashed in the Mediterranean Sea on May 19, 2016, but its recorders were not recovered until June 16, 2016, and then required extensive repair before data could be extracted. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing after disappearing during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China, on March 8, 2014, with the recorders still not found or recovered. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing after disappearing during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations urging aircraft to transmit data on impact location and carry recorders allowing for the recovery of flight data parameters without underwater retrieval. The NTSB recommended transmitting data on impact location and carrying recorders for easy recovery of flight data parameters. They urged harmonization of technologies and regulations with foreign aviation authorities and proposed protections against disabling flight recorder devices. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require certain large passenger aircraft to be equipped with necessary technologies. The NTSB recommended transmitting data on impact location and carrying recorders for easy recovery of flight data parameters. They urged protections against disabling flight recorder devices. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 (H.R. 753) would require certain large passenger aircraft to be equipped with continuous tracking information technology and automatic deployable flight recorders. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 (H.R. 753) proposes equipping large passenger aircraft with continuous tracking technology and automatic deployable flight recorders to aid in timely recovery of flight data and cockpit voice recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in October 2015 highlighted concerns about locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders, with the El Faro's recorder being retrieved 10 months after the accident at a depth of 15,000 feet. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in October 2015 raised concerns over locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders. The recorder, affixed to the mast, sank to a depth of 15,000 feet and was retrieved 10 months later. Certain passenger and cargo vessels are required to carry voyage data recorders under SOLAS regulations. Under SOLAS regulations, certain vessels must carry voyage data recorders. New regulations require new ships to have both fixed-mount and float-away recorders, capturing additional parameters and data for greater safety. Older ships with existing recorders are not required to upgrade. Revised regulations in 2014 require new ships to have retrievable fixed-mount and float-away voyage data recorders, capturing more parameters and data for longer periods. Concerns over data recovery from vessels lost in deep water may prompt congressional interest in assisting investigators. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding maritime voyage data recorders' recovery or survivability characteristics, but concerns over data recovery may lead to congressional interest in assisting investigators. Event recorders are aiding accident investigations in various transportation modes, raising privacy concerns about the increasing collection of data, voice, and video recordings. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or other authority for investigative purposes. This addresses concerns about privacy and potential misuse of recorded data outside of accident investigations. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to limit access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or other authority for specific purposes like vehicle diagnostics or investigations. The bill aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, with exceptions for specific purposes like vehicle diagnostics, investigations, emergency medical response, and traffic safety research. It also mandates a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a report to Congress. The bill aims to restrict access to event data recorder information in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, with exceptions for specific purposes like vehicle diagnostics, investigations, emergency medical response, and traffic safety research. It also requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct a study, provide a report to Congress, and establish regulations on the duration of data capture for investigating motor vehicle crashes. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all required railroad accidents, prompting increased interest in railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all required railroad accidents, leading to increased interest in railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations. Legislation specifies funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 authorizes appropriations to the NTSB for railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. The bill authorizes appropriations to the NTSB for railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. It also directs DOT to study the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
