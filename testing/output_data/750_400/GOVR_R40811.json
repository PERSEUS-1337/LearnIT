    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to high accumulations of biomass. Congress is being urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and lessen wildfire severity. Federal agencies already have broad but indirect authorities to address biomass fuel reduction for wildfire protection. Biomass fuels can be reduced through prescribed burning and thinning to prevent wildfires. Federal agencies have broad but indirect authorities for fuel reduction efforts, funded through annual appropriations. However, reporting on these activities is insufficient for Congress to assess progress in reducing biomass. The funding and reporting on hazardous fuel treatment and other wildfire protection activities are inadequate for Congress to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels. The funding and reporting on wildfire protection activities are insufficient for Congress to evaluate progress in reducing biomass fuels. Improved reporting on funding and results, with data disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, may enhance understanding of appropriations. Improved reporting on funding and accomplishments related to prescribed burning, thinning, and fuel reduction efforts in different ecosystems or fire regimes could enhance Congress's understanding of appropriations for wildfire protection. All biomass can fuel wildfires, which are inevitable in temperate ecosystems due to dry conditions and various ignition sources. Wildfires in temperate ecosystems are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignition sources. All biomass can fuel wildfires, with some fires being low-intensity surface fires and others becoming high-intensity crown fires. The type of wildfire depends on specific conditions. Wildfires can vary in intensity, from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires that burn through the forest canopy. The type of wildfire depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. Four characteristics of biomass fuels significantly affect wildfire behavior. The behavior of wildfires, whether they are low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires, depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts aim to modify fuel properties to reduce damages caused by crown fires. Four key characteristics of biomass fuels impact wildfire behavior: moisture content, size, distribution, and total quantity. Moisture content is particularly crucial as it affects the flammability of the fuel by requiring heat for evaporation. The moisture content of fuels significantly affects wildfire behavior and fire effects. It is the most important property controlling flammability, as biomass requires heat to evaporate moisture before burning. Green foliage's moisture content varies based on weather, while dead biomass contains water at lower levels. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited easily. The moisture content of green foliage and dead biomass affects wildfire behavior. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be easily ignited, while 100% moisture content can burn with high winds. Wildfire fuels are described by the time it takes for moisture content to decline by two-thirds. Wildfire fuels are categorized based on the time it takes for their moisture content to decrease by two-thirds. Fine fuels like needles and grass dry out in about an hour, while woody twigs and branches up to a quarter-inch in diameter dry out in 10 hours. The smallest diameter fuels, known as fine fuels or flash fuels, dry out in about an hour and are important for spreading fires quickly. They include needles, leaves, grass, and twigs up to a quarter-inch in diameter. Larger size classes include fuels that take longer to dry out. The larger size classes of fuels are categorized as 100-hour time lag fuels (up to 3 inches in diameter) and 1,000-hour time lag fuels (more than 3 inches in diameter). Fine fuels ignite and burn quickly, while 1-hour time lag fuels contribute little to fire intensity due to their small mass and quick burn time. 10-hour time lag fuels also contribute to the rate of spread as they ignite quickly and can be carried by winds as firebrands. Fine fuels burn quickly and contribute to fire intensity and damage. 10-hour time lag fuels also spread quickly as firebrands can be carried by winds. Larger fuels like 1,000-hour time lag fuels burn intensely but do not contribute much to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in fire behavior. Compact fuel beds are more resistant to burning due to reduced compaction. Larger fuels, such as 1,000-hour time lag fuels, burn intensely but contribute little to the rate of spread. Firebrands can be carried by winds, starting spot fires ahead of the main fire. Fuel distribution is crucial in fire behavior. Compact fuel beds resist burning due to reduced compaction, which slows moisture loss and restricts air flow to the fire. Less compaction allows more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire until the fuel breaks continuity. Fuel distribution is crucial in fire behavior as compact fuel beds resist burning by reducing compaction, which slows moisture loss and restricts air flow to the fire. Less compaction allows more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire until the fuel breaks continuity, which is essential for wildfires to spread. The continuity of fuels is crucial for fire spread, with firelines breaking the continuity to control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed affect the width of the break needed. Steep slopes and high winds can reduce fuel moisture, raise temperatures, and make the fuel more flammable. High winds can also carry firebrands, spreading the fire across wide firebreaks. Factors such as slope and wind speed play a significant role in the ease of igniting fuels across fire breaks. Steep slopes and high winds can bring the fire closer to the fuel, reducing moisture content and increasing flammability. Additionally, continuous fuel ladders, especially fine fuels, can spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Continuous fuel ladders, particularly fine fuels, can spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Wind is crucial for sustaining a crown fire by reducing moisture content and increasing flammability. When burning, pre-heating green foliage reduces fuel moisture and raises temperatures, necessary for initiating and sustaining a crown fire. Wind is crucial for crown fires, as green foliage has higher moisture content than surface biomass. Once started, a crown fire can intensify and spread with strong convection. Fuel loads vary widely, excluding live trees but including dead biomass and undergrowth. The quantity of biomass fuels, known as fuel loads, can vary widely and include dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, depending on the type of vegetation present. The total mass, density, and continuity of live crown biomass are significant factors in sustaining crown fires, despite the exclusion of live crown biomass in commercially valuable trees. Fuel loads can vary from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, with fuel not always being completely consumed. The live crown biomass plays a crucial role in sustaining crown fires, even though it is excluded in commercially valuable trees. Not all fuel is consumed in wildfires, with smaller fuels being mostly consumed compared to larger fuels. High-intensity fires can consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only 10% of tree branches and 5% of large tree stems, leaving many large-diameter fuels remaining. The nature of fuel consumption in wildfires varies based on fuel size, with smaller fuels being mostly consumed compared to larger fuels. High-intensity fires can consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only 10% of tree branches and 5% of large tree stems, leaving many large-diameter fuels remaining on the site. The characteristics of fuels and resulting fires are influenced by the ecosystems they are in, with some adapted to low-intensity surface fires and others to high-intensity crown fires. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to frequent wildfires, with some experiencing low-intensity surface fires, while others are prone to high-intensity crown fires. The nature of fuel characteristics and resulting fires is influenced by the ecosystems they are in, with some adapted to periodic crown fires and others to mixed regimes. Large-diameter fuels often remain on the site after a fire, with some ecosystems evolving with little to no natural wildfire. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to frequent wildfires, with some experiencing low-intensity surface fires, while others are prone to high-intensity crown fires. Some ecosystems are adapted to mixed regimes of crown and surface fires, while others have evolved with little to no natural wildfire. These ecosystems are characterized by large amounts of fine fuels and fire-resistant trees, such as ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine. Surface-fire ecosystems, like grasslands and meadows, are dominated by fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine. These ecosystems have few small to mid-sized trees, resulting in infrequent crown fires. They make up about 34% of all U.S. wildlands. Surface-fire ecosystems, such as grasslands and meadows, are mainly composed of fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine. These ecosystems have few small to mid-sized trees, leading to rare crown fires. They account for approximately 34% of all U.S. wildlands. Grazing and logging activities in the late 1800s reduced grass cover, affecting the fine fuels that carried frequent surface fires and allowing fuel loads of branches and small to mid-size trees to increase. In the late 1800s, heavy grazing and logging activities in the West reduced grass cover in surface-fire ecosystems, leading to an increase in fuel loads of branches and small to mid-size trees. Effective fire suppression further contributed to higher fuel loads, creating ecosystems with much higher fuel loads than historically natural. In the West, heavy grazing and logging activities in the late 1800s reduced grass cover in surface-fire ecosystems, leading to an increase in fuel loads of branches and small to mid-size trees. Effective fire suppression further contributed to higher fuel loads, creating ecosystems with much higher fuel loads than historically natural. This has put many frequent surface fire ecosystems at risk of catastrophic crown fires, potentially altering these ecosystems significantly. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems.

This has put many frequent surface fire ecosystems at risk of catastrophic crown fires, potentially altering these ecosystems significantly. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. Ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires are characterized by large amounts of dense, relatively uniform fuels\u2014plants of the same size and age that regenerated following the previous crown fire. Occasionally, the fires are relatively frequent\u2014less than 50 years between fires\u2014and many. Ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires are characterized by dense, uniform fuels with relatively frequent fires. Chaparral is a classic example of such an ecosystem, dominated by large shrubs and small trees. Crown fires are infrequent, with 200 years or more between fires. Most trees are killed, but new stands establish in burned areas. Lodgepole pine is a classic example, with serotinous cones that release seeds after being heated by fire. Crown-fire ecosystems cover about 42% of wildlands in the United States. Crown fires are infrequent, occurring every 200 years or more. Lodgepole pine is a classic example of a species that regenerates in burned areas. These ecosystems cover about 42% of wildlands in the United States and contain large volumes of biomass fuels. Human activities like grazing, logging, and fire suppression have not significantly impacted fuel loads or the nature of fires in these ecosystems. Approximately 42% of wildlands in the United States contain ecosystems with large biomass fuel volumes. Human activities like grazing, logging, and fire suppression have not had a significant impact on fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatments and removing fuel ladders are not effective in preventing catastrophic crown fires, as seen in southern California chaparral. There is no evidence that reducing fuel loads and removing fuel ladders would prevent catastrophic crown fires in ecosystems like southern California chaparral. Even in crown-fire ecosystems, wildfires are patchy and leave some areas lightly burned or unburned. The manipulation of fuels can prevent large fires, as catastrophic crown fires do not completely destroy all vegetation. Wildfires respond to minor variations in moisture and fuel, typically burning patchily. For example, the Yellowstone fires in 1988 left 30% of the reported burned area unburned and 15%-20% with low-intensity surface fires. Only about half of the reported acres burned severely. The Yellowstone fires in 1988, largely in lodgepole pine, were extensively reported. However, only about half of the reported burned acres were severely burned, with 30% unburned and 15%-20% experiencing low-intensity surface fires. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires mixed with low-intensity surface fires, featuring an array of fuel sizes and discontinuous crown canopies. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires mixed with low-intensity surface fires, featuring an array of fuel sizes and discontinuous crown canopies. Whitebark pine, a slow-growing species limited to high elevation sites, moderates micro-climatic conditions to allow true firs and spruces to grow. Mixed-intensity fires in these ecosystems kill competing firs and spruces. Whitebark pine, a slow-growing species found at high elevations, helps moderate micro-climatic conditions to allow true firs and spruces to grow. Mixed-intensity fires in these ecosystems kill competing trees, but some whitebark pines survive and are regenerated by Clark's nutcrackers spreading seeds in burned areas. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems can have a variety of tree species surviving and regenerating after fires, with Clark's nutcrackers playing a key role in spreading seeds for whitebark pines. Other species like ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine can also adapt to mixed-fire types under specific conditions. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems can have various tree species surviving after fires, with ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine adapting to specific conditions. These ecosystems account for about 24% of U.S. wildlands, but the consequences of fuel reduction activities in these areas are not well understood. Pine can be a mixed fire type on dry sites like the eastern Sierras. Less is known about fuel reduction consequences in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, including abnormal crown fires. It is uncertain if fuel reduction would significantly alter wildfire severity in these ecosystems. Reducing fuel loads may not significantly alter wildfire severity in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, and it may not benefit protecting structures and communities from wildfires. Reducing fuel loads may not significantly alter wildfire severity in some ecosystems and may not benefit protecting structures and communities from wildfires. Evidence from the Hayman Fire in 2002 shows the potential futility of reducing the risk of crown fires for protecting infrastructure in the wildland-urban interface. The Hayman Fire in 2002 demonstrated the limited effectiveness of reducing crown fires to protect infrastructure in the wildland-urban interface. 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived relatively unscathed, with 53% destroyed by torching or crown fire and 47% by surface fire or firebrands. Reducing fuel loads may help decrease the extent of wildfires in surface-fire ecosystems. However, many suggest the need to increase the area burned in low-intensity surface fires to maintain natural conditions and values. Reducing fuel loads in surface-fire ecosystems may help decrease wildfire extent. Increasing the area burned in low-intensity fires is also suggested to maintain natural conditions. Activities like prescribed fires are proposed to modify fuel characteristics for safer wildfire management. Reducing fuel loads and modifying fuel characteristics through activities like prescribed burning and thinning are necessary for the safe use of low-intensity wildfires in surface-fire ecosystems. However, caution is advised as these activities may not always reduce the risk of crown fires. Thinning and prescribed fires can alter microclimates, increasing surface temperatures and fire intensity, potentially raising the risk of crown fires. Thinning stands allows solar radiation to reach the forest floor, increasing surface temperatures and fire intensity. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas under prescribed fuel and weather conditions. It is not always fully controlled, as conditions can change and fires may escape control, causing extensive damage. Prescribed fires can escape control and cause extensive damage if conditions change. Some observers consider naturally occurring fires within acceptable areas and conditions as prescribed burning. Wildland fire use is used for such fires, not included as prescribed fires but counted as acres treated for fuel reduction. Prescribed burning primarily eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes, which feed new plant growth. Prescribed burning eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes, which feed new plant growth. However, it has limitations as it has little effect on large diameter fuels and is not effective in reducing tree density or crown density. Prescribed burning is also risky and can lead to escaped fires. Prescribed burning has limitations as it does not effectively reduce tree density or crown density. It is also risky, with escaped fires leading to notable wildfires. Fire managers tend to err on the side of caution, resulting in high implementation costs and significant health hazards from smoke. Prescribed burning is risky, with escaped fires leading to notable wildfires, causing high implementation costs and health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies like the Forest Service and BLM are involved in managing these risks. The federal land management agencies have policies in place to allow fire managers to use naturally-occurring fires for fire management objectives, known as wildland fire use. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn\" or prescribed natural fire, allows wildfires to burn with monitoring instead of aggressive suppression efforts. This practice is similar to prescribed burning and is considered a fuel reduction treatment, with the main difference being the source of ignition. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. The method alters biomass fuels depending on the approach used. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. The method alters biomass fuels depending on the approach used, such as low thinning, crown thinning, or thinning from below. Thinning methods include low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning, each targeting different trees to reduce biomass fuels. Thinning is preferred over prescribed burning for fuel reduction due to its controlled nature and ability to select which trees to cut. Thinning methods include low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning for reducing fuels, as it is controlled and can target specific trees for removal. Thinning can also reduce crown density and eliminate ladder fuels more effectively than prescribed fire. Thinning, including low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning, offers advantages over prescribed burning for reducing fuels. It can target specific trees for removal, reduce crown density, and eliminate ladder fuels effectively. Thinning can create a targeted stand structure and reduce vertical fuel continuity to prevent crown fires. Thinning is effective in reducing fuel continuity to prevent crown fires, but leaves slash on the ground which increases short-term fuel load. Mechanical treatments are needed to reduce the slash and contribute to fuel reduction. Thinning has disadvantages compared to prescribed burning as it leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load. Mechanical treatments are needed to reduce the slash and contribute to fuel reduction, but they are labor-intensive and costly operations. Thinning is not always intended to reduce biomass fuels, as it can also be used to increase biomass growth of desired commercial trees. Thinning in forests can involve various treatments like lop-and-scatter, pile-and-burn, or chipping, which are labor-intensive and costly. Thinning is not always done to reduce biomass fuels but can also aim to increase growth of desired commercial trees. However, leaving slash on the ground after thinning can increase fire hazards in the short term. Thinning may not provide effective wildfire protection in crown-fire ecosystems but can be beneficial in surface-fire and mixed-fire regime ecosystems. Thinning in forests aims to concentrate biomass growth on fewer stems for larger, more valuable trees. However, leaving slash on the ground post-thinning can increase fire hazards in the short term. Thinning may not effectively protect against wildfires in crown-fire ecosystems but can help reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in surface-fire and mixed-fire regime ecosystems. Combining thinning with prescribed burning is a common proposal to eliminate ladder fuels and reduce crown density, followed by burning to remove fine and small fuels in thinning slash. Thinning in forests aims to concentrate biomass growth on fewer stems for larger, more valuable trees. Combining thinning with prescribed burning is a common proposal to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires. However, the effectiveness of such combined operations is limited and costly. Combining thinning with prescribed burning or logging is suggested to reduce fuel loads in forests. However, the effectiveness of these combined operations is limited and costly, with variable results shown in empirical evidence. Commercial logging focuses on removing large standing trees to reduce crown density. Logging, particularly salvage logging of stands with dead trees, is sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads in forests. However, commercial logging mainly targets large standing trees, which may not effectively address fuel ladders and leaves behind substantial slash. The idea that commercial logging can decrease canopy fires has not been scientifically tested. Commercial logging, especially salvage logging of dead tree stands, may not effectively reduce fuel ladders or address crown base height. The proposal that logging can decrease canopy fires remains untested in scientific literature. Salvage of standing dead trees could reduce fuels, but some argue that they may contribute less to crown fire intensity and spread compared to live trees. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees without needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density, but leaves slash on the ground that can increase fire intensity and spread. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density, but leaves slash on the ground can increase fire intensity and spread. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection of federal lands: Forest Service (FS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have been implicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels for wildfire protection on their lands. None of the agencies are explicitly directed to do so, but it falls within their mandate to preserve and protect the lands under their jurisdiction.

The Forest Service has funding programs for activities like prescribed burning to reduce biomass fuels, including the Hazardous Fuels sub-account. The Forest Service has specific funding programs for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account is the primary source of funds for prescribed burning, but can also be used for other fuel reduction activities. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account in the Wildland Fire Management line item is the main funding source for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities. Funding increased significantly in FY2001, continued to rise through FY2008, spiked in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation, and has since declined. Specific details on how much funding is used for prescribed burning or other activities, and the ecosystems where these activities occur, are not reported. Funding for Hazardous Fuels rose substantially from FY2001 to FY2009, with a spike in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation. However, funding has since declined. Thinning activities, including fuel reduction and timber production, are funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System line item. This account also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, and watershed protection. Funding for thinning activities, including fuel reduction and timber production, has declined over the last few years. Thinning is funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System, which also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management efforts. In FY2008, about 20% of appropriations to this account funded thinning and related activities. In FY2008, approximately 20% of funding in the Vegetation and Watershed Management account was allocated to thinning and related activities, such as pruning. The portion used for thinning varies annually, and the specific amount dedicated to improving wildfire protection is unknown.

The FWS and BIA have accounts that could fund fuel reduction activities, but the specific allocation for these activities is unknown. The BLM also has a mandatory spending account that can be used for such activities. The BIA and BLM have accounts that can fund activities to reduce wildfire threats on Indian lands. The specific allocation for fuel reduction activities is unknown, but the Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund can be used by BLM for various activities to improve wildfire protection. The Forest Service has a fund called the Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund that can be used for activities to reduce biomass fuels and improve wildfire protection. Federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are limited, with the FS having two wildfire protection assistance programs that include fuel reduction. Other agencies do not have financial and technical assistance programs for state or local fuel reduction efforts. The Forest Service has limited federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands. They have two wildfire protection assistance programs that can include fuel reduction. Other agencies do not offer financial and technical assistance programs for state or local governments or private landowners for biomass fuel reduction activities. One FS wildfire protection assistance program is State Fire Assistance, providing funding for technical and financial assistance to states for fire prevention, fire control, and prescribed burning for fire protection. The Forest Service offers two wildfire protection assistance programs for state or local governments and private landowners for biomass fuel reduction activities. Funding is provided for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning. Allocation to states is based on a non-statutory formula, and the portion used for fuel reduction is at each state's discretion. The Forest Service offers two wildfire protection assistance programs for state or local governments and private landowners for biomass fuel reduction activities. The first program is based on a non-statutory formula for allocation to states, with each state deciding on the portion used for fuel reduction through prescribed burning. The second program, Volunteer Fire Assistance, provides technical and financial aid to rural volunteer fire departments for fire prevention and control. Eligibility is limited to organizations serving communities of up to 10,000 people with firefighting personnel that are 80% or more volunteer.

The Volunteer Fire Assistance program, which supports rural volunteer fire departments, is recognized as a fire department by state laws. Funding allocation is at the agency's discretion, with support for Community Wildfire Protection authorized. The program, established in the 2002 farm bill, aims to expand homeowner protection and establish defensible space around private homes. No funds have been appropriated for this program to date. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) aims to expand homeowner and community outreach for wildfire protection, including establishing defensible space around private homes. The Forest Service can reduce biomass fuels on private lands with landowner consent, although no funds have been allocated for this program yet. State Fire Assistance funding could potentially be used for implementation. Other FS programs offer technical and financial assistance for forest stewardship and health protection. The Forest Service has programs for reducing fuels on nonfederal lands, including financial and technical assistance for forest stewardship, health protection, and emergency restoration. It is unclear how much funding from these programs could contribute to wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction."
