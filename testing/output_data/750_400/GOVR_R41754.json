The amendment proposed by Senator Coburn in the Minibus bill would restrict the use of grants to repay federal loans, affecting programs like the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee program. This has implications for using CDBG funds as collateral to secure and repay Section 108 loan guarantees in case of default. States and communities have used CDBG funds to cover revenue shortfalls associated with the repayment of bonds for Section 108 supported projects to avoid default. The House requested a conference on H.R. 2112 on November 3, 2011, to reconcile differences. The House and Senate approved the conference version of H.R. 2112 on November 17, 2011, which was signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, appropriating $3.308 billion for CDF.

The CDF, including the Community Development Block Grant program, faced significant budget reductions in earlier legislative efforts. Funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, was initially targeted for reduction by 62.5% in a previous appropriations bill. In an earlier version of a consolidated appropriations bill, H.R. 1 passed by the House, funding for CDBG activities was targeted for a 62.5% reduction below the FY2010 level. This was part of efforts to cut federal budget deficit. The House-passed H.R. 1 aimed to reduce total funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion below the Obama Administration's request. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion to cut the federal budget deficit. The bill included cuts to the CDF account, which houses the CDBG program. However, the bill did not receive Senate approval, leading to renewed negotiations. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to cut funding for discretionary programs, including the CDF account with the CDBG program. Despite failing to win Senate approval, negotiations between the Obama Administration and Congress led to the signing of P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 on April 15, 2011. After negotiations, President Obama signed P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, on April 15, 2011, allocating $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account. P.L. 112-10 was passed by both the House and the Senate to avoid a government shutdown. It allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. Additionally, there was a 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative.

Table 3 displays the adjusted appropriations for CDF activities, including the actual distribution of funds for FY2010, the Administration's budget request for FY2011, and the projected distribution based on legislative language. The CDF account received a reduced appropriation of $3.501 billion for FY2010, which is 21.3% less than the previous year and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. Included in the CDF account is the CDBG program. The FY2011 appropriation of $3.501 billion for the CDF account is 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. It is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, with formula-based grants for various entities. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4%. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, formula-based grants for various entities, and funds for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI).

The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 levels and prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program components were not included, leading to uncertainty in fund distribution among states, entitlement communities, insular areas, Indian tribes, and other programs. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 levels and prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1 for Senate consideration, which included a provision for allocating funds among CDBG components based on FY2010 percentages. Senator Inouye submitted S.Amdt. 149, an amendment to H.R. 1, which proposed allocating $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion designated for the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level of $3.943 billion, with additional funds for insular areas and Indian tribes. The amendment proposed allocating $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. It aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level of $3.943 billion, with additional funds for insular areas and Indian tribes.

The CDBG allocations for FY2012 totaled $2.942 billion, a 10.7% decrease from FY2011. This led to a 29.1% reduction in the average grant amount awarded to entitlement communities. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. This decrease is due to lower appropriations and an increase in the number of qualifying communities. State allocations also decreased by 25.4% during the same period. Despite these reductions, CDBG funding cuts were less severe than initially proposed in H.R. The average state allocation for CDBG funding declined by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012, impacting local community and economic development activities. The proposed 62.5% reduction in funding in H.R. 1 would have had a significant long-term impact on state and local government plans. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted state and local governments' community and economic development plans, forcing them to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation, public facilities, and services. Non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees would also have seen their resources undercut. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have affected state and local governments' community and economic development plans, leading to the postponement or termination of activities supporting job creation, public facilities, and services. Non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees would also have seen their resources reduced, impacting a range of CDBG-funded public services and activities. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program disproportionately affects low and moderate income households, with the FY2012 appropriations being the lowest in over a decade. This will lead to entitlement communities delaying projects and reducing support for public services and facilities. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade, leading to entitlement communities delaying projects and reducing support for public services and facilities. This reduction in funding will impact low and moderate income households, with some activities being delayed or reduced. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade, leading to entitlement communities delaying projects and reducing support for public services and facilities. This reduction in funding will impact low and moderate income households, with some activities being delayed or reduced, including those undertaken by community-based organizations acting as sub-grantees. Table 5 shows the actual distribution of CDBG formula funds awarded to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. Each state total includes amounts allocated to the state and entitlement communities within it, with the number of entitlement communities in each state identified in the table. Calculations for the three fiscal years were generated by HUD. P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, also contributed to reducing support for various activities. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 reduced formula allocations to states and entitlement communities by 16.4% below FY2010 allocations, while the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2012 decreased CDBG formula allocations by 25.1% below the amounts allocated for FY2011. Total amounts allocated to states and entitlement communities for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 are shown in Table 5. The Appropriations Act for FY2011 and FY2012 reduced CDBG formula allocations to states and entitlement communities. 70% of the funds are allocated to entitlement communities, with the remaining 30% distributed among states and Puerto Rico. The CDBG funds are allocated with 70% going to entitlement communities and 30% to states and Puerto Rico. Formula A is used to distribute funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties. CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities and states using Formula A, based on population and poverty factors. Formula A, created with the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, allocates funds based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors for metropolitan cities and urban counties. Formula B, enacted with the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1977, also allocates funds. The second formula, Formula B, allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population growth lag factor, poverty levels, and overcrowded housing conditions. The distribution of CDBG funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties is governed by weighted factors including population growth lag, poverty levels, and housing built before 1940. Additionally, funds to states are allocated based on population share. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system, with Formula A using population, poverty, and overcrowded housing in nonentitlement areas, and Formula B using poverty housing built before 1940 and persons living in poverty in all nonentitlement areas. HUD is required to use these formulas for fund allocation each fiscal year. The CDBG program allocates funds to states using two formulas: Formula A considers population, poverty, and overcrowded housing, while Formula B considers poverty housing built before 1940 and persons living in poverty. HUD uses Census Bureau data for allocations starting from FY2012. Starting from FY2012, HUD will use the most recent Census Bureau data and Office of Management and Budget reports to allocate CDBG funds, allowing for more accurate reflection of demographic changes. The data sources will be updated annually, with the 2010 Decennial Census and 2005-2009 American Community Survey five-year estimates being used initially. HUD will now use the most recent Census Bureau data and Office of Management and Budget reports to allocate CDBG funds, updating annually with the 2010 Decennial Census and 2005-2009 American Community Survey five-year estimates. This will ensure more accurate reflection of demographic changes for allocations. The 2000 Decennial Census was used as the data source for poverty, overcrowded housing conditions, and pre-1940 housing stock in FY2011 allocations. HUD released a study in December 2011 on the impacts of using 2010 Census and ACS data for CDBG formula grant funds allocation. The study assumed constant eligible entities and program appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to analyze the effect of new data sources on fund distribution. The HUD study in December 2011 analyzed the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data on CDBG formula grant funds allocation. The study assumed constant eligible entities and program appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to isolate the effect of the new data sources on fund distribution. Selected findings showed that communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions may be most negatively affected by the change in data sources. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions may be negatively impacted by the change in data sources for CDBG allocations. Entitlement communities in these regions saw declines in their funding, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions were positively affected. The change in data sources for CDBG allocations had varying impacts on entitlement communities in different regions. Communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions experienced positive effects with increases in their funding allocations. On the other hand, communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw declines in their funding due to the changes in data sources. The introduction of new data sources also resulted in principal cities of metropolitan areas and urban counties receiving a greater share of funds, while funding allocated to other entitlement cities decreased. The introduction of new data sources for CDBG allocations resulted in varying impacts on different regions. Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions saw increases in funding allocations, while Puerto Rico and Mid-Atlantic regions experienced declines. Principal cities and urban counties received a greater share of funds, while other entitlement cities saw a decrease. New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest decline in funding at 27.4% and 27.3%, respectively. The report shows that cities experienced a 3.1% decline in funding, driven by increasing poverty in urban counties and decreasing overcrowding in satellite cities. New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest funding declines at 27.4% and 27.3% respectively. The report can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf. The report discusses funding declines in cities due to increasing poverty and decreasing overcrowding. New Mexico and Puerto Rico saw the largest declines at 27.4% and 27.3% respectively. The report includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the primary components of the CDF account. The report reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, focusing on CDBG formula grants, set-asides, and special appropriations. Total appropriations fluctuated between $3.772 billion in FY2007 and $5.112 billion in FY2001, excluding disaster and economic recovery funds. FY2011 appropriations for CDF activities are at their lowest. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between $3.772 billion in FY2007 and $5.112 billion in FY2001, excluding special and supplemental appropriations. FY2011 saw the lowest appropriations in over a decade, with a focus on the funding level for the CDBG-formula component sparking debate. Supporters argue for increased funding, citing declines in both current and constant dollars. Appropriations for CDF activities are at their lowest in over a decade, with a focus on the funding level for the CDBG-formula component sparking debate. Supporters advocate for increased funding, pointing out declines in both current and constant dollars, exacerbated by the growing number of entitlement communities sharing a shrinking portion of funds. Critics argue that increased funding for the CDBG program is not justified, citing the program's low PART score and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to address the federal budget deficit and national debt.

From FY2000 to FY2010, the average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from $3 million in FY2002 to $2.1 million in FY2008. Total appropriations decreased annually from FY2001 to FY2008 but have been increasing from FY2009 to FY2010. The average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from $3 million in FY2002 to $2.1 million in FY2008. Total appropriations decreased annually from FY2001 to FY2008 but have been increasing from FY2009 to FY2010. However, since FY2008, the average allocation had increased by 9%, reaching $2.4 million in FY2010. The FY2011 estimated average allocation of $1.9 million is 34.5% less than the amount appropriated in FY2000, indicating a reversal of the recent trend. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities has been fluctuating over the years. It increased by 9% from $2.2 million in FY2008 to $2.4 million in FY2010 but decreased to $1.9 million in FY2011, which is 34.5% less than in FY2000. This decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The average grant amount for CDBG entitlement communities decreased by 34.5% from FY2000 to FY2011 due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The number of jurisdictions receiving direct allocations increased by 155 during this period. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, a decrease of 7.4% from FY2000. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before rebounding to $23.2 million in FY2010. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, a decrease of 7.4% from FY2000. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before rebounding to $23.2 million in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation of $19.1 million reverses that upward trend. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. The FY2011 average state allocation of $19.1 million reverses the upward trend. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants have fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in current dollars over the last decade. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants have fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in current dollars over the last decade. The CDF includes other programs with smaller appropriations, some intended to complement the CDBG formula program, while others meet different agency objectives or are earmarked for specific activities. Critics argue that funding for these smaller programs has come at the expense of the larger CDBG formula grant program. The CDF account includes set-asides for various programs with smaller appropriations, some to complement the CDBG formula grant program and others for specific activities. Funding for these programs has fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with Congress appropriating as much as $647 million in FY2001 and as little as $61 million in FY2007. Earmarks in the CDF account were eliminated by Congress in FY2007. In FY2000 to FY2011, funding for set-aside programs in the CDF account varied significantly. Congress allocated $647 million in FY2001 but only $61 million in FY2007. Earmarks were eliminated in FY2007, and in FY2010, $509 million was allocated, with a focus on Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). However, funding for these earmarked accounts was eliminated in FY2011. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $509 million in CDF set-aside activities, with a significant portion targeted to the earmark accounts of Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). However, for FY2011, Congress eliminated funding for the EDI and NI earmarked accounts, resulting in a broad swing in the amounts appropriated for CDF set-asides due to various decisions made by Congress regarding categorical grant programs. The broad swing in CDF set-aside appropriations from FY2000 to FY2011 was due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs, including funding changes, program transfers, and earmarks for EDI and NI programs. CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks declined by 59.4% in constant FY2000 dollars from FY2000 to FY2008 but rebounded in FY2009. From FY2000 to FY2011, CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks declined by 59.4% in constant FY2000 dollars, rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010, before declining significantly in FY2011. Congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were dominant elements of CDBG-related set-asides. Congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were the main focus of CDBG-related set aside appropriations, except for FY2011 and FY2007 when there were no earmarks, and FY2010 when the Obama Administration introduced the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Earmarks have been a topic of debate in recent Congresses, with rules being implemented by both houses regarding their use. In recent Congresses, congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs have been the main focus of CDBG-related set aside appropriations. Earmarks have been a topic of debate, with rules implemented by both houses regarding their use. Since FY2007, EDI and NI earmarks have been included in subsequent legislation appropriating funds for CDF activities. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the dominant components of CDBG-linked set asides programs. Since FY2007, Congress has included EDI and NI earmarks in legislation appropriating funds for CDF activities. In FY2008 and FY2009, these earmarks were the main focus of CDBG-linked set aside programs, with appropriations for EDI and NI being twice the amount for other set-aside activities combined. However, for FY2011, Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has used the CDBG program's framework for supplemental appropriations when needed. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks received double the funding of other set-aside activities. However, in FY2011, Congress did not allocate funds for NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has utilized the CDBG program's structure for additional appropriations in response to events like 9/11 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes, as well as to aid in reducing abandoned properties due to the mortgage crisis. The funds have been used to support disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities for events like 9/11 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes. They also assist in reducing abandoned properties due to the mortgage crisis and support job creation in response to the economic recession. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was part of the federal effort under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to address the foreclosure crisis and support job creation in response to the economic recession. Funds were allocated to states and selected communities to acquire, rehabilitate, and resell foreclosed properties. Disaster relief and NSP funding were allocated based on specific criteria or eligibility thresholds. Disaster relief and NSP funding were allocated based on specific criteria or eligibility thresholds, with CDBG disaster funding only going to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration. Congress decides if supplemental CDBG funds are needed beyond FEMA's typical assistance. In disaster relief funding, only communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration receive funds at Congress's discretion. Funds for NSP-1 and NSP-3 were allocated to states based on mortgage-related criteria, with a minimum grant amount established by Congress. Funds from NSP-1 and NSP-3 were allocated to states based on mortgage-related criteria, with a minimum grant amount set by Congress. States were required to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments in high foreclosure areas for direct administration. Congress mandated that states allocate NSP-1 and NSP-3 funds to local governments in high foreclosure areas, with minimum thresholds set at $2 million for NSP-1 and $1 million for NSP-3. This resulted in 309 communities qualifying for NSP-1 funds and 268 for NSP-3, while NSP-2 funds were competitively awarded to various entities. The allocation of NSP funds to communities was based on meeting minimum thresholds of $2 million for NSP-1 and $1 million for NSP-3. 309 communities qualified for NSP-1 funds and 268 for NSP-3. NSP-2 funds were competitively awarded to states, local governments, and non-profit organizations. Representative Gary Miller introduced H.R. 861 to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. On March 2, 2011, the House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity held a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs. On March 9, 2011, the committee considered and approved H.R. 861. On March 2, 2011, the House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs. During the markup on March 9, 2011, the committee approved an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. The notice directs citizens to contact their representatives and officials regarding foreclosure impacts on communities. An amendment was voted on to require HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. The notice directs citizens to contact their representatives and officials regarding foreclosure impacts on communities. Representative Miller criticized the program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars, advocating for funding to be redirected towards reducing the federal debt and deficit. During a subcommittee hearing and markup session, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and wasteful, advocating for funding to be rescinded due to the need to address federal debt. Others argued that the program successfully helps communities combat the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. During a subcommittee hearing, Representative Miller criticized NSP-3 funding as wasteful due to federal debt concerns. However, others defended the program, citing its success in assisting communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. HUD's Assistant Secretary stated that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties in hard-hit markets. During a hearing, HUD's Assistant Secretary mentioned that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties in hard-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support over 93,000 jobs nationwide and helps reduce abandoned, blighted, and foreclosed housing stock. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011. The Secretary's testimony highlighted that NSP1 is projected to create over 93,000 jobs nationwide and aid in reducing abandoned, blighted, and foreclosed housing stock. The House approved the measure on March 16, 2011, with a vote of 242 to 182, but a companion bill has not been introduced in the Senate."
