The Congress finds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a severe economic downturn and significant job losses. In 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA were involved in addressing the crisis. The financial crisis of 2008 led to the failures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, resulting in the deepest economic decline since World War II and the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. In September 2008, the two GSEs were placed in conservatorship by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA. Additionally, a $200 billion facility was established to purchase senior preferred stock. The government took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, providing financial support through a $200 billion facility. In 2009, the Obama Administration increased the stock purchase commitment to $400 billion and removed limits on Federal funds to cover losses. In February 2009, the Obama Administration raised the senior preferred stock purchase commitment to $400 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On Christmas Eve 2009, the Administration removed limits on Federal funds to cover losses, resulting in taxpayers owning at least 80% of the two GSEs. The Obama Administration has committed over $110 billion in taxpayer funds to purchase senior preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, resulting in taxpayers owning at least 80% of the two enterprises. The Administration is using the GSEs as instruments of Federal housing policy, making it unlikely they will be returned to private ownership. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now effectively government entities. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are being used by the Administration for Federal housing policy, making their return to private ownership less likely. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that they have effectively become government entities and are expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now considered government entities and are expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates. Despite this, in 2009, the Treasury Department approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of both entities, including $2,000,000 in incentive pay each. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2009, including $2,000,000 in incentive pay each, which is significantly higher than the annual compensation of the President and Cabinet Secretary. Additionally, multi-million dollar compensation packages were approved for other top executives of the GSEs, payable in cash. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved $2,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2009, 15 times more than the President's annual compensation and 30 times more than a Cabinet Secretary's. Multi-million dollar compensation packages were also approved for other top executives, payable in cash. FHFA determined that GSEs' top executives would not receive cash bonuses or long-term incentives in 2008 as part of their commitment to operate in a safe and sound manner. FHFA's Strategic Plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac includes a commitment to operate in a safe manner. Section 1318(c) of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act allows FHFA to withhold executive compensation. The Director of FHFA can withhold executive compensation for review under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION.
