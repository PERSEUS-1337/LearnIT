    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus, initially called \"swine flu,\" emerged globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) later named the disease and explained its origin in pigs, where different flu viruses can reassort and create new strains. This reassortment has already occurred in pigs in the United States. The influenza virus can infect pigs simultaneously with avian, human, and swine viruses, leading to gene reassortment and the emergence of new virus strains. This reassortment has been observed in pigs in the United States since 1998, with genes from avian and human flu circulating among swine. The currently circulating H1N1 virus is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human genes, with an unknown origin and timing of occurrence. The currently circulating Influenza A (H1N1) virus in the United States since 1998 is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human genes. The origin and timing of this reassortment are unknown, and it is now being transmitted from human to human. The role of swine in the emergence of this virus is under investigation. WHO refers to it as Influenza A(H1N1), while the CDC calls it 2009 H1N1 flu. The virus Influenza A(H1N1) is now being transmitted from human to human in a sustained manner. Its origin is unknown, but it is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human genes. The virus, also known as H1N1, is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza. Researchers are uncertain about its virulence as it continues to spread globally. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported two children in California had recovered from a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses. Two days later, five more H1N1 cases were reported, three in California and two in Texas. Mexico's Health Ministry announced a new strain of influenza affecting the country on April 24, 2009. CDC reported two children in California recovered from a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses. Five more H1N1 cases were reported, three in California and two in Texas. Mexico's Health Ministry announced a new strain of influenza affecting the country, with over 1,000 suspected cases. Public gatherings were canceled in Mexico City and surrounding states. A new strain of influenza was affecting Mexico, with over 1,000 suspected cases. The Mexican government closed schools and canceled public gatherings in Mexico City and surrounding states. WHO reported human cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. The influenza pandemic alert level was raised from Phase 4 to Phase 5. On April 27, 2009, WHO reported human cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. Two days later, the influenza pandemic alert level was raised from Phase 4 to Phase 5 by WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan. Phase 5 indicates human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, signaling an imminent pandemic. Phase 5 of the influenza pandemic alert level indicates human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, signaling an imminent pandemic. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, as the virus was characterized as \"moderately severe\" with the potential to become more virulent. On June 11, 2009, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, due to the moderately severe H1N1 virus. By June 22, 2009, over 50,000 human cases had been confirmed in 80 countries with 231 deaths reported. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 human cases of H1N1 in 80 countries with 231 deaths. The number of cases may be higher as it only includes confirmed cases. There is no risk of contracting the virus from well-cooked food. More people may have contracted H1N1 than officially reported, as the number of cases reflects only those confirmed by laboratory testing. The risk of contracting the virus from well-cooked pork is low, according to FAO, OIE, and WHO. WHO advises against limiting travel, as it would have little effect on stopping the virus spread but could disrupt the global community. However, those who are ill should delay international travel. According to WHO, most people who have contracted H1N1 have experienced influenza-like symptoms and recovered without antiviral treatment. Drugs provided to H1N1 patients may reduce symptoms and duration of illness, similar to seasonal influenza. According to WHO, most people with H1N1 experience influenza-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs can reduce symptoms, duration of illness, and prevent severe disease and death. Older antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness against the new strain of H1N1. The strain of H1N1 circulating globally is a new virus, and antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir have been effective against it. WHO has a stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated by manufacturers and donor countries. This stockpile was initiated after the onset of H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Currently available antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir have been effective against H1N1. WHO has a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated by manufacturers and donor countries, initiated after H5N1 outbreaks. WHO is distributing 3 million treatment courses to developing countries. No vaccine is available for the current strain of H1N1, but efforts are underway to develop one. The WHO is distributing 3 million adult treatment courses of antiviral drugs to developing countries to combat flu outbreaks. Efforts are being made to develop a vaccine against the current strain of H1N1, with estimates that it could take five to six months to mass-produce once modified. At least 1 to 2 billion vaccine doses could be produced annually once a vaccine is developed. Seasonal influenza vaccines do not protect against H1N1. WHO and CDC are preparing vaccine candidate viruses, estimating 5-6 months for mass production. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline plan to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO. Most countries follow WHO's advice against travel bans. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline plan to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. China quarantined Mexican nationals, leading to Mexico barring flights to China until discrimination concerns were addressed. No other country has taken similar actions. Mexico responded to China's quarantine of Mexican nationals by banning flights to China until discrimination concerns were addressed. Some countries have advised against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico, with the European Union Health Commissioner urging Europeans to postpone such travel. The CDC also recommended caution regarding travel to the United States and Mexico. On April 27, 2009, the European Union Health Commissioner advised Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico, later downgrading it to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico. On May 15, 2009, the CDC downgraded its recommendation for U.S. travelers to Mexico to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified that closing the border with Mexico would have minimal benefits as the virus strain was already present throughout the United States. The focus now is on mitigating the virus rather than containment through border closures. The committee hearing discussed the limited benefits and high costs of closing the U.S. border to Mexico due to the virus strain already being present throughout the country. Countries are implementing thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers with high body temperatures. Closing U.S. borders to mitigate the virus may pose legal and logistical challenges. Some countries are using thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures, but the effectiveness of this measure is debated. Egypt has ordered the slaughter of pigs to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals, and some countries have banned the import of pork. Several countries have taken actions to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals, including Egypt ordering the slaughter of pigs. Some countries have also banned the import of pork products. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate the U.S. humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks.

USAID pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. A three-day pandemic preparedness exercise was held in Ethiopia as part of the H2P Initiative, bringing together stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. The exercise aimed to identify roles, establish coordination principles, develop a pandemic response action plan, and test existing ones. Authorities from nine East African countries, including civilian and military representatives, met in Ethiopia to establish coordination principles, develop a pandemic response action plan, and test existing ones through a simulation exercise. This exercise aimed to prepare governments for potential influenza pandemics originating from various sources and address cross-border movement challenges. Participants in the session underwent a simulation exercise to test and improve their preparedness plans for potential influenza pandemics. The exercises help governments prepare for outbreaks from various sources and address cross-border movement challenges. USAID plans to conduct similar exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009. USAID is working with national leaders to address cross-border movement challenges during potential influenza outbreaks. They are conducting simulation exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009. Additionally, USAID is collaborating with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness for cooperation with civilian authorities. In August 2009, USAID collaborated with the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness for cooperation with civilian authorities during a pandemic. USAID also conducted a joint pandemic preparedness exercise with PACOM, AFRICOM, and the World Food Program (WFP) involving 27 African and Asian countries in May 2009. In FY2005, Congress provided emergency supplemental funds for U.S. technical assistance efforts related to global pandemic influenza preparedness and response, including training health workers in foreign countries for potential pandemics like H5N1 avian flu and H1N1. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, making up 30.9% of international donor pledges.

The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for domestic and international H1N1 activities. The bill did not specify how much of the $200 million CDC should spend on international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with recent outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS raising concerns. The conference report did not specify how much of the $200 million CDC should spend on international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with recent outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS raising concerns about global security. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 has demonstrated the threat that infectious diseases pose, with about 75% of diseases originating from animals. Effective responses to these growing threats are crucial. The emergence of infectious diseases like influenza A H1N1 and SARS has raised concerns about global security. About 75% of diseases originate from animals, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the United States and other international players aim to prepare for potential pandemics and monitor the spread of infectious diseases. Effective responses to the threat of infectious diseases require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors, including agriculture and animal health. Investments made by the United States and other international players have been applied to the recent global response to H1N1, leading to significant progress in developing tests, treatments, and a global surveillance system. Some health experts have made progress in developing strain-specific tests and effective treatments against H1N1. Concerns remain about poorer countries lacking the capacity to monitor and respond to the disease. It is cautioned not to become complacent as influenza transmission tends to accelerate in winter months. Countries in the Southern hemisphere are just beginning to face the threat of H1N1. Some health experts are concerned about poorer countries lacking the capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1. It is cautioned not to become complacent as influenza transmission tends to accelerate in winter months. Questions remain about the potential for the virus to change or reassort its genes, especially in countries dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Some countries in the southern hemisphere are starting to report H1N1 cases as they enter winter. Concerns arise about the virus potentially changing or reassorting its genes, especially in countries also dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks like Egypt, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Debate in May 2009 questioned whether WHO should maintain its pandemic phase system or develop an alert system based on severity. In May 2009, there was a debate about whether WHO should maintain its pandemic phase system or develop an alert system based on severity. Supporters argued for a severity-based system to prevent panic, while critics warned of economic and social disruptions if the pandemic threat level was raised to Phase 6. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, despite concerns about potential panic and economic disruptions. Director General Margaret Chan emphasized that the severity did not change. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic threat level to Phase 6 due to sustained human-to-human transmission of H1N1 in Japan. Director General Margaret Chan clarified that the severity did not change, and WHO updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide. WHO raised the pandemic threat level to Phase 6 due to sustained human-to-human transmission of H1N1 in Japan. The updated pandemic influenza guide outlines steps governments should take in planning for an epidemic. USAID announced a new five-year program to address emerging pandemic threats. The updated pandemic influenza guide outlines steps governments should take in planning for an epidemic. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to address emerging pandemic threats, focusing on diseases of animal origin that infect humans. USAID, in collaboration with CDC and USDA, is launching a program to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that can infect humans. The program aims to invest in establishing a network of laboratories in Africa to improve diagnosis of new pathogens. Concerns have been raised about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries with confirmed cases of H1N1. Africa is focusing on improving the ability to diagnose new emergent pathogens in both animal and human populations. Concerns have been raised about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries with confirmed cases of H1N1, with South Africa being the only country to have reported human cases. Surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa, except for South Africa and Botswana, are in poor condition, reflecting limited public health and surveillance capacity. Some experts suggest that the absence of H1N1 case reports from most African countries reflects limited public health and surveillance capacity. CDC and other international health experts are working to improve laboratory and disease surveillance systems in Africa by providing testing kits to various countries. The absence of disease in African countries is attributed to weak laboratory and disease surveillance capacity. CDC and other international health experts are working to improve these systems by providing H1N1 testing kits to various countries, including 18 in Africa. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission. Poor countries send viral samples to WHO collaborating centers in Atlanta, Britain, Japan, and Australia. Concerns have been raised about affordability and access to vaccines during global outbreaks like H5N1 avian flu and H1N1. Discussions on access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries have resurfaced during global outbreaks like H5N1 avian flu and H1N1. Concerns have been raised about affordability and access, with USAID estimating that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines. WHO also notes that over 50% of the poorest areas in Africa and Asia lack access to medicines. Additionally, more than 90% of the global capacity to develop influenza vaccines is located in Europe and North America. The recent H1N1 outbreaks have highlighted the link between access, poverty, and health. USAID estimates that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines, with over 50% of the poorest areas in Africa and Asia lacking access. WHO notes that more than 90% of the global capacity to develop influenza vaccines is in Europe and North America, raising concerns about access for poorer countries during a pandemic. Some worry that richer countries will hoard treatments and vaccines during a pandemic, leaving poorer countries reliant on donor generosity. Concerns also arise about the ability of poorer nations to effectively administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO stated it would not conduct mass H1N1 vaccination efforts, expecting national authorities to take on the task. Some argue that poorer countries may struggle to effectively administer mass vaccination campaigns, with concerns raised about their capacity to do so. WHO expects national authorities to undertake such efforts instead of conducting mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns themselves. Approximately 1.4 million deaths among children under five years of age in 2002 were due to diseases preventable by routine vaccination, representing 14% of total global child mortality. Health experts, including the WHO, are concerned about the severity of the H1N1 strain circulating globally. One worry is the potential co-circulation of H5N1 bird flu and H1N1, which could lead to the reassortment of the two flu strains. This poses a significant threat to public health. 14% of total global mortality in children under five years of age. Health experts, including the WHO, are concerned about the potential reassortment of H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 strains, which could create a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. Concerns about H5N1 causing an influenza pandemic began in 2004 when Thailand and Viet Nam reported their first human cases of avian influenza. In 2004, concerns about H5N1 causing a pandemic arose when Thailand and Viet Nam reported their first human cases of avian influenza. The virus strains to create new strains with the potential to cause human illness. By 2006, about 50 countries worldwide had confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with the disease becoming endemic in Asia. Health experts are monitoring if countries with ongoing H5N1 cases will also see H1N1 cases. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with the disease becoming endemic in Asia. Health experts are monitoring if countries with ongoing H5N1 cases will also see H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu kills about 60% of humans who contract the virus, but it is not as easily transmissible as H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds. In 2008 and 2009, only Indonesia and Cambodia have not reported H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu kills about 60% of humans who contract the virus, but it is not as easily transmissible as H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds."
