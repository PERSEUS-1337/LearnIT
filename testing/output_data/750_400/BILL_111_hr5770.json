The Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming more accessible to shipping due to thinning ice cover, technological improvements, and growing demand for Arctic tourism and resources. It is in the interests of the United States to work with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe shipping in the region. The United States aims to collaborate with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, protecting the natural environment and meeting the needs of Arctic resource users. The United States aims to ensure safe and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, protecting the environment and respecting the rights of Arctic resource users. The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, protect sovereign and security interests, provide access for research vessels, and maintain peaceful relations in the region. Additionally, the US supports international cooperation for reliable shipping. The United States supports international cooperation for reliable shipping in the Arctic, including investments in mariners aids to navigation, ports of refuge, vessel-to-shore communication, hydrographic mapping, and search and rescue capability. The United States supports international cooperation for reliable shipping in the Arctic, including investments in mariners aids to navigation, ports of refuge, vessel-to-shore communication, hydrographic mapping, and search and rescue capability. Mariners and sea-faring nations have sought benefits from Arctic sea routes similar to those of the Panama and Suez canals for nearly 500 years. However, as expanded shipping in the Arctic poses risks to residents, coordinated shipping regulations are necessary to protect US interests outside territorial waters. Proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways exist, including joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada and cooperation between the Coast Guard and its Russian counterpart for fisheries enforcement in the Bering Sea and North Pacific regions. The United States has interests in the Arctic that rely on icebreaker platforms of the Coast Guard, which are in need of replacement. The United States has interests in the Arctic and North Pacific regions, with a need to replace outdated icebreaker platforms of the Coast Guard. Sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may increase with a potential United States claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers and international plans for navigation aids are essential for these interests. The United States has interests in the Arctic and North Pacific regions, with a need to replace outdated icebreaker platforms of the Coast Guard. Sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may grow with a potential United States claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers, international plans for navigation aids, and coordinated shipping regulations are essential for these interests. Coordinated international efforts are crucial for shipping regulations and oil spill prevention in the Arctic. Initiating these efforts now, following the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, is vital to protect US interests in the region. The Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation is outlined in Section 3. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to enter into agreements through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action among Arctic nations. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to enter into negotiations through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action among Arctic nations for aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, maritime domain awareness, and search and rescue in the Arctic region. Arctic nations must ensure aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, maritime domain awareness, and search and rescue capabilities in the region. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System will coordinate domestic transportation policies in the Arctic to support these efforts. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System will coordinate the establishment of domestic transportation policies in the Arctic. The Secretary of the department may enter into agreements to carry out the purpose of this section. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may enter into agreements, contracts, or grants to carry out the purpose of this section. Icebreaking for safe maritime navigation is promoted where needed. The Secretary of Transportation may also enter into agreements or grants for demonstration projects. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates promotes safe maritime navigation through icebreaking. The Secretary of Transportation can enter agreements for demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic and train mariners. The Secretary of Transportation can provide grants for demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic and train mariners for ice navigation and Arctic operations. Authorization of appropriations is also specified. Authorization of appropriations for ice navigation and Arctic operations includes $5,000,000 for seasonal operations in the Arctic and $10,000,000 for agreements under subsection (d) for fiscal years 2011-2015. Additionally, $5,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Transportation for each fiscal year. Authorization of appropriations for ice navigation and Arctic operations includes $5,000,000 for seasonal operations in the Arctic and $10,000,000 for agreements under subsection (d) for fiscal years 2011-2015. Additionally, $5,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Transportation for each fiscal year to conduct demonstration projects. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of icebreakers for Arctic operations. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers or constructing new ones for Arctic operations. The Coast Guard will analyze extending the service life of existing icebreakers or building new ones for Arctic operations to maintain a presence in the region. The Coast Guard will analyze the impact on mission capacity and presence in the Arctic regions through 2020 if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. Reports to Congress are due within 90 days. The Coast Guard will assess the impact on Arctic mission capacity by 2020 if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. A report to Congress is due within 90 days. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will submit a report with study results and recommendations to Congress after the completion of the High Latitude Study on Arctic ice-breaking mission requirements. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will submit reports with study results and recommendations to Congress, including those deemed appropriate under section 93(a)(24) of title 14, United States Code, to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The Commandant will submit reports with study results and recommendations to Congress, including those deemed appropriate under section 93(a)(24) of title 14, United States Code, to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. Within 270 days of enactment, the Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to relevant committees assessing the need for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions for various missions. This includes search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report should include an assessment of operating needs in high latitude areas. The report must assess Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions for missions like search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce.
