Eight fundamental operations are identified and learned using feed forward neural networks. In this work, 8 fundamental operations commonly used in arithmetic are identified and learned using simple neural networks. These operations can be reused to develop larger networks for tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. This approach introduces reusability and allows for generalization.

The bottom-up strategy introduces reusability and allows for generalization up to 7 digit numbers, including both positive and negative numbers. The success of feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks lies in their ability to learn and develop internal structures. Our solution for n-digit computations generalizes for up to 7 digit numbers, including positive and negative numbers. The success of feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks lies in their ability to learn and develop internal structures, but they often lack generalization and performance degrades on unseen data. The learning process in neural networks is dependent on the data provided during training, leading to a lack of generalization and performance degradation on unseen data. Techniques like Domain Adaptation can help address these issues, but the behavior suggests that neural networks primarily rely on memorization rather than understanding inherent rules. The learning process in neural networks relies on memorization rather than understanding inherent rules, lacking quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction. In contrast, other intelligent beings, such as children, demonstrate numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning as fundamental capabilities. The decision making process in artificial neural networks lacks quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction, unlike other intelligent beings such as children who demonstrate numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning in their learning process. Children can memorize single digit arithmetic operations and then apply it to higher digits, indicating that generalization is based on reusing memorized examples.

Our proposed network expands on existing models by predicting the output of basic arithmetic functions for both positive and negative decimal integers. Unlike current methods that use a single neural network for different tasks, we suggest training multiple smaller networks for various subtasks to tackle complex arithmetic operations like signed multiplication. Our proposed approach involves training multiple smaller networks for different subtasks in complex arithmetic operations like signed multiplication, division, and cross product. By combining these smaller networks, we can design networks capable of handling complex tasks, similar to LSTM models.

The addition module is implemented using a single neuron with linear activation. The neuron network simplifies creating a neural network for addition and subtraction by using weighted inputs passed through an activation function. Addition is implemented with weights {+1, +1} and subtraction with weights {+1, \u22121}. This facilitates shift-and-add multiplication. The subtraction module consists of a single neuron with two inputs and weights {+1, \u22121}. It facilitates shift-and-add multiplication by multiplying digits of the multiplier with digits of the multiplicand. The output is then shifted to the appropriate position and added to obtain the final output. The multiplication module operates by multiplying digits of the multiplier with digits of the multiplicand from right to left. The results are combined and shifted to the correct position for addition to get the final output. This module uses fixed weights for each preceding digit and can handle n inputs with 1 digit each.
