    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. The EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options to address them. Congress has added five titles to TSCA and made amendments since its inception. Since its inception in 1976, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) authorizes the EPA to regulate chemicals in the U.S. commerce to prevent harm. Congress has added titles and made amendments to TSCA, but none address the core program under Title I. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process and address related purposes. Since 2005, bills have been introduced to revise the chemical evaluation process under TSCA, but there is ongoing legislative debate on amending regulatory criteria and other elements of the law. More chemicals have entered the U.S. market since TSCA's enactment in 1976, leading to an increase in studies on chemical risks. Since the enactment of TSCA in 1976, more chemicals have entered the U.S. market, leading to an increase in studies on chemical risks. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework for chemicals is not sufficiently protective of the public or the environment. Studies on chemical risks have been published, and scientific understanding of chemical risks has continued to evolve. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework for chemicals is not sufficiently protective of the public or the environment, leading to potential differences in regulation among states. EPA's evaluation of risks is dependent on available resources. Manufacturers and processors of chemicals argue that complying with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient due to interstate commerce. Proponents of state regulations believe states can lead in trying alternative approaches. Manufacturers and processors argue that complying with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient due to interstate commerce. Proponents of state regulations believe states can lead in trying alternative approaches, including non-governmental programs like voluntary labeling. This report tracks legislative status in the 114th Congress of bills amending Title I of TSCA. In the 114th Congress, bills have been introduced in both chambers to amend Title I of TSCA, tracking legislative status and discussing selected issues. Non-governmental programs for labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic\" have emerged as an alternative approach to regulation. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were introduced in the 114th Congress to amend Title I of TSCA. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up an amendment for S. 697, which was reported out for Senate floor consideration. House actions were also taken in April 2015. On March 18, 2015, Senate EPW held a hearing on S. 697 and on April 28, 2015, marked up an amendment for the bill. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce announced a more targeted approach with the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 on April 7, 2015. On April 7, 2015, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, a more targeted approach to amending Title I of TSCA. The subcommittee held a hearing on April 14, 2015, and on May 14, 2015, ordered the revised draft to be forwarded to the full House Committee for consideration. On May 26, 2015, H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced. On April 14, 2015, the subcommittee held a hearing on the House discussion draft. On May 14, 2015, the subcommittee ordered the revised draft to be forwarded to the full House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration. H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced on May 26, 2015. The bill was approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 3, 2015, with technical amendments. The TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 was introduced and approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce with technical amendments. The House passed H.R. 2576 on June 23, 2015. Key debated issues include the prioritization of existing chemical substances for evaluation under Title I of TSCA. The committee's report for the bill H.R. 2576, H.Rept. 114-176, was passed by the House on June 23, 2015. Key debated issues include the prioritization of existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting chemicals, EPA's options for regulation, authority to require new information, and preemption of state laws. The report compares approaches in amending Title I of TSCA among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 to address key issues such as risk evaluation of existing chemical substances, regulatory criteria for restriction, EPA's regulatory options, authority for new information development, preemption of state laws, and disclosure protection. The report compares approaches in amending Title I of TSCA among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 to address key issues such as risk evaluation of existing chemical substances, regulatory criteria for restriction, EPA's regulatory options, authority for new information development, preemption of state laws, and disclosure protection. The evaluation of risks for the large number of chemicals in the marketplace is limited by finite resources, determining criteria for selecting chemicals to evaluate is a perennial issue under the current TSCA. EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical substances for risks without a mandate. In amending Title I of TSCA, EPA has discretion in selecting which chemicals to evaluate for risks from the marketplace. Criteria for choosing chemicals to evaluate is a perennial issue due to limited resources. The agency may evaluate substances on the initial inventory reported under TSCA Section 8(a) and those reported in premanufacture notices under Section 5. The EPA has discretion in selecting chemicals for risk evaluation from the marketplace, with criteria based on limited resources. Over 83,000 chemical substances, including those on the initial inventory and reported in premanufacture notices, may be evaluated. In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for potential evaluation based on prioritization criteria. In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for evaluation based on prioritization criteria. From these, 90 substances were prioritized for risk evaluation, with EPA assessing five chemicals, three of which were found to present risks. EPA requires manufacturers to submit a PMN for new chemicals under Section 5 of TSCA. EPA prioritized 90 substances for risk evaluation based on hazard, exposure, and bioaccumulation potential. Of the 90 chemicals, EPA assessed five, with three found to present risks. Section 5 of TSCA mandates manufacturers to submit a PMN for new chemicals, allowing EPA to evaluate risks and determine if regulation is necessary. EPA evaluates new chemical substances through PMNs submitted 90 days prior to manufacturing, with exemptions possible. Over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemption applications received from 1979 to 2010. S. 697, S. 725 prioritize existing chemicals for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 evaluates based on specific criteria. EPA assesses risks and determines regulation based on PMNs and existing data. EPA received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemption applications from 1979 to 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 prioritize existing chemicals for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 evaluates based on specific criteria, giving EPA discretion to assess chemicals with potential unreasonable risks. The Senate bills differ in factors and criteria used for prioritization. H.R. 2576 and Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 propose different approaches to evaluating chemicals for potential risks. H.R. 2576 gives EPA discretion to assess chemicals based on specific criteria, while the Senate bills prioritize substances for evaluation using various factors. Both aim to conduct risk-based safety evaluations on existing chemical substances. The Senate bills propose a process to divide existing chemical substances into active and inactive substances, prioritize substances for evaluations based on various factors, conduct risk-based safety evaluations, and take regulatory action. The bills also address prioritization of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances. The bills propose a process for prioritizing substances for safety evaluations and regulatory action. S. 697 and H.R. 2576 establish a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation, with EPA having discretion under S. 697 and being required to evaluate risks under H.R. 2576. The bills propose a process for prioritizing substances for safety evaluations and regulatory action. S. 697 and H.R. 2576 establish a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation, with varying deadlines for evaluating chemical substances and taking regulatory actions. EPA would be required to make every effort to designate all active substances as high-priority or low-priority substances under S. 697. S. 697 and S. 725 propose a prioritization process for evaluating chemical substances with varying deadlines for regulatory actions. EPA would designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and start safety assessments within five years of enactment. Safety assessments must be completed within three years of designation. The proposed legislation requires EPA to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority for safety assessment within five years of enactment, with assessments to be completed within three years of designation. The process is comparable to existing procedures but with tighter deadlines and some differing conditions. The proposed legislation requires EPA to designate chemicals as high priority for safety assessment within a specified timeframe, with assessments to be completed within a set deadline. H.R. 2576 outlines specific requirements for risk evaluations, including timelines and the number of evaluations to be initiated annually. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they cover the costs. S. 697 and S. 725 focus on new chemical substances and establishing a review process under TSCA Section 5. H.R. 2576 requires EPA to conduct 10 risk evaluations annually, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they pay for it. S. 697 and S. 725 focus on new chemical substances and establishing a review process under TSCA Section 5. EPA would need to determine if regulatory action is necessary for new chemicals under the Senate bills. H.R. 2576 does not change the current process for EPA to evaluate risks of new chemicals. The Senate bills require EPA to make a determination on regulatory action for new chemicals within 90 days of receiving a PMN. The Senate bills would direct EPA to conduct an initial review of new chemicals within 90 days of receiving a PMN to determine if they meet safety standards. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to the same procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA establishes a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the risk of harm to human health or the environment. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would undergo the same safety assessment and determination procedures as existing chemicals under proposed Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725. The current TSCA sets a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the risk of harm to human health or the environment. Some argue that the threshold for restricting a chemical under TSCA is difficult for the EPA to prove and open to interpretation. This issue has been a recurring concern in the TSCA debate. Some argue that the existing regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals under TSCA is challenging for the EPA to demonstrate and open to interpretation. The debate revolves around amending the threshold to clarify criteria for determining regulatory control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is not clearly defined in statute but has been interpreted at the circuit court level. The TSCA debate focuses on amending the regulatory threshold to clarify criteria for determining regulatory control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is not clearly defined in statute but has been interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test at the circuit court level. The Fifth Circuit interpreted TSCA's \"unreasonable risk\" standard as a multi-factor balancing test in the influential 1991 decision, Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA. The court emphasized considering costs and carrying out actions in a reasonable and prudent manner, taking into account environmental, economic, and social impacts. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately, leading to an unreasonable risk assessment based on spending $200-$300 million to save approximately seven lives over thirteen years. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the EPA's asbestos ban did not adequately consider costs, leading to an unreasonable risk assessment based on spending $200-$300 million to save approximately seven lives over thirteen years. This highlights the importance of balancing costs and benefits in regulating substances under the current TSCA standards. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" that uses the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA and adds qualifiers related to the conditions of use of a chemical substance. S. 697 would define a safety standard as \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" and include qualifiers related to the conditions of use of a chemical substance. It would also consider potentially exposed populations and prohibit the consideration of cost and non-risk factors in evaluating risks. S. 697 and S. 725 both define safety standards for evaluating chemical risks, with S. 697 explicitly including potentially exposed populations and prohibiting the consideration of cost and non-risk factors. S. 725 would establish a safety standard ensuring no harm from chemical exposure, similar to S. 697. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA. It adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, such as assessing risks to potentially exposed populations. H.R. 2576 retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors in decision-making. H.R. 2576 prohibits EPA from considering costs or non-risk factors when evaluating risks to exposed populations under TSCA. EPA must focus on determining unreasonable risks to health or the environment without balancing costs and benefits. Title I of TSCA acknowledges the need to balance costs and benefits when determining unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment. EPA is directed to implement regulations that adequately protect against such risks using the least burdensome requirement while considering factors like the costs of regulation and availability of alternatives. Section 6 of TSCA requires EPA to establish regulations that protect against risks using the least burdensome requirement, considering factors like costs and alternatives. The regulatory options range from bans to notifications of risks to distributors. Some argue that this requirement may lead to lengthy analyses by the agency. The EPA's regulatory options for risk protection under TSCA vary in severity, from bans to notifications of risks to distributors. The \"least burdensome\" requirement may lead to lengthy analyses, as seen in the case of Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA where the Fifth Circuit questioned the total ban on asbestos as the least burdensome alternative. This requirement adds an extra standard for EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. In Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit questioned EPA's total ban on asbestos, stating that EPA must show each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risk. The \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of regulatory options for chemical substances. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome requirement for EPA in choosing regulatory options. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to remove the EPA's requirement to choose the least burdensome regulatory option for restricting chemical substances. Instead, they propose selecting options that are \"necessary\" to meet safety standards, considering factors like costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 specifically focuses on protecting potentially exposed subpopulations and amending factors for EPA to consider when restricting a chemical substance. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to promulgate rules that protect against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations. It would also amend factors for EPA to consider when restricting a chemical substance and require rules to be cost-effective, except when not practicable. All three bills allow EPA to exempt certain chemical substance uses under specific circumstances. The bills would require EPA to promulgate rules to protect against risks from chemical substances, with a focus on cost-effectiveness. EPA can exempt certain uses if compliance is not feasible due to national security, economic disruption, or lack of safer alternatives. EPA would be authorized to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of a chemical substance if compliance is not feasible due to national security, economic disruption, or lack of safer alternatives. H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of a chemical substance if deemed necessary for national security, economic stability, or critical infrastructure. Exemptions are initially valid for five years and can be renewed for additional five-year periods if requirements are still met. EPA aims to reduce risk to the greatest extent possible. EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for up to five years, renewable for additional five-year periods if requirements are met. The agency relies on scientific information to evaluate risks of chemical substances. EPA is authorized to require reporting and record-keeping on chemicals by manufacturers, processors, and distributors. EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for up to five years, renewable for additional five-year periods if requirements are met. The agency relies on scientific and technical information to evaluate risks of chemical substances and determine if any risks are unreasonable. Section 8 of TSCA authorizes EPA to require reporting and record-keeping on chemicals by manufacturers, processors, and distributors. If risks are insufficiently known, Section 4 of TSCA mandates EPA to promulgate a rule for testing by manufacturers and processors. EPA mandates testing for chemical substances if risks are unknown, based on threshold findings of unreasonable risks or substantial production leading to environmental exposure or human exposure. Over 200 additional tests have been required by EPA to date. The EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances due to threshold findings of unreasonable risks or substantial production leading to environmental or human exposure. Some argue that limits on EPA's authority under TSCA have hindered its ability to assess chemical risks. The EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances to assess risks, but limits on its authority under TSCA have hindered this process. EPA's ability to require new information on chemical risks is limited, leading to challenges in determining unreasonable risks. The EPA faces challenges in requiring new information on chemical risks due to limitations under TSCA. S. 697 and S. 725 would give EPA discretion to mandate testing based on its determination, potentially leading to lengthy and costly processes for those involved. The EPA may face challenges in obtaining new information on chemical risks, with S. 697 and S. 725 granting the agency discretion to require testing based on its determination. H.R. 2576, on the other hand, would still require specific findings for testing under TSCA Section 4 but would also allow EPA to mandate testing if necessary for risk evaluation under Section 6. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to make specific findings for testing under TSCA Section 4 but also authorize testing if necessary for risk evaluation under Section 6. All three bills allow EPA to require new information through rules, orders, or testing agreements, with the Senate bills emphasizing minimizing animal testing. The three bills would authorize EPA to require new information through rules, orders, or testing agreements, with a focus on minimizing animal testing. TSCA preemption remains a key issue with the increasing number of state chemical regulations. The scope of TSCA preemption is a long-standing issue, with conflicting state laws yielding to Congress's powers. Current TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals while allowing states some ability to set their own requirements. Current TSCA preemption gives EPA primary authority in managing chemicals, with states having limited ability to set their own requirements under certain circumstances. States are generally preempted from taking action if EPA has already addressed a similar risk, but exceptions exist for non-duplicative testing requirements. States can set their own chemical requirements under certain circumstances, with exceptions to preemption for non-duplicative testing requirements. Identical state requirements to federal laws are not preempted, allowing states to co-enforce them. States can also regulate disposal and establish chemical requirements under other federal laws. In the context of testing requirements, states can enforce identical requirements to federal laws, allowing them to regulate disposal and prohibit certain chemical uses within the state. Advocates argue for broader federal preemption to establish a uniform national regulatory framework for chemical safety. In the TSCA amendment context, advocates for broader federal preemption argue that a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals can reduce compliance costs and prevent conflicting state regulations. Opponents believe federal regulation should set a minimum standard without preempting state laws. S. 697 would make changes to TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management. Supporters of preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework to avoid conflicting state regulations and reduce compliance costs. Opponents believe states should have the flexibility to implement more stringent policies to protect their citizens. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management, allowing states to implement stricter policies to protect their citizens. The bill would change EPA actions triggering preemption, scope of state laws preempted, and waiver provisions. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical. S. 697 would modify EPA actions triggering preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements, the scope of preempted state laws, and waiver provisions. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals found safe by EPA or restricted by EPA for not meeting safety standards within EPA's scope of uses. Additionally, states could not establish new restrictions. States would be prohibited from restricting the manufacture, sale, or distribution of a chemical substance that EPA has deemed safe or restricted for not meeting safety standards within EPA's scope of uses. Additionally, states cannot establish new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority for safety assessment by EPA. S. 697 would preempt new state restrictions on high priority chemicals listed by EPA for safety assessment, based on EPA's safety assessment outcomes. S. 697 would retain preemption exceptions from current TSCA, except for states prohibiting chemical use. It would refine states' ability to enforce federal requirements without imposing additional penalties. New exceptions to preemption would be added. The current TSCA exceptions allowing states to enforce federal requirements without additional penalties would be refined, with new provisions prohibiting duplicative or more stringent sanctions. Additional exceptions to preemption would be added, allowing states to establish or enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. Certain state actions taken before August 1, 2015, and past or future actions under state laws in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be preempted. S. 697 would refine current TSCA exceptions for states to enforce federal requirements without additional penalties and add new provisions prohibiting duplicative sanctions. States could establish or enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws, with exceptions for actions taken before August 1, 2015, and past or future actions under state laws in effect as of August 31, 2003. EPA would also allow discretionary waivers for states based on peer-reviewed science concerns about a chemical. S. 697 would refine TSCA exceptions for states to enforce federal requirements without penalties and add provisions prohibiting duplicative sanctions. States could enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws, with exceptions for actions taken before August 1, 2015. EPA would allow discretionary waivers for states based on peer-reviewed science concerns about a chemical. H.R. 2576 and S. 725 propose changes to TSCA preemption provisions, with S. 725 allowing states more flexibility to regulate chemicals compared to H.R. 2576. EPA would have to grant waivers based on peer-reviewed science, with automatic waivers if no decision is made within 90 days or if deadlines are missed for safety determinations on chemicals. S. 725 and H.R. 2576 propose changes to TSCA preemption provisions, with S. 725 allowing states more flexibility to regulate chemicals. H.R. 2576 would provide for preemption of state laws if EPA determines a chemical does not pose an unreasonable risk. H.R. 2576 proposes preemption of state laws for chemicals deemed not to pose unreasonable risks by EPA, aligning with risk evaluation process under TSCA. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals based on EPA risk management actions, aligning with the risk evaluation process under the amended Section 6. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption, and states could enforce identical requirements to EPA's with penalties and sanctions. H.R. 2576 aligns with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6 of TSCA, maintaining preemption of state requirements for chemicals. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption, and states could enforce identical requirements to EPA's with penalties and sanctions. The bill also includes savings clauses for common law or statutory causes of action under tort or contract law. H.R. 2576 aligns with TSCA, maintaining preemption of state requirements for chemicals. It includes savings clauses for common law or statutory causes of action under tort or contract law. Chemical manufacturers must submit information to EPA regarding their chemicals, including chemical structures and health data. Balancing these concerns is an issue in amending TSCA. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers, processors, and distributors to provide information to EPA about their chemicals, including chemical structures, production volumes, and health data. Balancing public access to chemical information with protecting competitive information is a key concern in amending TSCA. Section 14 of TSCA prohibits disclosure of information exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The issue in amending TSCA is balancing public access to chemical information with protecting competitive information. Section 14 prohibits disclosure of information exempt from the Freedom of Information Act as trade secrets and commercial or financial information. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act under TSCA. Under the TSCA, information deemed as \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential\" is protected under the Freedom of Information Act. Wrongful disclosure of such information is considered a criminal act. Confidential business information (CBI) protection does not prevent the disclosure of health and safety studies, but data revealing manufacturing processes or proprietary mixtures is safeguarded. The EPA has protected various information, including chemical identities, as CBI under the TSCA Inventory and in health and safety studies. The TSCA protects trade secrets and confidential information under the Freedom of Information Act. Health and safety studies can be disclosed, but data revealing manufacturing processes or proprietary mixtures is safeguarded. The EPA has protected chemical identities as CBI in various situations. EPA may disclose CBI if necessary to protect health or the environment from unreasonable risk. TSCA Section 14 includes exceptions for disclosing CBI if EPA deems it necessary to protect health or the environment from unreasonable risk. If information designated as CBI does not meet protection standards, EPA must notify the submitter before disclosure. Submitters only need to designate information as CBI for protection, without requiring substantiation or EPA review of confidentiality claims. EPA must notify the information submitter before disclosing protected information designated as CBI. Submitters only need to label information as CBI for protection, without requiring substantiation or EPA review. CBI protection continues unless EPA determines otherwise. EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims since 2010, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims since 2010, particularly regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has also initiated the \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to encourage industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and enhance public access to non-confidential information. All three proposed bills aim to maintain the current TSCA framework for protecting information falling under the FOIA trade secrets exemption. The EPA has increased its scrutiny of confidentiality claims, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has launched the \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to urge industry to voluntarily retract CBI claims and improve public access to non-confidential information. The proposed bills aim to uphold the current TSCA framework for safeguarding information under the FOIA trade secrets exemption, while also allowing EPA to disclose CBI in certain additional circumstances. The proposed bills aim to allow EPA to disclose confidential business information (CBI) in specific circumstances, such as requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, environmental releases, or healthcare professionals for patient diagnoses and treatments. The Senate bills propose more extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA compared to H.R. 2576, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and additional review requirements for EPA. Certain categories of information would be presumed protected from disclosure. The Senate bills propose more detailed revisions to Section 14 of TSCA compared to H.R. 2576, with specific procedural requirements for information submitters and increased review requirements for EPA. Certain categories of information would be presumed protected from disclosure, including chemical identity before commercial distribution, while information on banned chemicals would not be protected. The confidentiality of chemical identities would be protected under H.R. 2576, with requirements for submitters to substantiate their claims every 10 years. This bill also limits substantiation requirements to claims made after enactment. H.R. 2576 aims to protect the confidentiality of chemicals' identities in health and safety studies by requiring submitters to substantiate their claims every 10 years. This bill also limits substantiation requirements to claims made after enactment and mandates EPA to notify submitters before the expiration date of their confidentiality claims. H.R. 2576 aims to protect chemical confidentiality claims by requiring submitters to substantiate them every 10 years. EPA must notify submitters before claim expiration. Congress must decide on funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or dedicated sources. Funding for EPA's TSCA activities can come from discretionary appropriations or dedicated sources. Congress has authorized appropriations for TSCA through FY1983, and continues to fund EPA's implementation through annual appropriations. EPA can also assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors, with no expiration date on this authority. EPA's fee collection authority is limited by statute. EPA can assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors under TSCA without a sunset date. The fees are limited to a maximum of $2,500 for specific actions required by the statute. EPA can assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors under TSCA, limited to a maximum of $2,500 for specific actions required by the statute. Small businesses have an exception with fees capped at $100. EPA can also assess fees for evaluating testing data submitted under Section 4 of the statute. Section 26(b) of TSCA allows EPA to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors for evaluating testing data, with small businesses having a fee cap of $100. The fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Fees collected under TSCA are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under TSCA Section 26(b) to varying degrees. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under TSCA Section 26(b) to varying degrees. S. 697 would authorize the collection of fees to accompany certain submissions of information to EPA regarding chemicals that the agency would be directed to evaluate, with fees set at levels to ensure funding availability. S. 697 authorizes EPA to collect fees for submissions of information on chemicals to be evaluated, with fees set to partially cover costs. Total fees capped at $18 million, deposited in a dedicated fund. The bill S. 697 authorizes EPA to collect fees to partially cover costs of evaluating chemical submissions, with a total cap of $18 million. Fees would be deposited in a dedicated fund and used without fiscal year limitation, subject to appropriations. The bill H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for evaluating chemical submissions. The fees would be deposited in a dedicated fund and used to cover evaluation costs without fiscal year limitation, subject to appropriations. EPA would have the authority to collect fees sufficient to defray certain costs. H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances, without a limit on the amount collected per submission. Fees would be deposited in a dedicated fund and made available to EPA without fiscal year limitation, subject to appropriations. H.R. 2576 and S. 697 propose establishing a fund for fees collected from chemical manufacturers, with no limit on the amount collected per submission. S. 725 also authorizes EPA to collect fees for various purposes and eliminates the current statutory limit on fee collection per notice submission under TSCA. S. 725, like S. 697 and H.R. 2576, aims to eliminate the current limit on EPA fees collected from chemical manufacturers under TSCA. Fees would be set at a level to support agency responsibilities, with funds deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for discretionary appropriations. S. 725, similar to S. 697 and H.R. 2576, removes the cap on EPA fees from chemical manufacturers under TSCA. Collected fees would go to the General Fund for discretionary appropriations, with cost estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office."
