Teenage drivers between 15 and 20 years old are involved in motor vehicle crashes resulting in an average of 167 deaths per week. Drivers aged 16-20 have a fatality rate 4 times higher than those aged 25-70, while 16-year-old drivers have a crash rate almost 10 times higher than those aged 30-60. According to the American Automobile Association. Teenage drivers aged 16 have a crash rate almost 10 times higher than drivers aged 30-60. Teenage drivers comprise slightly more than 1/3 of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly 2/3 of fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. According to the American Automobile Association, teenage drivers account for over 1/3 of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly 2/3 of fatalities being other individuals. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety states that the risk of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers aged 15-20. The risk of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers.

This was part of a trend where crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 25% in Michigan and 27% in North Carolina between 1995 and 1999. In 1997, North Carolina implemented a comprehensive graduated driver licensing system. According to the Automobile Club of Southern California, California's graduated driver licensing program led to a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries involving 16-year-old drivers between 1998 and 2000. Additionally, the number of at-fault collisions in California involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 24%. The National Transportation Safety Board also reported positive outcomes from these programs.

A 2001 Harris Poll shows strong support for requirements such as 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult and a 6-month learner's permit period. A 2001 Harris Poll reveals strong public support for laws protecting teenage and novice drivers, including requirements for practice driving hours, a learner's permit period, and limits on teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods. State graduated driver licensing laws are supported by the public, including requirements for practice driving hours, a learner's permit period, and limits on teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods. A State is compliant with graduated driver licensing laws if novice drivers under 21 follow a 2-stage process before getting an unrestricted license, starting with a learner's permit at 16 years old or older. The 2-stage licensing process for novice drivers includes a learner's permit stage starting at 16 years old, lasting at least 6 months, with restrictions on cellphone use and night driving. The learner's permit stage for novice drivers starts at 16 years old, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cellphone use and night driving, and remains in effect until the intermediate stage or the driver turns 18. The intermediate stage follows the learner's permit stage, lasting at least 6 months and prohibiting cellphone use for drivers until they reach 18 years of age. The intermediate stage of driving follows the learner's permit stage, lasting at least 6 months. During this stage, drivers are prohibited from using a cellphone or any communications device in nonemergency situations, driving at night, and having more than one non-familial passenger under 21 years of age unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 21 years old. During the intermediate stage of driving, restrictions include no cellphone use, driving at night, and limited passengers under 21 without a licensed driver over 21 present. Additional requirements may be imposed by the Secretary of Transportation. During the learner's permit stage, requirements include 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21, a driver training course, and other potential Secretary of Transportation requirements.
