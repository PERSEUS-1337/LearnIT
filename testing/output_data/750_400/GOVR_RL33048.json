The goal is to maintain the availability of these chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of exploitation by terrorists. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals are present in various transportation modes and commercial facilities. Congress and government agencies have been focused on federal regulations and programs related to hazardous chemicals security since September 11, 2001. The goal is to ensure the availability of these chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of exploitation by terrorists. Hazardous chemicals are present in various transportation modes and commercial facilities, with Congressional attention primarily on rail and tanker truck transportation and storage near populated areas. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 2651 would address federal policies for marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo. In the 109th Congress, attention is on federal policies for marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo, with proposed penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and vessels. Congress aims to enhance general port security, including foreign ports, in response to the security environment. In response to security concerns, Congress is focusing on enhancing penalties and security measures for hazardous chemical marine transportation. The report provides an overview of the risks associated with such transportation and highlights hazardous chemicals that pose a threat in a terrorist attack. The report discusses hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on risks in the homeland security context. It includes federal statistics on chemical shipments in U.S. waters and relevant maritime security regulations. Security policy issues related to these shipments are also raised. The report summarizes federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, including shipment volumes and port locations. It discusses relevant U.S. maritime security regulations and raises security policy issues associated with these shipments, such as risk uncertainties and security resources. The report concludes with a discussion on marine chemicals security as part of the nation's overall chemical security strategy. The report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the general public. It does not address other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report emphasizes threats to the public from chemical releases during marine transport. The report specifically examines marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the general public. It does not cover other potential maritime security hazards such as petroleum products, biological agents, or container bombs. The focus is on threats from chemical releases during marine transport, not marine attacks targeting economic activity or the environment. Detailed statistics for specific hazardous chemicals or ports are not provided due to legal limitations on proprietary shipping data. The report focuses on the potential threat posed by marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo, which are attractive targets for terrorists due to their toxicity and combustibility. These chemicals could pose a serious risk to human life and infrastructure if intentionally released near populated areas. The report does not provide detailed statistics on specific hazardous chemicals or ports due to legal limitations on proprietary shipping data. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility. They pose a serious threat to human life and infrastructure if released near populated areas. Protecting these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security strategy. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is vital for homeland security. While experts recognize the risk of terrorist attacks on marine shipments, no such incidents have occurred. However, accidents involving hazardous chemicals have shown the potential impact on nearby communities. Foreign terrorists have targeted other types of marine vessels. While no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used by terrorists in an attack on civilians, accidents involving such shipments have demonstrated their potential impact on nearby communities. Foreign terrorists have targeted other types of marine vessels overseas, and intelligence suggests that terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute hazardous chemical shipping attacks in the United States. Major accidents involving the marine transportation of hazardous chemicals are uncommon but can be deadly. Accidents involving hazardous chemical shipping have been deadly in the past, such as the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax and the 1947 explosion in Texas City. Intelligence suggests terrorists may target chemical shipping in the United States. Some of the deadliest industrial accidents in history include the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax, killing over 1,900 people, and the 1947 explosion in Texas City, killing nearly 600. Improved safety practices have prevented similar disasters, but incidents involving chemical marine shipments still pose threats. The Texas City disaster in 1947 killed nearly 600 people and injured 3,500. Since then, there have been serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments, such as fires aboard ships carrying toxic chemicals in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. Serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments have occurred, including fires aboard ships in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. These incidents did not result in serious casualties among neighboring communities, but emergency responders had a high degree of concern for public safety. Although terrorists have never used a marine cargo vessel to launch a chemical attack on the general public, both international combatants and domestic threats remain a concern. Serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments have occurred, including fires aboard ships in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. Emergency responders had a high degree of concern for public safety during these incidents. Although terrorists have not used marine cargo vessels for chemical attacks on the general public, there have been attempts to release chemicals from land-based facilities in the past. During the 1990s, both international combatants and domestic terrorists attempted to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities. Attacks occurred in foreign war zones like Croatia, targeting plants producing fertilizer, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals using hazardous chemicals. Similar incidents also occurred in the United States, with criminals trying to release chemicals from facilities like a propane storage facility. In the late 1990s, there were instances of criminals attempting to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities in the United States. Terrorists have also targeted marine vessels for attacks, including a foiled Al-Qaeda plot in June 2002 and the attack on the oil tanker Limburg in October 2002. In the late 1990s, criminals attempted to release chemicals from land-based facilities in the United States. Terrorists targeted marine vessels, including a foiled Al-Qaeda plot in June 2002 and the attack on the oil tanker Limburg in October 2002. Foreign governments expressed concerns about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is consistently concerned about security. In October 2002, the oil tanker Limburg was attacked off the Yemeni coast by a bomb-laden fishing boat. Foreign governments are concerned about terrorist groups hijacking hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is focused on securing chemical infrastructure, including tanker ships. The President's National Strategy includes terrorist attacks on ships carrying flammable and toxic chemicals as a hazard scenario for national preparedness standards. The Homeland Security Council is concerned about the security of chemical tanker ships and included terrorist attacks on ships carrying hazardous cargoes in U.S. homeland security national preparedness standards. The President's National Strategy highlights the challenge of protecting high consequence cargo in the port system, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers being a particular focus of public attention. DHS listed LNG tankers as potential terrorist targets in a security alert in late 2003. The President's National Strategy highlights the security challenge posed by hazardous marine cargo, specifically liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. The DHS considers LNG shipments as potential terrorist targets due to real risks that can never be entirely eliminated. Sandia National Laboratories' 2004 report deems terrorist attacks on LNG tankers as credible and possible, identifying them as vulnerable to various methods such as ramming and pre-placed explosives. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers, which are deemed vulnerable to various methods such as ramming, pre-placed explosives, insider takeover, hijacking, or external terrorist actions. HSPD-7 focuses on terrorist attacks on LNG tankers vulnerable to various methods like ramming, explosives, hijacking, or missile attacks. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial vessels could pose catastrophic hazards if accidentally released. The hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels could pose catastrophic hazards to the general public if accidentally released or combusted. Numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals, with relevant standards set by the Department of Transportation, the Coast Guard, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals for public security, regulated by the Department of Transportation, the Coast Guard, and the Environmental Protection Agency under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. This act empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate hazardous materials that may pose risks to health and safety. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates the transportation of hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. The act empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate materials that may pose risks when transported. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. Materials are grouped by type of hazard. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. Materials are grouped by type of hazard, and a ranking of relative hazard by general class or division is provided in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.2a. Shippers of \"highly hazardous\" cargo must develop security plans. The DOT ranks hazardous materials by type of hazard, with a summary provided in Appendix 1. Shippers of \"highly hazardous\" cargo must develop security plans for specific materials like radioactive, explosives, poisonous inhalation, bulk hazardous liquids, and gases. The DOT requires shippers of highly hazardous cargo to develop security plans for specific materials, including radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation substances, bulk hazardous liquids and gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous material, CDC-regulated agents, and materials requiring placarding. The Coast Guard regulates the safety and security of marine vessels and enforces federal hazardous material laws in U.S. waters, including identifying hazardous cargo in various sections of the federal code. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo in different sections of the federal code, including certain dangerous cargoes defined in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.204 and special requirements for vessels in 46 C.F.R. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, defining \"certain dangerous cargoes\" in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.204 and prescribing special requirements for vessels carrying hazardous materials in 46 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 148, 151, and 153. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, prescribing special requirements for vessels carrying hazardous materials such as bulk solid, liquid, liquified gas, compressed gas, and incompatible chemicals. Hazardous marine cargoes are also regulated at waterfront facilities. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying various hazardous materials. Hazardous marine cargoes are regulated at waterfront facilities, with hundreds of different hazardous materials included on the Coast Guard's lists. EPA regulates stationary facilities handling potentially hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. Congress passed P.L. 101-549 in 1990, amending the CAA to require facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances to file risk management plans (RMPs) that include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents. Congress passed P.L. 101-549 to amend the Clean Air Act, requiring facilities with certain quantities of hazardous substances to submit risk management plans (RMPs). These plans outline the potential threat from large substance releases, include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents, and detail prevention and mitigation measures. The amendments expanded the definition of \"hazardous substances\" to include 14 listed substances and gave the EPA authority to designate additional chemicals based on human health risks. The Clean Air Act Amendments expanded the definition of \"hazardous substances\" to include 14 listed substances and gave the EPA authority to designate additional chemicals based on human health risks. The EPA promulgated a list of acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, volatile flammable liquids, and high explosive substances. The EPA established a list of hazardous substances based on health risks, including acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. The list was amended in 2000 to exclude certain substances. The current EPA/RMP list can be found in Appendix 2. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous substances was established based on health risks, including acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. In 1998, high explosives were removed from the list due to a legal settlement. The list was further amended in 2000 to exclude flammable substances used as fuel or held for sale at retail facilities. Most hazardous materials on DOT and Coast Guard lists do not pose a catastrophic health hazard to the general public due to limited quantities or physical properties. The EPA list of hazardous substances focuses on chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the public, as they are considered among the most hazardous on land. These chemicals may also pose similar risks if transported on water. The EPA list of hazardous substances identifies chemicals with significant potential consequences to the public, including those that may pose risks during transportation on water. This report uses EPA/RMP chemicals as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most of these substances also found in DOT and Coast Guard hazardous materials lists. The report uses EPA/RMP chemicals for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most substances also found in DOT and Coast Guard lists. Explosives and radioactive materials, not on the EPA/RMP list, account for less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. The EPA/RMP chemicals used for marine cargo hazard analysis are cross-referenced with DOT categories. Explosives and radioactive materials, not included in the EPA/RMP list, make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. Excluding these two classes is unlikely to impact the policy conclusions in the report. EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. The EPA/RMP chemicals used for marine cargo hazard analysis are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. Excluding explosives and radioactive materials, which make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo, is unlikely to impact policy conclusions. Specific chemicals like Ammonia vary in toxicity and flammability based on their chemical properties. Ammonia is a toxic and potentially explosive gas used in various industries, including fertilizer manufacturing. It can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, or natural gas, is used for heating and industrial purposes. Ammonia is used as a protein source in livestock feeds and metal treatment operations. It can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, or natural gas, is used for heating and industrial purposes. Methane is a flammable and potentially explosive gas used as a heating fuel and industrial feedstock. It can cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations and freeze body parts on contact. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing various industrial products, with potential hazards to human health such as eye, skin, and respiratory irritation. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing polyurethane foam, solvents, and other industrial products. It can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract, and is highly flammable and reactive with certain substances. An uncontrolled release of this chemical could have varying effects on an exposed population. Methyloxirane vapor is highly flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. An uncontrolled release of this chemical could have varying effects on an exposed population. EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities to be hazardous to the general public. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities to be hazardous to the general public, warranting special regulatory treatment. The list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, with the assumption that all shipments are potential terrorist targets. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, assuming all shipments are potential terrorist targets. Certain chemicals may pose reduced hazards in marine incidents due to their properties, such as dissolving or sinking in water. Certain EPA/RMP chemicals have different health hazards when released over water compared to land. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing the hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create a larger hazard zone in a marine release. The characteristics of specific chemicals may differ between land and water releases. Certain EPA/RMP chemicals have different health hazards when released over water compared to land. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing the hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create a larger hazard zone in a marine release. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) maintains statistics of marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the marine hazards of specific chemicals. Further research and analysis are needed for a better understanding of the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) maintains statistics of marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. A subset of these chemicals are transported through U.S. waters in significant quantities, as shown in Table 1. Further research and analysis are required for a better understanding of the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. According to ACE statistics, a subset of EPA/RMP chemicals are transported in significant quantities through U.S. waters. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. In 2003, over 48 million tons of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included primarily because their chemical properties make them hazardous to human health. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included primarily because their chemical properties make them hazardous to human health. Evaluating potential public impacts of terrorist marine cargo hazards involves considering both size and number of shipments, as well as the overall volume of hazardous materials in a shipment. Over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways in 2003, posing a potential threat to public safety due to the large volume of hazardous materials present. The number of shipments plays a role in increasing the overall terrorist risk as it provides more opportunities for a successful attack. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways, increasing the potential terrorist risk due to the large volume of shipments. The data in Figure 1 shows the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment for hazardous chemicals. The ACE estimated the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment in 2003 for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. The data is plotted on a logarithmic scale in Figure 1. EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds. The dashed line in Figure 1 represents the 20,000 pound upper threshold for off-site consequence plans. The data in Figure 1 shows 2003 Marine Shipments of EPA/RMP Hazardous Chemicals, plotted on a logarithmic scale. EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds. The average shipment volume for these hazardous chemicals generally exceeds the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site consequence plans. Based on ACE data, most hazardous chemicals in Figure 1 exceed the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold for off-site consequence plans. The average waterborne shipment volume would require a risk management plan if stored on land. Each category of chemicals was shipped hundreds to thousands of times in 2003, making it difficult to distinguish between \"low frequency\" and \"high frequency\" hazardous cargoes. The curr_chunk discusses the transportation of hazardous cargo on marine vessels, highlighting the importance of vessel characteristics for security considerations. Different types of vessels are designed to carry specific quantities and physical properties of hazardous cargoes. The curr_chunk also mentions that each category of chemicals was shipped between several hundred and several thousand times in 2003, making it challenging to differentiate between \"low frequency\" and \"high frequency\" hazardous cargoes. Cargo vessels transporting hazardous materials have distinct construction and operating characteristics based on the type and quantity of cargo they carry. In 2003, over 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges, with an additional 29% in non-self-propelled liquid chemical barges. These characteristics are crucial for security considerations and determine the vulnerability of vessels to accidents or attacks. In 2003, the majority of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges, with a smaller percentage in non-self-propelled liquid chemical barges. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry liquefied gas cargo. Liquefied gas tankers are oceangoing ships designed to carry various types of liquefied gas cargo such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia, all chemicals on the EPA/RMP list. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, propylene, ethylene, vinyl chloride, methyl chloride, ammonia, and propylene oxide. The tanks on these vessels are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo requirements, with strict international standards for construction and operation. Liquefied gas tankers have onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to accommodate various cargoes. International shipping codes enforce strict standards for vessel construction and operation, with robust and resistant tanks designed to withstand high pressures or low temperatures. The vessels are double-hulled, with cargo tanks positioned above a double bottom and inside the outer hull, ensuring a high level of safety. LNG tankers are designed to withstand high pressures or low temperatures, making them robust and resistant to impact damage. They are double-hulled for added safety, with cargo tanks located above a double bottom and inside the outer hull. This structural integrity makes LNG tankers highly resistant to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers exclusively carry LNG, while other liquefied gas tankers may carry a combination of different cargoes in separate storage tanks. Liquefied gas tankers have high structural integrity, making them resistant to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers exclusively carry LNG, while other tankers may carry a combination of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. Tanker capacity varies greatly. Liquefied gas carriers vary in capacity, with fully pressurized ships carrying up to 4,300m3 of cargo. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000m3 to 147,000m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000m3 capacity ships. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity ships. Chemical parcel tankers can carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and range in total cargo capacity from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Most are well under 50,000 tons in capacity. Chemical parcel tankers can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks with a total capacity ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. They are governed by international construction standards and may have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, adhere to international construction standards with cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings. They have double bottoms or hulls to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes and can carry multiple hazardous chemicals simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges have multiple separate cargo tanks lined with special coatings and range in size from 700 tons to 3,500. Liquid chemical barges, ranging from 700 to 3,500 tons, are shallow draft vessels designed to transport hazardous chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways. Larger barges are double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Unpowered chemical barges on inland waterways are around 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long. Liquid chemical barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may be unpowered and rely on tugboats for movement. Inland barges usually travel in groups of two to eight per towboat, with \"linehaul\" tows sometimes consisting of more than 20 barges. These barges may be refrigerated and employ insulated cargo tanks. Liquid chemical barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may be refrigerated with insulated cargo tanks. Inland barges typically travel in groups of two to eight per towboat, with the possibility of \"linehaul\" tows consisting of more than 20 barges. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for pressurized liquid cargoes. Liquid chemical barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may be refrigerated with insulated cargo tanks. Hazardous chemicals can be transported on conventional container ships in various ways, including multi-modal tank containers, drums, portable tanks, or other cargo consignments. Roll-on/roll-off vessels may also carry such chemicals in tanker trucks or conventional tractor-trailers. Pressurized cargo tanks are available for pressurized liquid cargoes. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals can be transported on container ships in various ways, including tank containers, drums, and portable tanks. Roll-on/roll-off vessels may also carry these chemicals in tanker trucks or conventional tractor-trailers. For example, the Jolly Rubino was reported to be carrying 3 containers of vinyl acetate and 18 containers of other toxic chemicals when it caught fire off South Rotterdam, Netherlands in July 2005. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals can be transported on container ships in various ways, including tank containers, drums, and portable tanks. Hazardous chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas aboard these vessels, as well as on general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with EPA/RMP hazardous cargo in a given setting are a concern. Marine vessels, including container ships, can transport hazardous chemicals in designated cargo areas. Hazardous chemicals may also be shipped on general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with EPA/RMP hazardous cargo are proportional to volume, and comparisons can be made with other modes of transportation and storage facilities on land. Bulk transportation modes for hazardous chemicals include marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks. Comparing volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks is informative. Shipments may use all three modes sequentially. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Highway tanker trucks also transport hazardous cargoes with a standard capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons. Rail tank cars can carry up to 70 tons per tank, while highway tanker trucks have a standard capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons for transporting hazardous cargoes. Table 2 summarizes the typical cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers that transport EPA/RMP chemicals. Multiple tanks are usually found on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Table 2 summarizes the typical cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers that transport EPA/RMP chemicals. Marine tankers generally have a much larger capacity than rail or highway tanker trucks. Multiple tanks are common on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Comparing actual volumes can be complex due to partial cargoes and multiple barge or rail tank car shipments. The table shows that marine cargo tank capacity exceeds rail or highway tanker truck capacity by a significant amount. Comparing actual shipment volumes across modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple shipments. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous material are often larger than land shipments. Based on reported marine shipment volumes and rail/highway tank capacities, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous material are often larger than land shipments. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans under the Clean Air Act. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). These filings help estimate the maximum and average quantity of EPA/RMP chemicals across facilities. Marine shipping volumes are compared to land shipments, with marine shipments often being larger. The study compared marine and land storage volumes of nine EPA/RMP chemicals, including acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, ethylene, methyloxirane, oxirane, propene, sulfurdioxide, and vinyl chloride, representing high, medium, and low volume shipments of toxic and flammable chemicals. The study compared marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes of nine EPA/RMP chemicals, including acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, ethylene, methyloxirane, oxirane, propene, sulfurdioxide, and vinyl chloride. The comparison results are summarized in Table 3, sourced from the Army Corps of Engineers, EPA, and CRS analysis. Table 3 compares marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes of nine EPA/RMP chemicals. Marine shipments for higher volume chemicals were generally larger than volumes stored at chemical plants, consistent with shipping practices. The largest marine shipments were smaller than land storage volumes. The table compares marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. Marine shipments for higher volume chemicals were generally larger than volumes stored at chemical plants, consistent with shipping practices. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, serving as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, serving as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer to rail tank cars or truck tankers. Port facilities may also receive hazardous cargo directly for industrial processes like petrochemical refining, water treatment, and fertilizer production. Some port facilities produce hazardous cargo, with transportation and industrial facilities varying in prevalence among ports. Total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals are smaller compared to land storage volumes at chemical plants, except for chemical #3. Port facilities in U.S. ports receive hazardous marine cargo for industrial processes like petrochemical refining and water treatment. Some facilities also produce hazardous cargo. The volume and type of EPA/RMP chemicals vary across ports, affecting security hazards. Examining the concentration of hazardous marine shipments in U.S. ports can be helpful. The concentration of EPA/RMP hazardous marine shipments varies across U.S. ports. In 2003, 113 ports handled these chemicals, with the top 30 ports managing 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. In 2003, 113 U.S. ports handled EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports managing 95% of the cargo tonnage. Additional hazardous cargoes may also be shipped in large volumes through these ports. In 2003, 113 U.S. ports handled EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports managing 95% of the cargo tonnage. Additional hazardous cargoes may also be shipped in large volumes through these ports, with specific details listed in Table 4. In 2003, 22 EPA/RMP chemicals were shipped through the port of Baton Rouge in quantities exceeding 2,500 tons. Volumes of hazardous cargo in different ports are not related. Attacks on hazardous cargo vessels can have serious consequences. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are located in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico region. These ports are classified as coastal, except for one on the Ohio River. The mix of hazardous chemicals varies from port to port. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are located in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico region. Most ports are coastal, except for one on the Ohio River. The top two hazardous cargoes shipped through these ports are LPG and ammonia. LPG is a flammable gas shipped under pressure, while ammonia is a toxic gas. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the US handle LPG (propane) and ammonia as the top two hazardous cargoes. LPG is flammable and explosive, while ammonia is toxic. The list of ports is based on EPA/RMP hazardous cargo volumes and other key factors affecting terrorism risk in ports. Table 4 lists the top 30 ports handling EPA/RMP hazardous cargo in 2003, based on estimates of hazardous cargo volumes. Factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, port configuration, and threat intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program, which provides security enhancement grants to U.S. ports. These factors include hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, port configuration, and threat intelligence. For the FY2005 program, DHS evaluated 129 ports to identify 66 eligible for grants. The Department of Homeland Security evaluates ports for security grants based on various factors, including hazardous material shipments and passenger traffic. The Coast Guard is responsible for promoting maritime security and inspects commercial ships. The Coast Guard oversees security at hazardous material ports eligible for DHS grants to promote maritime security and inspect commercial ships. The Coast Guard monitors commercial ships entering U.S. waters for safety and security, especially those carrying hazardous cargo. Regulations are in place for the construction, operation, and transfer of hazardous cargo to prevent accidents and protect the marine environment. Compliance with these regulations is crucial for mitigating risks. The Coast Guard enforces safety regulations for ships carrying hazardous cargo to prevent accidents and protect the environment. Prior to 9/11, regulations focused more on safety than terrorism, with limited rules specifically addressing terrorist threats. After 9/11, the Coast Guard expanded maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety measures and security measures to prevent sabotage or subversive acts. Area maritime security committees, led by local captains of the port, play a key role in implementing these regulations. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded maritime security regulations to differentiate between safety and security measures. Area maritime security committees, led by local captains of the port, assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, evaluating susceptibility to terrorist activities and outlining resource allocation. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard, led by local captains of the port and chemical sector representatives, has assessed port vulnerabilities and created plans to address them. These plans evaluate marine targets' susceptibility to terrorist activities and outline resource deployment to prevent attacks, focusing on vessels, facilities, and other vital port infrastructure. The assessments have been used to enhance security of key marine assets. The Coast Guard assesses port vulnerabilities and plans resource deployment to prevent terrorist attacks on vessels, facilities, and other vital port infrastructure. These assessments enhance security of key marine assets and contribute to the development of maritime security standards. The Coast Guard plays a leading role in developing maritime security standards, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) to ensure the safe operation of ships and ports worldwide. The ISPS Code, implemented in 2004, requires ships and certain port facilities to have approved security plans. The ISPS Code, implemented in 2004, requires ships and port facilities worldwide to have approved security plans with operational and physical security measures for three threat levels. Security officers must ensure code implementation, deploy necessary equipment, and monitor access of people and cargo. Security plans must indicate operational and physical security measures for three threat levels (normal, medium, and high). Ships and ports must designate a security officer, deploy required security equipment, monitor access of people and cargo, and ensure security communications are available. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, under the MTSA and ISPS Code, conducting on-site inspections six months later. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, under the MTSA and ISPS Code, conducting on-site inspections six months later.

NOAA also provides emergency response capabilities for hazardous material incidents. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program, for first responders and emergency planners to quickly respond to accidents or attacks on hazardous chemical vessels. NOAA offers hazardous material emergency response capabilities through the CAMEO program, which includes chemical dispersion software models and a database with response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals. NOAA has also improved support to emergency planners and first responders by linking its operational air dispersion models. NOAA partners with the Coast Guard and the Office of Naval Intelligence to conduct risk assessments on hazardous chemicals stored or shipped through U.S. ports. NOAA also coordinates federal chemical emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. NOAA, along with the DHS, coordinates federal chemical emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center, providing custom products for dispersion modeling predictions. Industry groups and the Coast Guard, with input from the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee, promote the security of hazardous marine cargo. Assessment Center offers custom products for all-hazards dispersion modeling predictions and assessments. Industry groups promote security of hazardous marine cargo with input from the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC), which includes members from various sectors associated with marine transportation of hazardous materials. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo in October 2002. The Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) is an advisory group composed of members from different sectors related to marine transportation of hazardous materials. In 2002, CTAC established a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators (AWO) collaborated with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to develop a model vessel security plan to prevent potential terrorist attacks. The CTAC Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security was formed to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators, in collaboration with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers, developed a model vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute inspects and issues audit reports on the chemical industry's fleet. The plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry in the U.S. homeland security policy. The American Chemistry Council has issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry in the U.S. homeland security policy, prioritizing securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks on marine vessels and in ports. Despite new maritime security measures post-9/11, policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo may still need attention. The American Chemistry Council has issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry in the U.S. homeland security policy, prioritizing securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks on marine vessels and in ports. Despite new maritime security measures post-9/11, policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo may still need attention, including risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness. Terrorism risk is defined as the product of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with significant uncertainties across all three areas. Policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo, including risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness, may require further Congressional attention. Significant uncertainties exist in the threat posed by terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters, with experts debating the level of public concern regarding specific threats to hazardous chemicals. Uncertainties exist regarding the threat of terrorists targeting hazardous marine cargo in U.S. waters since 9/11. Some experts believe public concern about specific threats is overstated and should not hinder maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping. The basis of these conclusions is questioned due to the uncertainty of threat intelligence. Some experts believe public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemicals shipping is overstated and should not impede maritime trade. Others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping, but the basis of these conclusions is uncertain due to the shifting goals and methods of potential attackers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission notes that historical experience provides little guidance in estimating the probability of a terrorist attack on marine chemical hazards. Vulnerability and consequence analysis of these hazards also face significant uncertainties. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acknowledges the uncertainty in estimating the probability of a terrorist attack on marine chemical hazards. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels under the MTSA and ISPS codes, and NOAA is partnering with them to conduct risk assessments at U.S. ports. Despite these efforts, analysts still face uncertainties in vulnerability and consequence analysis. Some analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels are not well understood, despite Coast Guard activities and partnership with NOAA for risk assessments at U.S. ports. Public controversy over terrorist risks to LNG shipping is fueled by conflicting studies from government and private sectors. Recent public controversy surrounds the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels, particularly LNG shipping. Conflicting studies from government and private sectors have fueled this debate, with little public information available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks. The security sensitivity of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans complicates efforts to evaluate them, with little public information available on physical vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. The Cole and Limburg attacks highlight existing vulnerabilities in maritime security, especially regarding intentional release of hazardous chemicals. While vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are crucial for U.S. maritime security, their effectiveness for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequences, particularly for attacks impacting the general public. Federal officials may struggle to accurately assess the risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes. The value and effectiveness of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans for hazardous chemicals carriers in U.S. maritime security strategy may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequences, especially for attacks affecting the general public. Federal officials may find it challenging to accurately assess the risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty could help prioritize maritime security activities. The Coast Guard could enhance port security efforts by ensuring timely reception of relevant intelligence information from federal agencies, while security experts could further reduce risk uncertainty through research. Reducing risk uncertainty in assessing terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes can aid in prioritizing maritime security activities. The Coast Guard could focus on port security by receiving timely intelligence information, while security experts could analyze vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. Analyzing vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences can reduce risk uncertainty in assessing terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes. Standard models and methodologies, such as those maintained by NOAA and EPA, may be beneficial for such analyses. A federal role may be important to ensure methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, locations, and agencies. Concerns have been raised about the costs associated with hazardous marine cargo security and the potential diversion of resources from other government activities. The federal role in analyzing vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences for hazardous marine cargoes is important for methodological consistency. Concerns about costs and resource diversion have been raised by policy makers, although Coast Guard officials note that maritime security expenditures are part of their general mission. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard, with security activities growing from 4% to 34% of total resource hours in the two years following 9/11. Coast Guard resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could be used for other missions like boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with security activities increasing from 4% to 34% of total resource hours post-9/11. $2.2 billion was allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, a 6% rise from FY2005. Hazardous marine cargo security is funded from the general maritime security budget, not specified in the FY2006 DHS budget request. The President requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, a 6% increase from FY2005. Hazardous marine cargo security is funded from the general maritime security budget, not specified in the FY2006 DHS budget request. Additionally, the budget includes $11 million for new small response boats and crew to enhance operational presence and response posture, enforce security zones, and escort high interest vessels. The Coast Guard's FY2006 budget seeks an additional $11 million for general maritime security funding, including new response boats and crew. The budget also includes funds for a nationwide vessel monitoring system and increased surveillance of vessels by aircraft. State and local agencies are also seeking more funding for hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers which may cost up to $80,000 to secure each time. The FY2006 Coast Guard budget includes $5.7 million for a nationwide vessel monitoring system and $87.4 million for increased surveillance of vessels by aircraft. State and local agencies are also seeking more funding for hazardous marine cargo security, especially for LNG tankers, which may cost up to $80,000 to secure each time. This cost burden may force agencies to divert resources from other public services. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover these security costs. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover the costs of additional maritime security needed for their facilities, as LNG security costs may divert resources from other public services. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, but ambiguity in accounting and reliance on federal funding sources like DHS grants raise concerns. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, citing taxes already paid, while others are open to covering additional costs. Some government officials are concerned about LNG security costs despite the funding from DHS port security grants. Certain LNG companies are hesitant to pay more for public security, arguing that their taxes should cover it. However, some are willing to pay for extra security if it goes beyond the standard level covered by corporate tax payments. The security costs for LNG shipments may not reflect the costs for securing other hazardous marine cargo. New security technology, specific threat intelligence, and evolving threat assessments could impact security costs. Some are willing to pay for additional security beyond standard levels covered by taxes for hazardous marine cargo, as new technology and threat assessments may lower costs in the future. Public agencies may need to review cost-sharing mechanisms for securing hazardous cargo from terrorist attacks. The Coast Guard has implemented various security measures to protect hazardous chemicals. The Coast Guard has security measures in place to protect hazardous chemicals shipping, but the effectiveness of these measures is still uncertain. Questions arise about the efficiency of deploying security resources and evaluating security activities. Reviewing cost-sharing mechanisms for securing hazardous cargo from terrorist attacks may be necessary. The effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping by the Coast Guard is uncertain. Questions remain about the efficiency of deploying resources and evaluating security activities. Assessing progress in enhancing national security is challenging. The GAO has found challenges in evaluating the Coast Guard's security activities, particularly in defining performance measures and assessing progress in making the nation more secure. Concerns also exist about whether Coast Guard security adequately addresses terrorism risks in hazardous cargo shipping. The Coast Guard's seaport security actions lack performance measures to define and measure progress towards goals, especially in addressing terrorism risks in hazardous cargo shipping. There are uncertainties in assessing terrorism risks, such as the risk from ammonia tankers versus dirty bombs on container ships. The Coast Guard's internal maritime security plan identifies high-risk cargos and conducts operations to address these risks. The Coast Guard's internal maritime security plan identifies high-risk cargos and conducts operations to address these risks, but there are uncertainties in assessing terrorism risks associated with hazardous chemical vessels. Some question whether the level of Coast Guard security for hazardous chemicals vessels appropriately reflects their relative risk. Some question if Coast Guard security for hazardous chemical vessels reflects their relative risk, with concerns about varying levels of protection between ports. Some observers question the varying levels of protection for chemical shipments in different ports, which could lead to inadequate security in some areas. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of Coast Guard's security activities for hazardous marine cargoes. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is also a concern among security analysts. In overseeing the Coast Guard's security activities for hazardous marine cargoes, Congress may need to evaluate effectiveness. Concerns also exist regarding emergency response to marine chemical attacks, with potential for high casualties in densely populated areas. The Homeland Security Council's national planning scenario involves chemical cargo ships with potential for high casualties in densely populated areas, overwhelming emergency agencies and medical facilities. Toxic chemical attacks would require specialized emergency response and medical treatment. An attack involving toxic chemicals could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities, requiring specialized response teams and medical treatment. Salvaging a vessel damaged in such an attack would be challenging due to the chemical hazard. Emergency authorities near affected waterways should develop specific measures to handle chemical releases. Salvaging a vessel damaged in a chemical attack poses challenges due to the hazardous cargo. Emergency authorities near affected waterways should develop specific measures to handle chemical releases, with potential support from federal or private sector assistance. Emergency authorities near affected waterways should develop specific measures to handle chemical releases, with potential support from federal or private sector assistance such as the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program. Congress may also consider other sources of funding for marine chemicals emergency response plans. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides emergency response plan and cost-sharing provisions for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. The Transportation Equity Act of 2005 and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program are potential funding sources for marine chemicals emergency response plans. Congress may explore other funding options. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 offers a legislative model for emergency response plans for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to those stored at chemical plants, often passing near populated areas. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to quantities stored at large chemical plants and often pass near populated areas. These shipments may be attractive terrorist targets and could cause catastrophic injuries among the general public if successfully attacked. The MTSA gives the Coast Guard authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping to prevent potential terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic injuries among the public. Both government and industry have taken steps to improve maritime security of hazardous chemical cargo. The MTSA grants the Coast Guard authority over hazardous marine shipping security to prevent terrorist attacks. Efforts are ongoing to enhance security measures for hazardous chemical cargo, with Congress monitoring terrorism risk evaluation and resource sufficiency. Congress may raise questions about terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate the resources and effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemical cargo in marine shipping. Additionally, evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical hazards may be of interest to Congress. Congress may assess the effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemical cargo in marine shipping, including evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities. Bulk quantities of hazardous chemicals are present in marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land. Congress may evaluate the integration of U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security with the overall strategy to protect the public. Hazardous chemicals are found in marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land, posing a policy challenge in balancing security resources across different sectors. The policy challenge of balancing security resources across different sectors, including marine transportation, land transportation, and chemical facilities, is complicated by limited vulnerability and consequence information. This hinders the ability to compare terrorism risks for hazardous chemicals, making it difficult for security analysts to prioritize which assets to protect. Limited vulnerability and consequence information for marine transportation complicates the comparison of terrorism risk scenarios across sectors. Security analysts may struggle to prioritize which chemical assets to protect and how to allocate limited security resources effectively. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security could reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective. It is essential to review how security priorities and activities align to achieve common goals. Identifying which chemical assets to protect and how to allocate limited security resources effectively is a challenge. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security may reduce terror risk but increase overall risk. Reviewing security priorities and activities to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for Congress. The Army Corps of Engineers collects detailed marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center.

Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. The ACE waterborne commerce databases track vessel movements between U.S. and foreign ports by type and tonnage. Vessel operators are required by law to report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The databases were not designed for chemical-specific analysis but can still be utilized. The ACE waterborne commerce databases track vessel movements between U.S. and foreign ports by type and tonnage, with vessel operators required to report domestic waterborne commercial movements. While not designed for chemical-specific analysis, the databases can still be used for this purpose with limitations. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, which CRS believes are sufficiently accurate for inclusion. The ACE databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, using standardized commodity codes. These estimates are considered accurate for inclusion in the report, but should be viewed strictly as estimates with certain limitations and caveats. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes to estimate EPA/RMP cargo statistics. These estimates are considered accurate for inclusion in the report but should be viewed strictly as estimates with limitations and caveats regarding cargo classification inconsistencies. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes to estimate EPA/RMP cargo statistics, but inconsistencies exist with individual hazardous chemicals identified by CAS registry numbers. CRS has tried to address these inconsistencies by comparing WCSC and UN codes and consulting with experts. For example, LNG and LPG were initially classified under the same code (34000) but were separated using LNG trade data from the Department of Energy. CRS has attempted to correct inconsistencies in cargo statistics by comparing WCSC and UN codes and consulting with experts. For example, LNG and LPG were initially classified under the same code (34000) but were separated using LNG trade data from the Department of Energy. Some shipment estimates for EPA/RMP chemicals may include volumes of other chemicals not on the list. Cargo volumes for chemicals may be loaded or unloaded at multiple locations during a single shipment. The ACE data reports the movement of cargo at each point but cannot provide the total tonnage carried on a vessel at any time due to the vast amount of records in the waterborne commerce databases. The ACE data reports the movement of chemicals cargo at various locations during a single shipment, but cannot provide the total tonnage carried on a vessel at any time. The waterborne commerce databases contain millions of records, leading to potential errors in data classification and processing. The ACE employs a rigorous internal review process to minimize errors in data analysis and reporting. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with potential errors in data classification and processing. CRS identified inconsistencies in ACE estimates, which were corrected, but additional data quality-related errors may have gone unnoticed.
