Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program offer support for healthy snacks and milk in schools. Additionally, the Child and Adult Care Food Program provides meals and snacks in child care settings. The Child Nutrition Programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, offer food in institutional settings. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program funds snacks in elementary schools, while the Special Milk Program supports milk in schools not part of NSLP or SBP. Other programs like the Child and Adult Care Food Program provide meals in child care settings. These programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The Child Nutrition Programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, offer meals and snacks in institutional settings. The programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers started but did not finish reauthorizing child nutrition programs, which include the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. The programs have continued with funding from annual appropriations acts despite the expiration of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Both Senate and House committees reported reauthorization legislation. In the 114th Congress, reauthorization legislation for child nutrition programs was started but not completed. The legislation involved changes to permanent statutes such as the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act. Efforts for reauthorization died at the end of the Congress, with no significant progress in the 115th Congress. The child nutrition reauthorization legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) in the 114th Congress did not pass both chambers and expired. There were no significant efforts in the 115th Congress, but some provisions were included in the 2018 farm bill. These issues may be relevant for future reauthorization efforts. The 2018 farm bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs, raising issues for future reauthorization efforts. These issues pertain to the nutritional quality and sourcing of foods in schools, as well as access to summer meals and the Community Eligibility Provision. The 2018 farm bill raised issues for future reauthorization efforts related to child nutrition programs, including the nutritional quality of foods, sourcing, access to summer meals, and the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. The report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. The report does not cover every issue but highlights recent concerns raised by Congress and program stakeholders. This report offers an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, focusing on concerns raised by Congress and stakeholders. It references CRS reports for more detailed information and analysis on specific issues. References to CRS reports are provided for more detailed information on child nutrition programs, including School Meals Programs, child nutrition reauthorization proposals, and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA). School meals must meet specific nutritional requirements for federal reimbursement. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) required USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. These standards must be met for federal reimbursement. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) mandated USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, including vending machine snacks. The law required USDA to propose regulations for competitive foods within a year and for school meals within 18 months. It also provided increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new standards. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) mandated USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. The law required proposed regulations within specific timeframes and provided increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements. Various organizations and stakeholders supported the nutrition standards, which were largely detailed in subsequent regulations, not the HHFKA itself. The nutrition standards in the HHFKA were supported by various organizations and stakeholders, including advocacy groups, food companies, school officials, retired military leaders, and Michelle Obama. The specific requirements were outlined in subsequent regulations by USDA-FNS, based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations. The USDA-FNS published final rules for school meals and competitive foods in accordance with the HHFKA. The nutrition standards were based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations, increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins in meals. Milk options were restricted to low-fat and fat-free varieties. The updated standards for school meals increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and fat. Milk options were restricted to low-fat and fat-free varieties. Nutrition standards for competitive foods also limited calories, sodium, and fat, applying only to non-meal foods sold during the school day. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and fat. The standards applied to non-meal foods sold during the school day, with exceptions for fundraisers. Implementation began in school year 2012-2013 for meals and 2014-2015 for competitive foods, with phased-in sodium limits and whole grain requirements for school meals. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods were implemented starting in school year 2012-2013. Some schools faced challenges with the changes, such as difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. These challenges were reported by the School Nutrition Association and in news stories. Some schools faced challenges with implementing changes to school meal standards, including difficulty obtaining certain products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. These issues were reported by the School Nutrition Association and in news stories. Studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed these challenges in the first two years of implementation. In SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014, challenges were reported in implementing school meal standards. The School Nutrition Association advocated for changes, while others argued for maintaining the standards for children's health. USDA made adjustments in January 2014 and Congress loosened requirements in FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017. In January 2014, USDA removed weekly limits on grains and protein. Congress enacted provisions in FY2015-2017 that loosened milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements. USDA made similar changes for SY2018-2019, with a final rule in December 2018 indefinitely changing standards starting in SY2019-2020. This allows all SFAs to offer flavored, low-fat milk in school meals. USDA implemented changes for school meal standards from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. In December 2018, a final rule was published, allowing flavored, low-fat milk in school meals and beverages. SFAs must adhere to a 50% whole grain-rich requirement and maintain Target 1 sodium levels starting in SY2019-2020. The final rule published in December 2018 allows flavored, low-fat milk in school meals and beverages, alongside unflavored milk. SFAs must follow a 50% whole grain-rich requirement and maintain Target 1 sodium levels from SY2019-2020 through SY2023-2024, with Target 2 limits starting in SY2024-2025. Target 3 limits have been eliminated. The final rule published in December 2018 allows flavored, low-fat milk in school meals and beverages, alongside unflavored milk. The nutrition standards for school meals remain largely intact, with changes to milk requirements affecting other beverages sold in schools. Legislative proposals related to the nutrition standards were considered in the 115th Congress. The nutrition standards for school meals have remained largely intact, with changes to milk requirements also impacting other beverages sold in schools. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress, such as the House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill, aimed to review and revise these standards based on research for school-age children. The House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill in the 115th Congress aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals based on research for school-age children, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the House and Senate during the 114th Congress aimed to alter nutrition standards for school meals. The House committee's proposal (H.R. 5003) would have required USDA to review school meal standards every three years and revise them as needed. Additionally, fundraisers by student groups would no longer have had to meet competitive food standards. Congress proposed changes to nutrition standards for school meals. The House committee's proposal (H.R. 5003) required USDA to review standards every three years and make revisions as needed. Fundraisers by student groups would no longer need to meet competitive food standards. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) aimed to revise whole grain and sodium requirements within 90 days. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) aimed to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals. Negotiations resulted in an agreement to reduce the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay the sodium requirement for two years. Fruit and vegetable snacks served in FFVP must be fresh under current law. Negotiations between the Senate committee, the White House, USDA, and the School Nutrition Association led to an agreement to reduce the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay the sodium requirement for two years. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks are currently required in FFVP, with some advocating for the inclusion of frozen, dried, and canned options. Stakeholders include agricultural producers. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project to include canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. Stakeholders have differing opinions on whether to include non-fresh options in the program. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project to include canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. Schools in four states incorporated CDF fruits and vegetables due to difficulty obtaining fresh produce. 56% of pilot schools chose to include CDF fruits and vegetables during the demonstration, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings in the FFVP. According to the final evaluation in 2017, 56% of pilot schools incorporated canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. This led to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on snack days. Student participation and satisfaction with the program slightly decreased during the pilot. During the pilot of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, while fruit consumption declined on snack days. Student satisfaction with the program slightly decreased, and parents' responses were mixed. School administrators generally favored the changes, and legislative proposals have been considered to allow different forms of fruits and vegetables in the program. During the pilot of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, parents' responses were mixed, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals in Congress have been considered to allow different forms of fruits and vegetables in the program. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve canned or dried fruits and vegetables initially, transitioning to fresh products over time. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) would have provided temporary hardship exemptions for schools with limited storage and preparation facilities or limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables, allowing them to serve CDF fruits and vegetables in FFVP. Schools participating in NSLP and/or SBP must comply with federal requirements related to sourcing foods domestically under Buy American requirements. Schools in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and/or School Breakfast Program (SBP) must adhere to Buy American requirements, purchasing domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable, defined as those produced and processed substantially in the United States. USDA regulations require schools in the NSLP and/or SBP to purchase domestic commodities or products that are produced and processed substantially in the United States. The definition of \"processed substantially\" includes products processed in the U.S. with over 51% domestically grown ingredients, as outlined in USDA guidance for implementing Buy American requirements. The USDA regulations require schools in the NSLP and/or SBP to purchase domestic commodities or products that are processed substantially in the United States, with over 51% domestically grown ingredients. USDA guidance outlines the Buy American requirements for SFAs and state agencies, with the most recent guidance issued in a June 2017 memorandum. The Buy American requirements apply to any foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account, including children's paid lunch fees. The USDA guidance from June 2017 outlines Buy American requirements for SFAs, encouraging integration into procurement processes by monitoring the USDA catalog for products and including Buy American language in solicitations and contracts. SFAs can make exceptions to Buy American rules. The USDA guidance from June 2017 encourages SFAs to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes by monitoring the USDA catalog for products and including Buy American language in solicitations and contracts. SFAs can make exceptions to Buy American rules when necessary. The 2018 farm bill allows exceptions to Buy American requirements when U.S. products are not available or significantly more expensive. SFAs must document any exceptions made and can request waivers for non-compliant products. State agencies must ensure compliance and take corrective action when needed. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements and ensure understanding of responsibilities by SFAs and states within 180 days of enactment. USDA must also report to Congress on actions taken and plans for compliance. SFAs can request waivers for non-compliant products and state agencies must review compliance and take corrective action when necessary. The 2018 farm bill (Section 4207 of P.L. 115-334) mandates USDA to enforce Buy American requirements within 180 days, clarify domestic product definition, and report to Congress on compliance actions. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American requirements within 180 days and clarify the definition of domestic products for enforcement purposes. Domestic products are those processed in the U.S. and contain meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities produced in the U.S. or fish harvested in specific areas. The provision in the bill amended a related provision in the Senate-passed version. The enacted bill amended Buy American requirements for domestic sourcing of food products in the United States, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. Proponents argue for stricter requirements citing economic and food safety reasons, with concerns over sourcing from China. Others advocate for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement due to limited availability and cost-effectiveness of high-quality domestic options. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings for children. Some argue for stricter Buy American requirements for domestic food sourcing, citing economic and food safety concerns, particularly regarding China. Others advocate for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement due to limited availability and cost-effectiveness of high-quality domestic options. Summer meals are usually provided in group settings for children through programs like SFSP and SSO, with policymakers exploring alternatives in recent years, especially in rural areas. In recent years, policymakers have tested alternatives to congregate meals in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option (SSO), particularly focusing on rural areas. Reaching children in rural areas for summer meals has been reported as challenging, according to a May 2018 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $85 million for demonstration projects to improve access to summer meals in urban and rural areas. One project, the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), started in 2011 and continues annually. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated $85 million for demonstration projects to enhance access to summer meals for children in urban and rural areas. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project, initiated in 2011, provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. The benefits range from $30 to $60 per month on an EBT card for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program. The SEBTC project, started in 2011, offers electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive $30 to $60 per month on an EBT card for either WIC or SNAP. Benefits can be redeemed at authorized retailers. An evaluation of the Summer EBT program from FY2011 to FY2013 found a decrease in very low food security among participants, with 9.5% of control group children experiencing very low food security compared to 6.4% in the Summer EBT group. An evaluation of Summer EBT from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a significant decline in very low food security among participants, with improvements in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Funding for Summer EBT projects has been provided by Congress, with increased consumption seen at sites operating the WIC model. The Summer EBT program has shown improvements in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Funding has been provided by Congress for Summer EBT projects, with recent funding of $28 million in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for the program include various states and tribal nations. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $28 million for the Summer EBT demonstration. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included various states and tribal nations. USDA announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating from 2019 to 2021. In October 2018, USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for determining grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating from 2019 to 2021. Proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses aimed to expand Summer EBT, with the Senate committee's child nutrition reauthorization proposal in the 114th Congress allowing funding to cover Summer EBT and authorizing up to $50 million for the program. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, efforts were made to expand Summer EBT, with proposals allowing funding to cover the program and authorizing up to $50 million for it. The Obama Administration also recommended nationwide expansion of Summer EBT over 10 years. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was used for other demonstration projects, including the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP). The Obama Administration proposed expanding Summer EBT nationwide over 10 years. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was used for other projects, including the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) in eight states from 2010 to 2012. The eSFSP included incentives for SFSP sites to operate longer, funding for recreational or educational activities, meal delivery in rural areas, and food backpacks for children. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) ran from 2010 to 2012 in eight states, with initiatives to extend operations, add activities at meal sites, provide meal delivery in rural areas, and offer food backpacks for children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in the meal delivery and backpack programs. The eSFSP ran from 2010 to 2012 in eight states, with initiatives to extend operations, add activities at meal sites, provide meal delivery in rural areas, and offer food backpacks for children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in the meal delivery and backpack programs. Summer meal participation rates rose during the demonstration periods for all four initiatives, with caution needed in interpreting results due to small sample size and lack of comparison group. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allowed exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for SFSP and SSO outdoor meal sites during excessive heat since 2015. Exempted sites must still serve children in congregate settings on normal days and provide meals in alternative forms on hot days. USDA offers exemptions on a case-by-case basis. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allowed exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for SFSP and SSO outdoor meal sites during excessive heat since 2015. Exempted sites must continue to serve children in congregate settings on normal days and provide meals in alternative forms on hot days. USDA also offers exemptions on a case-by-case basis for extreme weather conditions. There have been other proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in SFSP in recent years. In recent years, there have been proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in SFSP. For example, in the 114th Congress, there were committee-reported child nutrition reauthorization proposals that would have allowed some rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for consumption offsite. These proposals aimed to enable offsite consumption for children in rural areas and in nonrural areas with a high percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The proposed bills (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) aimed to allow rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption, including in rural areas and nonrural areas with high percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The bills also allowed congregate feeding sites to provide meals for offsite consumption under certain conditions. The bills aimed to allow congregate feeding sites to provide meals for offsite consumption under certain conditions, such as extreme weather or public safety concerns. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to offer free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its introduction in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) offers free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its introduction in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. This accounts for roughly 22% of National School Lunch Program (NSLP) schools. Various groups support CEP, citing improved meal access, reduced stigma, and lower administrative costs. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) provides free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017, accounting for roughly 22% of NSLP schools. Some groups support CEP for improving meal access, reducing stigma, and lowering administrative costs, while others have sought to restrict schools' eligibility for CEP. In the 114th Congress, the House's committee-reported child nutrition reauthorization bill sought to restrict schools' eligibility for the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to target resources better. CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs, such as the Title I-A program, which uses free and reduced-price lunch data for eligibility and funding. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) has created data issues for other federal and state programs, like the Title I-A program, which uses free and reduced-price lunch data for eligibility and funding. The data from school meal applications, no longer collected under CEP's automatic eligibility process, determine eligibility and funding allocations. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, leading to issues of unpaid meal costs and schools trying to collect debts from families. In recent years, schools have faced increased attention regarding students owing meal costs and schools' responses. This includes serving regular meals and creating a debt, or resorting to \"lunch shaming\" practices such as taking away hot foods and providing cold meals, barring participation in events, or having children wear visual indicators of meal debt. Some schools practice \"lunch shaming\" by taking away hot meals from students with meal debt, providing cold alternatives, or imposing penalties until the debt is repaid. Limited national data is available on the prevalence of these practices, but many school districts struggle with unpaid meal costs. Many school districts struggle with unpaid meal costs, which create a financial burden on their meal programs. Schools rely on student payments for full and reduced-price meals as a primary revenue source. If schools are unable to recover unpaid meal funds, it can impact their operations. Schools face financial burdens from unpaid meal costs, impacting their meal programs. Federal funds and student payments are crucial revenue sources. Unpaid meal funds can become \"bad debt,\" requiring schools to cover costs with nonfederal funding. Congress and USDA have taken steps since 2010 to address this issue. Since 2010, Congress and USDA have addressed the issue of unpaid meal costs by requiring USDA to examine states' and school districts' policies on the matter. This includes preparing a report on establishing national standards for meal charges and alternate meals, with potential follow-up actions based on the findings. The USDA was required by Congress to review policies on unpaid meal charges, leading to a report in June 2016. The report did not recommend national standards but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to support decision-making by states and localities. USDA's Report to Congress in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices. USDA-FNS required SFAs to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, including instructions on handling situations where a child does not pay for a meal. Clarifications were provided through webinars, memoranda, and a best practice guide. USDA-FNS mandated SFAs to implement a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with guidelines on addressing unpaid meals. This was supported by webinars, memoranda, and a best practice guide. The recommendation was based on a study and a Request for Information (RFI) that highlighted the need for clear meal charge policies. The USDA recommended SFAs to implement a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, based on findings from a study and a Request for Information (RFI) on \"Unpaid Meal Charges.\" The study and RFI showed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. School officials expressed a preference for local control in the RFI comments. The meal charge policies were determined at the school and district levels, with varying formality and enforcement. School officials preferred local control, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, officials preferred local control of meal charge policies, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. The topics of lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also addressed, with legislative proposals such as the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 being introduced. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress, such as the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017, aimed to establish national standards for how schools treat children unable to pay for meals. States have also enacted legislation to address unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming. For example, in 2018, Illinois passed a law in this regard. The Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 (H.R. 2401/S. 1064) aimed to set national standards for how schools handle children unable to pay for meals. States have also passed laws addressing unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming, such as Illinois requiring schools to provide regular meals to students who cannot pay. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced new rules on schools' pricing of paid lunches. In 2018, Illinois passed legislation requiring schools to provide regular meals to students who cannot pay and allowing districts to request state assistance for debts over $500. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act introduced rules for schools to review and potentially increase prices for paid lunches, with the option to use nonfederal funding sources to meet requirements. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated schools in the NSLP to review and adjust paid lunch prices to ensure federal funds benefit children on free and reduced-price lunches. Prior to this, federal subsidies were supporting other meal program aspects, including paid lunches. The HHFKA mandated schools to adjust paid lunch prices to ensure federal funds benefit children on free and reduced-price lunches. A USDA study found federal subsidies were cross-subsidizing other meal program aspects, including paid lunches, due to all reimbursements being mixed into the same school food service account. Some argue that raising prices may reduce participation in paid lunches. The paid lunch equity formula requires the price per paid lunch to eventually match or exceed the difference. Some argue that raising prices for paid lunches may reduce participation. The paid lunch equity formula mandates prices to match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If schools do not meet this requirement, they must increase prices over time. For example, in SY2018-2019, federal reimbursements were $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches in some schools. The lunch prices must match or exceed the federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. Schools must gradually increase prices if they do not meet this requirement. For example, in SY2018-2019, federal reimbursements were $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches in some schools. Schools cannot raise prices by more than 10 cents annually to close the gap. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools to gradually increase lunch prices if they were below $3.00 per paid lunch. Revenue from nonprogram foods had to go to the school food authority, preventing it from being used for other purposes. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated that revenue from competitive foods must go to the school food authority, ensuring it is not used for other school purposes. USDA-FNS published a rule in June 2011 to implement these requirements, with some flexibility in the first year, and provided exemptions for certain school food authorities from SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. In June 2011, USDA-FNS implemented a rule requiring revenue from competitive foods to go to the school food authority. Exemptions were provided for certain school food authorities from SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. For SY2018-2019, SFAs with a negative balance in the NSFSA may have to raise prices for paid meals. The enacted FY2018 appropriation expanded exemptions for SFAs with negative NSFSA balances, potentially requiring price increases for paid meals. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses aimed to eliminate or replace paid lunch equity requirements. In recent Congresses, legislative proposals aimed to eliminate or replace paid lunch equity requirements, such as the House committee's proposal to eliminate the requirements and the Senate committee's proposal to replace them with a broader \"non-federal revenue target.\" The curr_chunk discusses various programs and acronyms related to school food services, such as CACFP, CDF, CEP, eSFSP, FFVP, HHFKA, NSFSA, NSLP, SBP, SFA, SFSP, SMP, SSO, Summer EBT, SY, and USDA-FNS. These programs are part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's efforts to provide meals to children in schools and childcare settings. The curr_chunk provides acronyms for various school food service programs such as NSFSA, NSLP, SBP, SFA, SFSP, SMP, SSO, and Summer EBT. These programs are part of the USDA-FNS efforts to provide meals to children in schools."
