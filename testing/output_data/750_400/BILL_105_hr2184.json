    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997\". Congress finds that private security officers in the United States are growing rapidly, function as an adjunct to public law enforcement, provide entry-level job opportunities, and protect individuals and property. Private security officers offer entry-level job opportunities for individuals affected by unemployment, protecting various properties and operations such as banks, hospitals, airports, and schools. Private security officers provide protection to a wide range of operations including banks, hospitals, chemical companies, airports, and residential properties. Sworn law enforcement officers serve the public in public areas, with private security officers supporting them by offering prevention and reporting services. The growth of private shopping malls has increased the demand for security services. Private security officers supplement sworn law enforcement officers in providing services to the public. With the rise of private shopping malls, people are more likely to interact with private security personnel than with sworn police officers. The growth of private shopping malls has led to a decrease in public shopping streets, resulting in more contact with private security personnel than sworn law enforcement officers. This trend has accelerated as the number of public sector law enforcement officers has decreased, with the goal of making more officers available to combat serious crimes. The trend towards growth in private security services has accelerated as the number of public law enforcement officers has decreased. This growth aims to provide more officers to combat serious crimes, as the public struggles to differentiate between sworn officers and private security personnel. The American public demands the employment of both. Private security personnel are needed to combat serious crimes, but the public has difficulty distinguishing them from sworn law enforcement officers. The American public demands the use of qualified private security personnel as a supplement, not a replacement for sworn officers. Private security officers should undergo thorough screening, especially since many carry weapons. SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.
