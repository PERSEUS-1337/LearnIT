The Alzheimer's Association estimates that over 60 percent of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will wander away from their care facilities. States like Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas have implemented notification systems similar to the Amber Alert to disseminate relevant information. States like Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas have established notification systems modeled after the Amber Alert to disseminate information about missing seniors and those with dementia-related illnesses to authorities quickly. States like Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas have implemented Silver Alert systems to notify law enforcement about missing seniors and individuals with dementia, increasing the chances of locating them. Some states have faced challenges in developing such systems due to budget constraints. Congress recognizes the importance of Silver Alert systems. Silver Alert systems in various states aim to increase the chances of locating missing seniors and individuals with dementia. Congress emphasizes the need for clear criteria in issuing alerts and cautions against age-based determinations. Other states have struggled with implementing similar systems due to budget limitations. The criteria for issuing Silver Alerts should be definitive to prevent frequent notifications and not based solely on the age of the missing individual. Alerts should only be for those unable to make personal care decisions and must be initiated by a designated person. The Silver Alert criteria specify that alerts are only for individuals incapable of making personal care decisions and must be initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing person and is a legal guardian, close family member, resident of the same household, or caregiver. The Silver Alert criteria require alerts for individuals unable to make personal care decisions, initiated by someone with recent contact who is a legal guardian, close family member, resident of the same household, or caregiver, to protect privacy and encourage training for law enforcement. The Silver Alert criteria emphasize protecting the privacy and dignity of individuals, promoting training for law enforcement on locating missing individuals with dementia-related illnesses, and effective communication with them. The Federal Government can assist in locating missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses, determining if someone has a dementia-related illness, and improving communication with them. Coordination between State and local entities is encouraged for the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program. The Federal Government can help prevent injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease by supporting States in establishing and improving Silver Alert systems. Coordination between State and local entities is encouraged for the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program. The Silver Alert System Grant Program is established to support States in improving systems for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Coordination between State and local entities is encouraged for the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program. The Attorney General can award grants to States to establish or improve Silver Alert systems. Grants are for a one-year period and must be at least $100,000.
