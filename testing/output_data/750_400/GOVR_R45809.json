    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from loss or disruption of CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) on critical infrastructure protection, issued in 1998, was the first significant policy in this area. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, framing the issue in terms of national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. It emphasized the interdependence of U.S. military, economic, and national power. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), released in 1998, framed critical infrastructure protection as essential for national security against asymmetric attacks. It defined critical infrastructure as systems necessary for the economy and government to function. PDD-63 set ambitious goals to eliminate national vulnerability. The directive PDD-63 defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, setting ambitious goals to eliminate national vulnerability to cyber or physical attacks. Establishing consistent criteria for assessing critical assets has proven challenging due to the complex nature of criticality. The challenge of assessing critical infrastructure vulnerability to asymmetric cyber or physical attacks lies in the difficulty of establishing consistent criteria due to the complex nature of criticality. The scale, complexity, and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies further complicate efforts to identify and inventory critical assets and systems. The U.S. and global economies' scale, complexity, and interconnectedness complicate efforts to identify critical assets and systems, such as the electricity sub-sector with nearly 7,000 power plants. The focus is on protecting industrial and demographic foundations against attacks. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets that, if incapacitated or destroyed, would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety. The USA PATRIOT Act defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets essential to national security, economic security, public health, or safety. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include provision of essential services and conveniences to the public, expanding beyond physical foundations of national power. Threats to critical infrastructure are a focus for Congress and executive branch agencies. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include provision of essential services and conveniences to the public, expanding beyond physical foundations of national power. The universe of threats to critical infrastructure considered by Congress and executive branch agencies has also expanded, with a focus on asymmetric threats posed by state and non-state adversaries. The intelligence community is increasingly focused on asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure, including attacks using physical or cyber means to disrupt systems and assets. Natural disasters and other non-terrorism related causes of damage have also become significant concerns in critical infrastructure policy. Asymmetric attacks using physical or cyber means can damage domestic critical infrastructure systems and assets, causing mass civilian casualties. The definition of critical infrastructure has expanded to include events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government, beyond just catastrophic events. In the years since 9/11, infrastructure policy has evolved to include events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government, reflecting a society-centric perspective that emphasizes infrastructure as vital for prosperity, public safety, and civic life. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) published by DHS in 2013 serves as official policy guidance for interagency coordination and public-private partnerships. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), published by DHS in 2013, defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that underpin American society, considering impacts of natural and manmade hazards at various levels. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that underpin American society, considering impacts of natural and manmade hazards at various levels. Successive Administrations have expanded CI policy to focus on society-centric resilience at the system level. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, including physical locations and technology. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, including physical locations and technology infrastructure such as voter registration databases and voting systems. These systems are essential for supporting the nation's civic life. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems, including physical locations and technology infrastructure, as critical infrastructure. This designation is based on their essential role in supporting the nation's civic life. The federal government uses 16 critical infrastructure sectors outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21 for public-private partnerships. DHS coordinates partnership programs, with other federal agencies leading as Sector-Specific Agencies. The private sector's role is discussed in the report's final section. The private sector plays a key role in partnership programs for critical infrastructure sectors, with DHS coordinating activities and other federal agencies leading as Sector-Specific Agencies. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress. The private sector is a key player in critical infrastructure sectors, with formal coordination bodies representing each sector. These bodies include private sector stakeholders, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as industry and non-profit groups participating in sector-wide activities. As sectors evolve, new public and private sector communities of interest emerge. The critical infrastructure sector is represented by formal coordination bodies involving private sector stakeholders, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as industry and non-profit groups. New public and private sector communities of interest emerge as sectors mature, each with its unique perspective on criticality. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure despite the commonly cited statutory definition remaining unchanged for nearly two decades. Sector communities of interest within critical infrastructure have diverse perspectives on what criticality means, leading to a lack of a consistent definition. The identification and prioritization of critical systems reflect evolving interests and perspectives, indicating that definitions of critical infrastructure are not just semantics. Multiple official definitions are in common use, highlighting the complexity of the concept. The definition of critical infrastructure has not changed in nearly two decades, reflecting diverse interests and perspectives. The multiplicity of official definitions in use is a result of negotiations among various constituencies regarding congressional responsibility, government programs, and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure policy has two distinct orientations. Critical infrastructure policy has two distinct orientations that overlap but reflect different organizational perspectives and requirements. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying, prioritizing, and protecting infrastructure assets based on the consequences of asset loss or system disruption. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) emphasizes identifying, prioritizing, and protecting infrastructure assets based on the consequences of asset loss or system disruption. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) focuses on broad investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness during steady-state periods, and adaptation during emergencies. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness to ensure availability of critical infrastructure functions during emergencies. Major legislation for CI policy was passed post-9/11 attacks, focusing on physical protection of critical assets. The foundation for critical infrastructure policy was established post-9/11 attacks, initially focusing on physical asset protection. However, there has been a shift towards emphasizing system resilience over asset protection in national policy, creating a hybrid approach that combines elements of both critical asset protection and system resilience. This shift can complicate the definition of criticality and identifying what is truly critical in the context of infrastructure resilience. The United States and other developed countries have shifted towards system resilience in national critical infrastructure policy, combining elements of asset protection and resilience. This hybrid approach complicates defining criticality and identifying critical infrastructure. The term \"critical infrastructure security\" is used in this report to discuss policy without favoring either approach. Legislation and government directives post-2001 often require asset lists and databases to identify critical assets. The report discusses \"critical infrastructure security\" in the context of CI policy, focusing on the need to identify and protect systems and assets of high criticality against potential threats. Legislation post-2001 often mandates the creation of asset lists and databases to determine critical assets. The report emphasizes the importance of identifying and protecting critical systems and assets against potential threats. Legislation post-2001 mandates the creation of asset lists and databases to determine critical assets that require higher levels of protection. Inventory requirements are the first step in broader risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. Inventory requirements are crucial for identifying and prioritizing critical assets in various sectors. Defining criticality criteria remains a topic of debate, but decisions on asset lists help determine which assets are considered critical. The National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure Protection is an early example of such inventory requirements. The National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure Protection, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities, systems, and functions at the enterprise level. This strategy aimed to define specific assets considered critical in practice. The National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure Protection, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities, systems, and functions at the national level. This led to the creation of a comprehensive database cataloging these critical assets. This strategy was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which laid the foundation for critical infrastructure policy development and implementation for the next decade. The National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure Protection in February 2003 directed the development of a database cataloging critical facilities, systems, and functions. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which served as the basis for critical infrastructure policy development until superseded by PPD-21 in 2013. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directed federal departments to protect critical infrastructure and key resources. DHS claimed to have a comprehensive database in the 2006 NIPP, but a DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the CI asset database. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the Department's National Asset Database, which had rapidly grown to include 77,069 assets, ranging from nuclear power plants to local petting zoos and water parks. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report identified issues with the National Asset Database, which had expanded to 77,069 assets including a wide range of facilities. The report highlighted conceptual and methodological flaws, noting entries of questionable criticality and inconsistent data collection procedures. Examples included San Francisco listing its light rail system as one asset, while New York City listed subway stations as separate assets. The National Asset Database had issues with entries listing unusual assets without assurance of critical ones being included. Data collection procedures were not standardized, leading to discrepancies like San Francisco listing its light rail system as one asset, while New York City listed subway stations separately. Congress later mandated the creation of a national database of vital assets through the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated the creation of a National Asset Database, including a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure to be updated annually and submitted to Congress. The list includes assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated the creation of a National Asset Database with a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure, to be updated annually and submitted to Congress. The list includes assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed. The Secretary must implement quality control procedures to ensure asset nominations meet criticality thresholds. The 2013 GAO report highlighted improvements in DHS processes for identifying critical assets but raised concerns about criteria and methodology changes in the NCIPP after 2009. The 2013 GAO report raised concerns about changes in criteria and methodology in the NCIPP after 2009, specifically regarding the assessment of criticality based on potential adverse consequences. After 2009, NCIPP assessed criticality of nominations based on potential adverse consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique CI characteristics, such as the collapse of the U.S. financial system. Election infrastructure was added as a CI sub-sector in 2017. The report highlighted the importance of vetting methods for asset nominations. The collapse of the U.S. financial system could have severe second-order effects on national security, economic security, and public health and safety. The report recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods for election infrastructure added to the CI sub-sector in 2017. Being listed as a prioritized asset in the NCIPP elevates its national significance under relevant statutes. The DHS recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods for the NCIPP list to ensure the identification of the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Being listed as a prioritized asset in the NCIPP elevates its national significance under relevant statutes, impacting various government activities. The exact number of nominated assets is classified. The NCIPP list identifies assets of national significance under relevant statutes, impacting government activities such as risk assessments, regulatory regimes, and emergency response coordination. The exact number of nominated assets is classified, but they number in the thousands. Some state governments have opted not to participate in DHS data calls due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. The NCIPP list contains thousands of assets of national significance, but some state governments choose not to participate in DHS data calls due to various reasons. This leads to the list not being a complete national inventory of critical systems and assets. The NCIPP list is not a complete national inventory of critical systems and assets due to states lacking expertise in developing scenarios and modeling infrastructure systems. DHS was also found to be non-compliant with the statutory annual reporting requirement, indicating persistent difficulties in ensuring the completeness and quality of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The lack of documentation compliance with the statutory annual reporting requirement indicates persistent difficulties in ensuring the completeness and quality of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems, expanding data collection to include all assets within a sector for emergency planning. CI assets needing protected status. CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for service continuity during stress on infrastructure systems. This approach expands data collection to include all assets within a sector for emergency planning and contingency situations, regardless of their inclusion on a specific list. The data can be used to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services if usual systems are compromised. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a major CI interagency database that compiles data from public and private sector partners. It is used to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services during contingency situations. The lead agencies involved in this database are DHS, Department of Defense (DOD), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a database compiled by lead agencies such as DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey. It contains hundreds of data layers curated by designated partner agencies, providing critical assets for homeland security functions to eligible organizations at all government levels. HIFLD is a database with data layers curated by partner agencies, containing critical assets for homeland security functions. These assets include lifeline CI functions like energy, communications, transportation, and water systems, as well as other categories that may become critical in specific emergencies or policy decisions. HIFLD includes asset categories essential for supporting lifeline critical infrastructure functions such as energy, communications, transportation, and water systems. It also contains assets that may not be critical by standard definitions but could become critical in specific emergencies or policy decisions. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services used HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which may not be considered critical under common statutory definitions of critical infrastructure. The Department of Health and Human Services used the HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which may not be considered critical infrastructure but were essential for providing critical public health services in disaster zones. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for real-world use cases, enabling relevant agencies to address critical public health services in disaster zones. Unlike the NCIPP list, it does not prioritize specific systems and assets. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for real-world use cases to address public health services in disaster zones, without prioritizing specific systems and assets like the NCIPP list. It is widely used for preparedness and incident management activities by federal and SLTT agencies, contrasting with the declining state participation in NCIPP. The HIFLD partnership model supports federal oversight, regulation, and administration by providing infrastructure data for real-world use cases. It is also utilized for preparedness and incident management activities by federal and SLTT agencies. Despite declining state participation in NCIPP, CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, as seen in provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act related to national preparedness against electromagnetic threats and hazards. State participation in NCIPP has been documented by GAO. CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, as seen in provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act related to national preparedness against electromagnetic threats and hazards. Chemical manufacturing facilities posing a high risk for malicious exploitation are subject to DHS inspection and regulatory enforcement under CFATS. The DHS continues to inspect and enforce regulations on chemical manufacturing facilities at high risk for malicious exploitation under CFATS. Policy shifts towards system-level resilience may impact legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list. The policy shift towards system-level resilience may impact legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list, potentially reducing its profile. Congress should consider stakeholder participation costs, data gathering efficiency, and updates to National Asset Database requirements. Congress may need to consider the frequency of data calls, elimination of overlapping efforts, and updates to National Asset Database requirements to support data gathering and analysis for CI risk management. This is part of a larger national effort to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets. Efforts are being made to review Asset Database requirements in the 9/11 Commission Act to ensure their relevance to emerging CISA programs and alignment with other congressional programs like the Homeland Security Grant Program. This is part of a national effort to understand and assess homeland security risks, with Congress seeking authoritative assessments for CI risk management and resource allocation decisions. The national effort to understand and assess homeland security risks includes authoritative assessments sought by Congress for critical infrastructure risk management. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation decisions, congressional appropriations, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, federal grant funding, and security measures by infrastructure owner-operators. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes resulting from incidents, events, or occurrences. DHS oversees national infrastructure security efforts, defining risk as potential unwanted outcomes from incidents. Risk components include threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with threat defined as potential harm to life, information, operations, environment, or property. DHS considers threat, vulnerability, and consequence as components of risk, with threat defined as potential harm to various aspects. Threat assessments involve data on human adversaries or natural hazards, with estimates based on information about threat actors, their motivations, capabilities, and targets. Threat assessments include data on human adversaries or natural hazards, estimating threat based on information about threat actors, motivations, capabilities, and targets. Vulnerability is defined as a feature that renders an entity susceptible to harm. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard, incorporating likelihood and severity of event occurrence. DHS defines vulnerability as the \"physical feature or operational attribute that renders an entity, asset, system, network, or geographic area open to exploitation or susceptible to a given hazard.\" Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard. Assessments may contain recommendations for adoption of resilience measures to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. DHS defines consequence as the \"effect of an event, incident, or occurrence.\" Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt or destroy infrastructure. The curr_chunk discusses the use of various assessment methods to inform infrastructure security investments and activities. Research centers, universities, and industry groups develop modeling methodologies for this purpose. Infrastructure security assessments utilize technical and non-technical methods to evaluate and protect infrastructure systems and assets. Various modeling methodologies are developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups to guide security investments. Additionally, experts and officials use their knowledge and experience to make assessments. Consequence-based criticality assessments, when combined with threat and vulnerability assessments, help inform risk assessments. Since 2007, DHS has integrated these risk elements into its planning, programs, and budget. Since 2007, DHS has integrated consequence-based criticality assessments into its planning, programs, and budget activities to inform risk assessments. Critics challenge the formula R=f(TVC) as DHS struggles to assign probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks. Critics challenge the formula R=f(TVC) used by DHS in risk assessments, citing difficulties in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and the complex interactions between threat, vulnerability, and consequences. The formula R=f(TVC) used by DHS in risk assessments faces challenges in assigning probabilities to rare events and dealing with complex interactions between threat, vulnerability, and consequences. DHS recognized the need for a complete systemic risk picture for critical infrastructure in 2018 and proposed revisions to risk assessment approaches. Legislative and executive branch initiatives in 2018-2019 aimed to establish the basis for significant changes in CI risk assessment. The DHS recognized the need for a complete systemic risk picture for critical infrastructure in 2018 and proposed revisions to risk assessment approaches. Legislative and executive branch initiatives in 2018-2019 aimed to establish the basis for significant changes in CI risk assessment, including the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as an operational component of DHS. The CISA Act of 2018 created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to manage national critical infrastructure (CI) risk through the National Risk Management Center (NRMC), focusing on cross-sector analysis. The creation of the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) by CISA elevates infrastructure security as a policy focus. The NRMC adopts an evolved approach to CI risk management, emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented prioritization. Congress may request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. The National Risk Management Center (NRMC) by CISA focuses on infrastructure security with cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented prioritization. Congress may request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. The Homeland Security Act specifies how the Secretary of Homeland Security may leverage organizational resources for homeland security. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to utilize resources from university-based DHS Centers of Excellence, research centers, industry groups, and the Homeland Security Advisory Council for infrastructure risk assessment. Congress can set funding priorities for these organizations to support national critical infrastructure security goals. Federal organization addressing critical infrastructure issues has evolved in response to changing threats and homeland security maturity. The federal organization addressing critical infrastructure (CI) issues has evolved in response to changing threats and the maturation of the homeland security enterprise. Three distinct periods of development are covered: the initial policy development in the late 1990s, the post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the ongoing transition to the all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure. Federal attention to critical infrastructure (CI) policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about potential malicious exploitation of technology and physical infrastructure. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address these issues. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address concerns about cyber threats to national infrastructures. This led to the issuance of PDD-63, which aimed to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures to non-traditional cyber or physical threats. The Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. Two years later, PDD-63 was issued to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures to non-traditional cyber or physical attacks. The directive focused on increasing interagency coordination through the creation of the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism. The Gilmore Commission was chartered by Congress in 1999 to assess terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63, which aimed to address vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures to non-traditional cyber or physical attacks. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism, created by the directive, focused on interagency coordination but did not report directly to the President. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, assessed terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. The report found that PDD-63 implementation was incomplete, and the CIP enterprise had developed sporadically since 1998. Specifically, it highlighted the role of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). The Gilmore Commission's report in December 2000, titled \"Toward a National Strategy for Combating Terrorism,\" highlighted incomplete implementation of PDD-63 and the underdeveloped state of the CIP enterprise. It noted that ISACs were still in early stages, and the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism lacked sufficient authority and resources. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) was still in early stages with limited concrete actions taken to establish its basic functions under Federal authority. No overall national Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) strategy existed to guide government actions, and the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism lacked program and budget authority. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) lacked program and budget authority and had taken few concrete actions to establish its basic functions under FBI auspices. The 9/11 attacks had a galvanizing effect on homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection, leading to urgent national concerns and legislative actions. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national concerns and legislative actions to enhance homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection. One proposed option was to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security under statute with additional budget authorities and oversight requirements. The 9/11 attacks led to proposals for enhancing homeland security policy. One option was to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security under statute with added budget authorities and oversight requirements. Another option was to consolidate government counterterrorism functions under a new agency named the National Homeland Security Agency. The 9/11 attacks prompted proposals for enhancing homeland security policy. One option was to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security with increased budget authorities and oversight requirements. Another option was to consolidate government counterterrorism functions under a new agency called the National Homeland Security Agency, following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission. The National Homeland Security Agency was established following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission to consolidate counterterrorism functions and improve interagency coordination. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected this approach. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected the Hart-Rudman Commission's recommendations for consolidating counterterrorism functions and improving interagency coordination by transferring infrastructure security functions to DHS. The Homeland Security Act P.L. 107-296 transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors like business, finance, commerce, energy, public health, agriculture, and environmental protection. GAO identified the creation of DHS as high risk in 2003 due to the challenges of managing the transfer of numerous agencies. DHS integrated nearly three dozen federal agencies and entities into four major directorates. The creation of DHS in 2003 was designated as high risk due to the challenges of transferring numerous agencies. DHS incorporated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates, prioritizing homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism. The creation of DHS in 2003 involved merging numerous agencies into four major directorates, focusing on homeland security missions, particularly counterterrorism. This marked a shift in infrastructure policy, with CIP now seen as closely related to government's counterterrorism functions. The White House's view on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) changed post-9/11, with CIP now considered closely related to counterterrorism efforts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) highlighted in a report to Congress that CIP is a separate but related mission, citing diverse infrastructure risks beyond terrorism. The authors justified the distinction between Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and counterterrorism efforts, citing diverse infrastructure risks beyond terrorism. CIP funding overlapping counterterrorism was minimal, less than half a percent of the total CIP funding requested for the 2002 fiscal year. The 2001 report showed that CIP funding overlapping counterterrorism was minimal, less than half a percent of the total funding requested for 2002. However, after 9/11, infrastructure programs not previously seen as impacting counterterrorism were included in budget reports, reflecting increased focus on counterterrorism priorities for FY2004. The 2003 OMB report to Congress highlighted infrastructure programs now seen as directly impacting counterterrorism efforts. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase over pre-9/11 levels, including 28 federal entities outside DHS. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase over pre-9/11 levels, including 28 federal entities outside DHS, reflecting the newfound centrality of counterterrorism priorities in infrastructure-related programs. CIP had largely been redefined as a counterterrorism mission, leading to the creation of a new purpose-built department to ensure core homeland security missions. The creation of a new purpose-built department consolidated functions to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions under unified leadership. More than half of pre-9/11 homeland security funding was transferred to a single agency, with independent agencies within DHS retaining significant operational independence. The consolidation of functions under unified leadership institutionalized CIP and other homeland security missions. More than half of pre-9/11 funding was transferred to a single agency, while independent agencies within DHS retained operational independence. Despite significant changes, CIP remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Despite significant changes, critical infrastructure protection (CIP) remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. The threat of terrorism was a focal point for CIP policy, but public perception had softened by the time Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. By 2005, public perception of the terrorist threat had significantly softened, with only 6%-8% of Americans considering it a top concern, down from 46% immediately after 9/11. This trend has continued, with occasional spikes due to high-profile incidents. Public perception of the terrorist threat in the United States significantly decreased after 9/11, with only 6%-8% of Americans considering it a top concern by 2005. This trend has continued, with occasional spikes in concern due to high-profile incidents. In early 2019, terrorism did not garner enough responses to be listed as a category of public concern in Gallup surveys. The failure of the levy system during Hurricane Katrina also highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to diverse hazards beyond terrorism. After Hurricane Katrina, the failure of the levy system in New Orleans highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to various hazards beyond terrorism. Issues such as equipment failure, human error, weather disasters, and criminal activity became national policy concerns. In 2006, the Critical Infrastructure Task Force of the Homeland Security Advisory Council initiated a public policy debate on government's critical infrastructure. In 2006, the Critical Infrastructure Task Force of the Homeland Security Advisory Council raised concerns about the government's focus on protecting assets from terrorist attacks rather than improving resilience against various threats. Defensive posture was deemed \"brittle\" as not all targets could be protected and adversaries could find ways to defeat defenses. The government's critical infrastructure policies were criticized for focusing too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks and not enough on improving resilience against various threats. The Task Force argued that this defensive posture was \"brittle\" and not all targets could be protected. In 2008, the House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings addressing resilience, where DHS officials defended government policies promoting resilience alongside protection. In 2008, the House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on resilience, with DHS officials arguing for government policies promoting resilience alongside protection. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the diversity of missions and stakeholders in the expansive enterprise. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review emphasized the importance of resilience in facing a variety of threats and hazards, including natural disasters and cyberattacks. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the importance of resilience in addressing various threats and hazards, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational criminal activities, and contagious diseases. It emphasized the decentralized nature of homeland security, with diverse stakeholders sharing the responsibility for managing risks to critical infrastructure and other missions related to immigration, border security, cybersecurity, and disaster response. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the importance of resilience in addressing various threats and hazards, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational criminal activities, and contagious diseases. It emphasized the decentralized nature of homeland security, with diverse stakeholders sharing the responsibility for managing risks to critical infrastructure and other missions related to immigration, border security, cybersecurity, and disaster response. PPD-21 superseded HSPD-7 in 2013, informing the development of federal infrastructure protection policies. The 2013 PPD-21 superseded HSPD-7, emphasizing all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience over physical asset protection against terrorist threats. It highlighted the importance of secure and resilient critical infrastructure in national disaster preparedness efforts. The 2013 NIPP emphasized all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience over physical asset protection against terrorist threats. It stated that critical infrastructure must be secure, able to withstand and rapidly recover from all hazards, and require integration with the national preparedness system. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors such as aging and neglect of critical systems and assets. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors such as aging and neglect of critical systems and assets, beyond terrorism-related threats. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017 as required by the Homeland Security Act, leaving no current departmental-level statement specifying DHS strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security. The neglect of critical systems and assets has turned issues of investment, maintenance, and utility service provision into homeland security concerns. The lack of a 2017 QHSR submission to Congress by DHS means there is no current departmental-level statement outlining strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security or other homeland security goals. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security and the definition of critical infrastructure itself are still being negotiated among various stakeholders. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security and the definition of critical infrastructure itself are still being negotiated among Congress, executive branch departments, SLTT jurisdictions, and private-sector stakeholders. For example, in 2002, Congress directed the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns about terrorist threats to the food and agriculture sector. In 2002, Congress directed the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns about terrorist threats to the food and agriculture sector. However, in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility back to USDA from DHS, as proposed by the White House in its FY2019 budget request. The authorized transfer of a replacement facility and its functions back to USDA from the DHS Science and Technology Directorate under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, as proposed by the White House in its FY2019 budget request, reflects the evolution of critical infrastructure security in the federal government towards a distributed enterprise model emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to consider the proper allocation of critical infrastructure security responsibilities within the homeland security enterprise. The federal government's security has evolved into a distributed enterprise model emphasizing an all-hazards approach to critical infrastructure security. Congress may need to determine which aspects of critical infrastructure security fall under homeland security and which relate to commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. This model potentially blurs the boundaries between homeland security and other infrastructure policy dimensions. The distributed enterprise model of critical infrastructure security blurs boundaries between homeland security and other infrastructure policy dimensions. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. A more current strategy could define Departmental goals more clearly. The definition of homeland security is evolving beyond counterterrorism roots. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. A more current strategy could clarify Departmental goals and activities related to critical infrastructure security. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy is evident in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) indicates Congressional interest in homeland security strategy. The proposed act would require DHS to consult with advisory committees when developing its strategy and link it more directly with budgeting and program management. The Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives and is now with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It requires DHS to consult with advisory committees for its strategy and align it with budgeting and program management. Congress has periodically defined organizational relationships within DHS. The Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives and is now with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It requires DHS to consult with advisory committees for its strategy and align it with budgeting, program management, and prioritization. Congress has periodically acted to define organizational relationships within DHS, transitioning from a centralized to a more federated structure emphasizing operational components. The centralized directorate structure under headquarters management in DHS has shifted to a more federated structure, emphasizing the operational role of its components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS through the 2018 CISA Act. Congress may consider the level of centralization or federation that best supports critical infrastructure security. The 2018 CISA Act made the National Protection and Programs Directorate an agency within DHS, focusing on infrastructure partnership programs. Congress may need to assess the organizational structure within DHS to determine the best approach for critical infrastructure security. The management of critical infrastructure risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment poses ongoing policy challenges. Policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for critical infrastructure security. The management of critical infrastructure risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment presents enduring policy challenges. Policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for critical infrastructure security, which relies on voluntary collaboration between the public and private sectors to guide investment in security. Under this model, CI owner-operators have ultimate responsibility for assessing and mitigating risk at the enterprise level. Congress has directed executive branch agencies to assess and manage risk. The management of critical infrastructure risk involves voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors for security investment. CI owner-operators are responsible for assessing and mitigating risk at the enterprise level, while Congress directs executive branch agencies to manage risk at the national level. Infrastructure risk management is a collaborative effort reliant on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary security investments in the private sector. The partnership structure between government and private sectors involves collaborative efforts to assess and manage critical infrastructure risk at the national level. This framework relies on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security to address serious risks collectively. Private individuals or entities primarily handle investments in critical infrastructure security, but the public and larger business community share the most significant risks. The partnership structure between government and private sectors involves collaborative efforts to assess and manage critical infrastructure risk at the national level. While businesses, government, and society share a \"clear and shared interest\" in CI resilience, determining responsibility for upfront costs of investment and regulatory oversight measures can be challenging at the policy level. At the societal level, managing critical infrastructure (CI) risk involves determining responsibility for upfront costs of investment and regulatory oversight measures. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop CI risk management strategies voluntarily to support national resilience goals. The federal government encourages the private sector to develop CI risk management strategies and invest in national resilience goals through public-private partnerships. Government efforts in this area have varied in effectiveness, especially for risks that are diffuse and involve low-probability/high-consequence events. In practice, government efforts to encourage voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships have varied in extent and effectiveness, particularly for risks like major terrorist attacks or earthquakes. Industry participation incentives include improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and exceeding private companies' capabilities. The main incentives for industry participation in infrastructure resilience efforts include improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. Congress has taken steps to facilitate information sharing between the public and private sectors through the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 aims to reduce barriers to information sharing between public and private sectors, ensuring confidentiality of industry information shared with DHS under the PCII program. Public-private coordination councils provide a platform for policy discussions. The OECD report in 2019 highlighted that voluntary information sharing partnerships may not provide enough incentive for investments in resilience. Developed countries often combine voluntary policies with regulatory mandates to encourage resilience investments. The OECD report in 2019 found that voluntary information sharing and collaboration partnerships in advanced industrialized economies do not always ensure sufficient investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are often used in critical infrastructure sectors where incident impacts could be catastrophic, such as nuclear meltdowns or terrorist attacks involving chemicals. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic incident impacts, such as nuclear meltdowns or terrorist attacks involving chemicals. Collaborative approaches are more common as risks become more privatized, and policymakers aim to limit government regulatory reach in CI security. According to an academic survey, public-private partnerships for critical infrastructure security often involve collaborative approaches as risks become more privatized. Policymakers have aimed to limit government regulation in this area, as seen in PDD-63 and the creation of DHS with narrow regulatory mandates. The Transportation Security Administration has regulatory authority but does not always exercise it. PDD-63 emphasizes avoiding increased government regulation and unfunded mandates in the private sector. DHS, created by the Homeland Security Act, has broad responsibilities but limited regulatory mandates. TSA oversees oil and gas pipeline security but does not always regulate it. The Coast Guard regulates port security, a duty predating its transfer to DHS. CISA directly regulates certain chemical facilities to prevent terrorism. The Coast Guard regulates port security, CISA directly regulates certain chemical facilities to prevent terrorism, and TSA oversees oil and gas pipeline security without always regulating it. Other agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission also have regulatory authority related to infrastructure security. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates civilian nuclear facilities to enforce safety and reporting requirements, stemming from the Three Mile Island incident in 1979. These regulations focus on industrial safety and reliability, rather than specific homeland security measures like facility protection against deliberate attacks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforces safety and reporting requirements for civilian nuclear facilities, stemming from the Three Mile Island incident in 1979. Infrastructure security relevant to homeland security, such as protection against deliberate attacks, is overseen by the NRC, not DHS. Lessons from past experiences have led to the separation of regulatory and partnership roles to improve private sector participation. The NRC, not DHS, oversees infrastructure security programs focusing on enhancing voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination capabilities. Lessons learned from past experiences emphasize the separation of regulatory and partnership roles to improve private sector participation. The DHS infrastructure security programs focus on enhancing collaboration with partners through information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination capabilities. Current CI partnership structures are organized under the authority of PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnership structures described in the 2013 NIPP. The 2013 NIPP outlined an infrastructure protection effort that emphasized distributed responsibility among stakeholders committed to common national resilience goals. NIPP partnerships at the federal level are administered by CISA in partnership with other DHS components and federal departments. Each of the 16 CI sectors under the NIPP framework has its own on-site assessments in certain cases. The 2013 NIPP emphasized distributed responsibility among stakeholders for infrastructure protection. NIPP partnerships at the federal level are managed by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal departments. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) for coordination on infrastructure issues. The 16 Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors under the NIPP framework have Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Councils (SCC) for interagency coordination. Each GCC is led by a Sector-Specific Agency (SSA) like DHS, EPA, GSA, and other relevant federal agencies. The 16 Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors have Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) like DHS, EPA, GSA, and other federal agencies leading Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) for interagency coordination. SSAs develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans within the NIPP framework. Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) utilize NIPP partnership structures to create infrastructure protection plans tailored to each CI sector's unique characteristics. These plans analyze sector risks, interdependencies, stakeholders, and resilience goals. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) consist of private-sector associations and CI owner-operators, operating autonomously but with recognition. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are comprised of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators. They are self-organized and recognized by the corresponding Government Coordinating Council (GCC). SCCs have advisory roles with the federal government, facilitate coordination and information-sharing between government and private stakeholders, and may support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators recognized by the Government Coordinating Council (GCC). They have advisory roles with the federal government, facilitate coordination and information-sharing, and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations, which maintain operations centers, deploy representatives to NCCIC and NICC, and prepare informational products for their members. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across CI sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across CI sectors, with four cross-sector councils representing key stakeholder groups. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC) aims to enhance infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions. The SLTTGCC, Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, Regional Consortium Coordinating Council, and Federal Senior Leadership Council represent key stakeholder groups to enhance infrastructure resilience partnerships and coordination among private-sector CI stakeholders. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council coordinates cross-sector issues among private-sector CI stakeholders. The Regional Consortium Coordinating Council represents regional CI resilience coalitions and encourages sharing of best practices. The Federal Senior Leadership Council forges policy consensus among federal agencies on CI risk management strategies. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) is chaired by the CISA Director and leads other cross-sector councils. It forges policy consensus on CI risk management strategies, coordinates with other councils, develops resource requests, and collaborates with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) may organize certain deliberations for NIPP partnership councils. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) coordinates issue management resolution, resource requests, and collaboration with international partners. It provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations under certain circumstances. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established in 2006 and its Charter has been renewed multiple times, most recently in 2018. CIPAC provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations under certain circumstances to facilitate discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics. It engages government and private-sector stakeholders to develop policy advice and recommendations for DHS and other relevant agencies. CIPAC facilitates discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics and engages stakeholders to develop policy advice for DHS and relevant agencies. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee provides advice to the Secretary on homeland security matters, with members appointed from various sectors. Subcommittees may be established to focus on specific issues. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on security matters, with members appointed from different sectors. Subcommittees, including those focused on cybersecurity and emerging technologies, may be established as needed. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council consists of industry leaders who advise the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, comprised of senior industry leaders, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. It serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. Established in 2001, it monitors the development and operations of critical infrastructure. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council acts as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President. It was established in 2001 to monitor critical infrastructure development and operations, encouraging private industry to improve risk management practices. The partnership structure is flat and involves various activities such as symposia, research collaborations, and policy deliberations. The partnership structure of critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils involves various activities such as symposia, research collaborations, working groups, policy deliberations, and emergency preparedness and response activities. Participation in these activities often includes governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, with increasing representation from multiple CI sectors to address interdependencies in complex systems. The partnership structure of critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils involves various activities such as symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. Participation includes governmental and non-governmental stakeholders from multiple sectors to address interdependencies in complex systems. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) maintains operational elements for coordination and information sharing functions. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) is a key element in the partnership structure of critical infrastructure, providing centralized hubs for coordination, information sharing, threat analysis, and decision support to private sector partners. It operates in real-time and is part of the DHS National Operations Center. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information in real-time within the critical infrastructure partnership network. It also provides decision support and training to private sector partners. The NICC is part of the DHS National Operations Center, which is the principal operations center for the Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) monitors cybersecurity incidents and performs related analytic functions, administered by CISA. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) serves as a monitoring and incident response center for cybersecurity incidents, administered by CISA. The partnership system aims to increase trust between public and private sectors for greater industry investment in system-level resilience. The current partnership system aims to increase trust between public and private sectors for greater industry investment in system-level resilience. Private sector participation in collaboration and information-sharing initiatives is being questioned for its effectiveness in incentivizing investments beyond business reasons. Legislative remedies may be needed to address these issues. Private sector participation in collaboration and information-sharing initiatives with federal departments and agencies is being questioned for its effectiveness in incentivizing investments beyond business reasons. Legislative remedies may be necessary to address the issue of broader and more effective investments in risk reduction. Legislative remedies may be needed for broader and more effective investments in risk reduction within the critical infrastructure enterprise. Empirical analyses on collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited, with only half of the sectors actively engaged in CIP issues. Strong communities of interest are found in sectors with specific threats. Limited studies on the effectiveness of collaboration within the voluntary framework for critical infrastructure protection show that only half of the sectors actively engage in CIP issues. Strong communities of interest are found in sectors with specific threats, where private-sector risk mitigation investment is influenced by cost-benefit analysis. Many CI owner-operators believe that the government should cover externalized social costs incurred by terrorist attacks. Private-sector risk mitigation investment is influenced by cost-benefit analysis, with many CI owner-operators believing the government should cover social costs from terrorist attacks. GAO testimony in 2014 highlighted challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to information sharing and measuring effectiveness. The GAO testified in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to information sharing and measuring effectiveness. DHS did not systematically collect data on industry participation in security surveys or whether security improvements were made as a result. This hinders DHS's ability to evaluate program effectiveness. The GAO found that DHS lacked systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and the impact of security improvements. This hinders the evaluation of program effectiveness despite DHS agreeing to corrective measures. The GAO found that DHS lacked systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and the impact of security improvements. Despite DHS agreeing to corrective measures, GAO has not verified their progress in implementing them. There is extensive partnership activity across multiple critical infrastructure sectors, but few measures to assess the effectiveness of these activities in meeting resilience goals. Congress may need to explore the progress of implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to better evaluate the partnership system's effectiveness in incentivizing industry information. Relatively few measures exist to assess the effectiveness of partnership activities in meeting resilience goals. Congress may need to explore the progress of implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to better evaluate the effectiveness of industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction. Reliable data on public-partnership programs' reach and effectiveness in incentivizing bidirectional information sharing and private investments at a national level is lacking. Congress may need to explore the effectiveness of public-partnership programs in incentivizing industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction. Reliable data on the reach and effectiveness of these programs at a national level is lacking, indicating a need for appropriate reporting requirements and potential enhancement of regulatory authorities. Enhancement of regulatory authorities and reporting requirements may be necessary to improve industry information sharing and resilience at a national level. Congress could consider addressing gaps in program effectiveness through appropriate measures like the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. Authorities of federal departments and agencies may intervene to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals when voluntary measures fail or emergent threats require immediate action. An example is the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, expanding CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting the trade system for control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may also oversee regulatory authorities not being utilized, such as in the case of TSA. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has expanded its jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may oversee regulatory authorities, like the TSA, that are not being utilized. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination. Adjustments to these structures may be considered to improve partnership efforts in federal risk management. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination. Congress may consider adjustments to streamline partnership efforts with the federal risk management approach."
