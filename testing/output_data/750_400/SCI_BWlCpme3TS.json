Our experiments on WMT and UN datasets show that our variant outperforms the standard transformer, converges faster, and learns more robust character-level alignments. Most existing NMT models operate on word or subword-level. Our transformer variant excels in bilingual and multilingual translation to English with up to three input languages.

Fully character-level translation was first explored in a previous study using a recurrent encoder-decoder model with convolutional layers and max pooling. Lee et al. (2017) introduced a character-level translation model that combines convolutional layers, max pooling, and highway layers in the encoder. Their decoder generates translations one character at a time with attention on encoded representations, showing promising results for multilingual translation. Training on multiple source languages improved performance without architectural changes. Lee et al.

The transformer is an attention-driven encoder-decoder model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on sequence modelling tasks in NLP. The transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, has revolutionized sequence modeling tasks in NLP by using self-attention instead of recurrence. Recent work has shown that attention is effective for encoding words, even though it may not seem as relevant for characters. The standard transformer architecture consists of encoder and decoder layers that use self-attention for processing input and generating output sequences. Recent work has shown that attention can effectively model characters, prompting investigation into character-level bilingual and multilingual translation with transformers. The paper investigates the effectiveness of using the convtransformer architecture for character-level bilingual and multilingual translation with transformers. The proposed modification includes adding sub-blocks to each encoder block, inspired by previous work on 1D convolutional layers. The convtransformer architecture modifies the standard transformer by adding sub-blocks to each encoder block, inspired by 1D convolutional layers. Different context window sizes are used for character interactions of varying granularity levels, and the representations are fused using an additional convolutional layer. The convtransformer architecture enhances the standard transformer by incorporating 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes for character interactions. The representations are fused using an additional convolutional layer, maintaining the input dimensionality without compression. Additionally, a residual connection from input to output is included for flexibility. In contrast to previous work, the convtransformer model maintains input dimensionality without compression and includes a residual connection for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on two datasets, WMT15 DE\u2192EN and newstest-2014, to test different model configurations for character-level translation. We experiment on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN), using different model configurations for character-level translation. The UN dataset allows for multilingual experiments with sentences from six languages in the same domain. Training corpora are constructed by sampling one million sentence pairs. The main experiments are conducted using the United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN) for multilingual translation to English. Training corpora are created by sampling one million sentence pairs from the FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset. The BLEU scores on the UN dataset for different input training languages are evaluated on three test sets (t-FR, t-ES, t-ZH) with English as the target language. The study involved randomly sampling one million sentence pairs from the UN dataset in French, Spanish, and Chinese for translation to English. Bilingual datasets were combined and shuffled to create multilingual datasets. Chinese data was latinized using the Wubi encoding method. Testing was done using different test sets with English as the target language. In the study, bilingual datasets were combined and shuffled to create multilingual datasets for training models with different input languages. Chinese data was latinized using the Wubi encoding method. Testing was done using original UN test sets for each language pair. In experiments, models were trained in bilingual and multilingual scenarios using different input languages without language identifiers. BLEU performance of character-level architectures on the WMT dataset was compared in Table 1. In Table 1, BLEU performance of character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset is compared. Character-level training is 3 to 5 times slower than subword-level training. The character-level transformer model trained on the WMT dataset outperforms the recurrent model from Lee et al. (2017) and is competitive with subword-level transformers while requiring fewer parameters. Character-level training is slower due to longer sequence lengths, but the convtransformer variant performs equally well.

The convtransformer variant performs equally well on the dataset, with multilingual experiments showing consistent results. In Table 2, BLEU results on the UN dataset using the 6-layer transformer/convtransformer models are reported. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer on this dataset, with a gap of up to 2.3 BLEU on bilingual translation (ZH\u2192EN) and up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation (FR+ZH\u2192EN). Training multilingual models on similar input languages (FR + ES\u2192EN) leads to improved performance for both languages. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer on the UN dataset, with up to 2.3 BLEU gap on bilingual translation (ZH\u2192EN) and up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation (FR+ZH\u2192EN). Training on distant languages can still be effective, but closer input languages lead to improved performance for both languages. Training on distant languages can still be effective, with models trained on FR+ZH\u2192EN outperforming those trained on just FR\u2192EN. However, bilingual models trained on ZH\u2192EN perform better. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup compared to the transformer. The convtransformer, although 30% slower to train than the transformer, reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup. Character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed to understand their performance. Comparing alignments learned by multilingual models to bilingual models provides insights into their effectiveness. In analyzing multilingual models, character alignments are compared between multilingual and bilingual models to assess alignment quality. Bilingual models are seen as having more flexibility to learn high-quality alignments due to focusing on a single input language, while multilingual models may struggle with lower quality alignments due to potential distractions or dissimilar languages. Multilingual models may struggle with lower quality alignments compared to bilingual models due to potential distractions or dissimilar languages. Alignment quality is quantified using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on sampled sentences from UN testing datasets.

Results show strong positive correlation for similar source and target languages. The analysis is conducted on transformer and convtransformer models separately, with a focus on encoder-decoder attention. The results indicate that alignments can be simultaneously learned for bilingual models, but introducing a distant source language leads to a drop in correlation.
