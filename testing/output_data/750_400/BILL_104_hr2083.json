    "content": "The Act titled \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" allows for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must notify the President and Congress if economic growth is below 1.5% and national unemployment is above 6.5%. Economic growth is estimated to be less than 1.5% annually, and national unemployment is estimated to be greater than 6.5%. The testing periods consist of the quarter during notification and the preceding quarter, as well as the preceding 4 quarters. The testing periods for notification consist of the quarter when the notification is given, the quarter before, the previous 4 quarters, and the following 2 quarters. Presidential authorization for temporary tax reductions can be issued after notification. After notification, the President may declare temporary income tax reductions for a specified calendar year to stimulate the economy, which must be transmitted to Congress. Temporary income tax reductions are required for a specified calendar year to provide a quick fiscal stimulus to the economy, and any declaration must be transmitted to Congress. This includes temporary tax reductions effective for taxable years beginning in the specified calendar year. Effective for taxable years beginning in the specified calendar year, the rates for the first income bracket in the tax tables will be reduced by a percentage specified in the declaration, not exceeding 3 percent. The first income bracket in the tax tables will be reduced by a percentage (up to 3 percent) specified in the declaration, and the tax amounts in the tables will be adjusted accordingly. Withholding tables or procedures will also be adjusted. The tax amounts in the tables will be adjusted to reflect a rate reduction, and withholding tables will be modified to ensure the full calendar year effect of the reduction is reflected through withholding reductions. The Secretary of the Treasury or delegate will modify withholding tables under section 3402(a) of the Code to reflect the full calendar year effect of a rate reduction through withholding reductions. A temporary surtax may apply if economic growth requirements are subsequently met in the following calendar year. The Secretary of the Treasury will adjust withholding tables to reflect rate reductions for a full calendar year. A temporary surtax may be imposed if economic growth requirements are met in the subsequent calendar year. Each tax rate in the tax tables of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a certain percentage each year, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers with Adjusted Gross Income below that amount. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased annually, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000, whose rates will remain the same as the previous year.

President determines in the Federal Register that for a calendar year, economic growth (GDP change) is over 4.5% and national unemployment rate is below 5.5%. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will increase based on these criteria. The President will increase tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if economic growth is over 4.5% and national unemployment is below 5.5%. The tax rate increase percentage is based on these criteria. The President will adjust tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 based on economic conditions, without raising taxes for individuals with lower Adjusted Gross Income. The specific percentage change will be published in the Federal Register before the start of the relevant calendar year. SEC. 3.
