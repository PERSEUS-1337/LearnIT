The chapter applies to State post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions.

The court must appoint counsel for indigent prisoners under capital sentence based on their acceptance or rejection of counsel. Counsel appointed for a State prisoner under a capital sentence cannot have previously represented the prisoner unless requested. The chapter applies to State post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. Counsel appointed for a State prisoner under a capital sentence cannot have previously represented the prisoner unless requested. Ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief. Different counsel can be appointed at any phase of post-conviction proceedings. In a capital case, the ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings is not a basis for relief. Different counsel can be appointed at any stage of these proceedings. Upon an order from the State court, the execution of a State prisoner is stayed. Federal post-conviction proceedings involve a mandatory stay of execution for State prisoners, which can be granted upon application to the appropriate court. The stay expires under certain conditions. Federal post-conviction proceedings require a stay of execution for State prisoners, granted by applying to the court with specific recitations. The stay expires if the prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition in time or if the petition for relief is denied after court reviews. The stay of execution for State prisoners expires if they fail to file a habeas corpus petition in time or if the petition for relief is denied after court reviews. The stay of execution for State prisoners expires if relief is denied, the time for filing a petition for certiorari has expired, or if the Supreme Court denies or upholds the capital sentence upon consideration. Alternatively, a State prisoner may waive the right to pursue relief before a court of competent jurisdiction. If a State prisoner's stay of execution expires due to denial of relief, expiration of time for filing certiorari, or Supreme Court decision upholding the capital sentence, no Federal court can enter a stay. Alternatively, the prisoner may waive habeas corpus review before a competent court. Prisoners under a capital sentence can waive habeas corpus review in the presence of counsel. If certain conditions are met, no Federal court can grant relief or enter a stay of execution in a capital case unless the claim was not previously presented in State or Federal courts. Federal court can only grant relief or enter a stay of execution in a capital case if the claim was not previously raised in State or Federal courts, or if the failure to raise the claim was due to specific circumstances outlined in the law. The Federal court can grant relief or stay of execution in a capital case if the claim violates the Constitution, involves a new Federal right retroactively applicable, or is based on undiscoverable facts. The claim must undermine the court's confidence in the jury's decision. The habeas corpus petition must be filed in the appropriate district court within specific time requirements. The petition can be granted if it involves new Federal rights, constitutional violations, or undiscoverable facts that undermine the court's confidence in the jury's decision. The filing of a habeas corpus petition must adhere to specific time requirements, with a deadline of 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c) of this title. The time limits can be paused during certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court. The time limits for filing a habeas corpus petition are set at 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c) of this title. These time requirements can be paused in certain situations, like when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court. The habeas corpus petition can be filed by a State prisoner seeking review of a capital sentence that has been affirmed on direct appeal or has become final for State law purposes. The filing deadline can be extended in certain circumstances, such as when a request for post-conviction review is pending in a State court or when an extension of time is requested by the State prisoner's counsel in the Federal district court. The filing deadline for a habeas corpus petition by a State prisoner seeking review of a capital sentence can be extended in certain circumstances, such as when a request for post-conviction review is pending in a State court or when the State prisoner's counsel requests an extension of time in the Federal district court. The filing deadline for a habeas corpus petition by a State prisoner seeking review of a capital sentence can be extended in certain circumstances. The time requirement can be tolled from the initial post-conviction review filing until the final disposition by the highest state court if all state filing rules are met. The time requirement for a habeas corpus petition by a State prisoner seeking review of a capital sentence can be tolled from the initial filing for post-conviction review until the final disposition by the highest state court, as long as all state filing rules are met. Tolling does not occur during the pendency of a certiorari petition before the Supreme Court following state post-conviction review. Sec. 2259 states that tolling does not occur during a certiorari petition before the Supreme Court following state post-conviction review for a State prisoner under a capital sentence filing a habeas corpus petition. The district court determines the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on claims presented in State courts. The district court determines the sufficiency of the evidentiary record for habeas corpus review based on the claims presented in State courts, unless certain exceptions apply. The failure to raise a claim in State courts may be due to State action violating the Constitution, a new retroactively applicable Federal right recognized by the Supreme Court, or based on facts discovered too late for State post-conviction review. Evidentiary hearings will be conducted if necessary. The district court will conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings to complete the record for habeas corpus review and rule on the merits of the claims. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause is not applicable.
