    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reevaluating the causes of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. Discussions on poverty and public policy prompt the question: Who are the poor in the United States? The persistently high poverty rate since 2000 has led policymakers to reexamine the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A snapshot of who was poor in 2015 shows that people in poverty are a diverse group with varying demographic, economic, and social characteristics. The report provides a snapshot of poverty in the United States in 2015, highlighting the diverse characteristics of individuals and families living in different circumstances. Special attention is given to the role of work in the lives of those in poverty, emphasizing the importance of income from work for economic stability. The report focuses on the significance of work and income for individuals and families in poverty, considering factors like living arrangements and age. Individuals' economic well-being after retirement is influenced by their prior workforce experience and living arrangements. Factors like who they live with and share resources with also impact their economic status. The report examines the composition of people in poverty rather than poverty rates among different groups. The report focuses on the composition of people in poverty, looking at what groups make up the poverty population rather than poverty rates among different groups. It highlights how the size of a population group can affect its share of the poverty population. The report focuses on the composition of people in poverty, highlighting how the size of a population group can affect its share of the poverty population. Different demographic groups may have varying poverty rates, with non-Hispanic whites having relatively low rates but representing a large share of the poverty population, while smaller groups like American Indians may have higher rates but a smaller share. Both perspectives are relevant for public policy. For more details on poverty rates for different groups and trends over time, refer to CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States. American Indians have high poverty rates but represent a small share of the poverty population. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, measured by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census poverty measure is family-based. The official measure of poverty used by the U.S. Census Bureau is family-based, where individuals are identified as \"poor\" based on their money income and the income of any family members they live with. If an individual lives alone or with non-relatives, they are considered a family of one. The U.S. Census Bureau's official measure of poverty is family-based, where individuals are identified as \"poor\" based on their money income and the income of any family members they live with. If an individual lives alone or with non-relatives, they are considered a family of one, and only their income is counted in determining their poverty status. The poverty threshold is based on the individual's family composition, with specific dollar amounts set for different family types. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a working-age single person not living in a family was $12,331. The poverty status is determined based on an individual's income compared to a dollar threshold, which varies depending on family composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a single person was $12,331, and for a family of two adults and two children, it was $24,036. The official poverty measure has been in place for about 50 years but has limitations. The poverty threshold is used to determine if an individual or family is considered poor based on their income. The official poverty measure has been in place for about 50 years but has limitations, such as only looking at pre-tax income and not considering government taxes or non-cash benefits. The official poverty measure has limitations as it only considers pre-tax income and does not account for government taxes or non-cash benefits. It also does not take into consideration the impact of assets, living costs in different areas, or modern resource-sharing arrangements like those of cohabiting couples. The Census Bureau now publishes a supplemental measure. The official poverty measure does not consider differences in living costs or modern resource-sharing arrangements. The Census Bureau now publishes a supplemental poverty measure that takes into account taxes, transfers, housing costs, and an expanded definition of family. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold. The Census Bureau introduced a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) in 2015, considering taxes, transfers, housing costs, and an expanded family definition. An estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold, with 13.5% of the population classified as poor. Attention has been focused on the very poor, known as \"deep poverty.\" In 2015, 13.5% of the population was classified as poor, with close to half of them (45.1%) living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. An estimated 19.4 million people were considered to be in deep poverty. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people, close to half of all those in poverty (45.1%), were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. The population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. In 2015, people living in poverty included individuals of all ages, both sexes, and various racial and ethnic groups. Figure 3 displays the age composition of the population in poverty, with children making up one-third (14.5 million) of those in poverty. Working-age adults (18-64) were the largest group in poverty, but they were under-represented compared to the overall population. In 2015, individuals in poverty included all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Children comprised one-third of those in poverty, with working-age adults being the largest group. People age 65 and older were underrepresented in poverty compared to the overall population. Figure 4 shows the racial/ethnic composition of people in poverty and the total population in 2015. In 2015, individuals in poverty included all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group overall (61.4% of the total population) and represented the largest group within the poverty population (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group in poverty. Older adults aged 65 and above were underrepresented in poverty compared to the overall population. In 2015, racial and ethnic groups were ranked by population size. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest group overall (61.4%) and in poverty (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group (17.8% of the total population) and represented 28.1% of the poor. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, with 12.3% and 22.0% respectively. Minority groups were over-represented in poverty. In 2015, Hispanics were the second largest group (17.8% of the total population) and represented 28.1% of the poor. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, with 12.3% and 22.0% respectively. Minority groups were over-represented in poverty, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives, and non-Hispanic persons of two or more races. Under-represented groups were non-Hispanic whites and Asians. In 2015, minority groups such as Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives, and non-Hispanic persons of two or more races were over-represented in the poverty population. Children were more racially and ethnically diverse than adults, with minorities being over-represented in poverty for all age groups. In 2015, minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population across all age groups. Children, especially Hispanic children, were more racially diverse than adults. Women slightly outnumbered men in the overall population, with women representing a larger share in poverty. In 2015, Hispanic children made up 36.3% of poor children, while non-Hispanic white children accounted for 51.4% of children overall. Women slightly outnumbered men in the total population, with women representing 55.9% of the population in poverty due to factors like heading single-parent households and lower earnings compared to men. In 2015, women represented 55.9% of the population in poverty, possibly due to heading single-parent households and lower earnings compared to men. Poverty poses different policy considerations for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents and policies affecting their family income and poverty status are crucial. Poverty raises various policy considerations for different age groups. Children are dependents, working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves, and aged adults may retire and receive income from benefits based on past work. The report explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support for individuals and families. The report separately explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, emphasizing the central role of work as the primary means of economic support for individuals and families. It also considers living arrangements and the importance of sharing resources for economic well-being. Children accounted for one-third of all people in poverty in America in 2015. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or other adult caretakers for support. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or other adult caretakers for support, which is likely to come from earnings from their work. The composition of poor children and children in the total population by the number of adult workers in the family is shown in Figure 7 for 2015. In 2015, the majority of children in the total population lived in families with at least one adult earner, while two-thirds of poor children lived in families with one or more earners. Among children in the total population, over 90% lived in families with at least one adult earner, with 50.3% in families with two or more earners. Two-thirds of poor children lived in families with earners, with 57.5% in families with one earner and 10.5% in families with two or more earners. 32.1% of poor children lived in families with no income from earnings, influenced by the type of family structure. Children in poor families are mostly in households with one earner, while a small percentage live in households with two or more earners. The number of potential adult earners in a child's family depends on the family structure, with single-parent families having one earner and married couples having at least two earners. Female-headed families account for a majority of poor children. In 2015, children in female-headed families made up the majority of poor children, while children in married couple families accounted for one-third of all poor children. Despite the lower poverty rate for children in married couple families, they still represented a significant portion of the overall child population. In 2015, children in married couple families accounted for one-third of all poor children, despite having a lower poverty rate. Married-couple families were under-represented among children in poverty compared to the overall population. Poor children are more likely to live in larger families. Children in poverty are more likely to live in larger families, which require more income to meet needs. Larger families are more likely to be poor because earnings are not determined by family size but by what the worker can command in the labor market. Married-couple families are under-represented among children in poverty compared to the overall population. Larger families require more income to meet needs, leading to higher poverty thresholds. Despite earnings being determined by the labor market, larger families are more likely to be poor. In 2015, 27% of poor children were in families with four or more children, compared to 14.2% in the overall population. In 2015, 27% of children in poverty were in families with four or more children, higher than the 14.2% in the overall population. Working-age adults (18-64 years old) made up the majority of people in poverty, representing 56.6% in 2015. In 2015, the majority of people in poverty in America were working-age adults (18-64 years old), representing 56.6% of all individuals. Among working-age adults who were poor, the majority had earnings from work in 2015. In 2015, the majority of working-age adults in poverty had earnings from work, but a significant portion did not work at all. 38.8% of poor working-age adults were employed in some capacity, with only 10.4% working full-time all year. In 2015, 61.3% of poor working-age adults did not have earnings from work. Among them, 38.8% were working either full- or part-time, full- or part-year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability. Among non-working poor adults, reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability. Research shows that educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce, with higher education levels leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. A large body of research has shown that success in the workforce is related to educational attainment, with higher levels of education leading to higher earnings and steadier work. In 2015, the largest group of poor working-age adults were those with a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential. In 2015, the largest group of poor working-age adults were those with a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential, accounting for 55.5% of the population. Those without a high school diploma made up 25.1% of all poor working-age adults, more than double the overall population. In 2015, the largest group of poor working-age adults were those with a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential, accounting for 55.5% of the population. Those lacking a high school diploma accounted for another 25.1% of all poor working-age adults, more than twice the share represented in the overall population. Working-age adults represented a diverse group in terms of their family and living arrangements. Among working-age adults, those with only a high school diploma continue to be the largest group of poor individuals. Family living arrangements were more prevalent in the overall population compared to the poor, with a majority living in families. Working-age adults not living in families were disproportionately poor in 2015. Among working-age adults, family living arrangements were more common in the overall population (77.9%) than among the poor (58.8%). A significant portion of working-age adults in poverty lived outside of families, including those living alone (18.1%), with cohabiting partners (11.7%), or other unrelated adults/roommates (11.4%). Determining the poverty status of individuals living outside of families but with others is complex. In 2015, a significant portion of working-age adults in poverty lived outside of families, including those living alone (18.1%), with cohabiting partners (11.7%), or other unrelated adults/roommates (11.4%). Determining the poverty status of individuals in these living arrangements is complex due to the individual income basis for assessment. In 2015, aged adults were the least likely to live below the poverty line, with a poverty rate of 8.8%. They accounted for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% of the population in poverty. 77.0% of adults aged 65 and older did not work in 2015, retiring with support from public and private sector policies. In 2015, aged adults had a poverty rate of 8.8%, lower than the general population. 77.0% of adults aged 65 and older did not work, relying on various forms of income for economic well-being. In 2015, aged adults had a poverty rate of 8.8%, lower than the general population. 77.0% of adults aged 65 and older did not work, relying on various forms of income for economic well-being. Social Security income is earned through past work, with the initial benefit determined based on past earnings, replacing a portion of those earnings. In 2015, Social Security was received by the families of 62.4% of all aged persons who are poor, compared to 86.0% of aged persons in the total population. Aged persons also receive income from pensions and other benefits earned from past jobs, including private or government pensions. Fewer aged adults in poverty receive these benefits compared to the overall aged population. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only by 7.7% of aged persons in poverty. Additionally, earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only by 7.7% of aged persons in poverty. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families, with only 11.0% of poor aged persons' families receiving such earnings. Most aged adults (97.2%) lived in families with income derived from work. In 2015, 97.2% of aged adults lived in families with income derived from work, including past work with Social Security or pension income, or current work. Among aged persons in poverty, 71.7% still lived in families with work-derived income. Figure 14 illustrates aged adults living in poverty by living arrangement, highlighting the importance of resource-sharing. In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a significantly higher rate than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. This report provides basic information about 43 million people. The report presents basic information about the 43 million Americans living below the poverty line in 2015, showing that they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Aged adults in poverty were more likely to live alone and less likely to be part of a family compared to the overall aged population. The report highlights the diversity among the 43 million Americans living below the poverty line in 2015, showing that they are not a homogenous group. Certain groups such as women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone are over-represented in this population. The central role of income from work is emphasized in understanding poverty. Certain groups, including women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone, are over-represented among those living in poverty. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on their parents' or family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on their past work. The central role of income from work in determining poverty status is highlighted, with children relying on parents' or family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past work. Despite earnings from work, sometimes poverty persists, as seen with two-thirds of children in poverty having at least one adult earning income in 2015. In 2015, a significant number of children and aged persons living in poverty had some form of work-based income, highlighting the complexity of circumstances leading to poverty. Further exploration of these circumstances is necessary for effective federal policy interventions."
