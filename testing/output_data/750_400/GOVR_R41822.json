    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's outstanding residential mortgage debt. They purchase mortgages, pool and guarantee them into mortgage-backed securities, and sell them to investors or hold them as investments. In recent years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. However, in 2008, their capital proved inadequate due to increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures, leading to higher borrowing costs. To support the mortgage markets during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of the Treasury intervened to keep these enterprises in business. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced capital inadequacy due to rising mortgage defaults and foreclosures. To support them during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock and the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock to support enterprises in business. Treasury and the Federal Reserve have also provided mortgage market support by buying nearly $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. The enterprises are required to pay a 10% cash dividend on the Treasury funds, and their survival without continued support is uncertain. Some proposed bills may reduce the enterprises' future size by eliminating certain advantages. The enterprises are required to pay a 10% cash dividend on the Treasury funds. Proposed legislation, such as H.R. 1222, could increase their cost of doing business, potentially leading to lower prices for mortgages and higher interest rates for borrowers. Proposed legislation, like H.R. 1222, may increase the enterprises' costs, leading to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. Other bills could limit the types of mortgages they can purchase, allowing more competition in the market. Some bills also aim to increase regulatory oversight. The proposed legislation, such as H.R. 1222, may increase costs for the enterprises, potentially leading to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. Other bills aim to limit the types of mortgages they can purchase, increasing competition in the market. Some bills also focus on increasing regulatory oversight and disclosure. The bills, such as H.R. 31 and H.R. 1225, propose increased regulatory oversight, disclosure, and capital requirements to reduce risks. New SEC filing requirements would eliminate competitive advantages and align the enterprises with competitors. Additional legislative proposals aim to return the enterprises to stockholder control or dissolve them, phasing out their charters. (e.g., H.R. 408 / S. 178 and H.R. 1182 / S. 693) A fifth category of legislative proposals would replace the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets (e.g. H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413). The bills aim to set a deadline for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved, phasing out their charters. Table 1 summarizes the differences in provisions of the various bills introduced in the 112th Congress. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) due to financial difficulties from mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. Various bills in the 112th Congress proposed replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) due to financial difficulties from mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. The Treasury signed contracts to provide financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners and potential homeowners indirectly rely on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for mortgage funding. The Treasury signed contracts with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners depend on them for mortgage funding as they purchase mortgages from lenders and package them into MBS for institutional investors. They also provide guarantees for loan repayment. The Obama Administration's report on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac presents three alternatives for the housing finance system: a privatized system with existing government mortgage programs, more narrowly targeted. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back almost half of the nation's home mortgages. The Obama Administration's report on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac outlines three alternatives for the housing finance system, including a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted towards specific groups. No legislation has been introduced to implement these proposals yet.

The bill requires quarterly reports on various aspects of enterprise operations, including executive compensation, conforming loan limits, foreclosure mitigation, mortgage fraud prevention, and equity investments by Treasury. The FHFA inspector general would review the reports, examining loss mitigation policies and the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. Reports and comments would be posted on the FHFA website. The Enterprises' Financial Performance includes capital, investments, and loss mitigation activities. FHFA's monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report also covers loss mitigation efforts. Congress has shown particular interest in oversight of these areas through legislation such as H.R. 463. The Committee on Financial Services forwarded H.R. 31 to the full committee, emphasizing oversight of FHFA and the FHFA IG. H.R. 463 aims to make Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac subject to FOIA requests, while H.R. 1221 seeks to limit executive compensation at the enterprises. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, H.R. 463, would subject the enterprises to FOIA requests by treating them as federal agencies. H.R. 1221, the Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, aims to restrict executive pay at the enterprises, with excess pay to be turned over to the Treasury. Executive compensation packages approved by FHFA would be suspended, with excess pay over $199,700 or $179,700 to be turned over to the Treasury. Other employees would be paid based on the federal government's general schedule, with a maximum pay of $155,500 in 2011. Compensation for executives would be tied to the enterprise's profitability and covered by TARP provisions. Enterprise employees would not be considered for certain benefits.

Regulatory determinations on \"qualified residential mortgages\" would be required by the bill. H.R. 1223, the GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, aims to prohibit treating mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises differently from similar MBS issued by other companies. The bill requires regulatory determinations on \"qualified residential mortgages\" not to be solely based on the enterprises' role in securitization, as mandated by Dodd-Frank. The Dodd-Frank Act requires joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS, with QRMs exempt. H.R. 1223 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The House Subcommittee marked up H.R. 1223 to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS under Dodd-Frank, with QRMs exempt. Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that enterprises are not exempt from risk retention, as their guarantee does not meet requirements. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt enterprises from the risk retention requirement due to their guarantee not meeting the criteria. However, proposed rules would allow the enterprises' guarantees to satisfy the risk retention requirements if they were in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224, GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, would mandate the enterprises to reduce their portfolios over five years. The proposed rules would allow enterprises' guarantees to satisfy risk retention requirements if they were in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224 mandates the enterprises to reduce their portfolios over five years to $250 billion each, with Fannie Mae's portfolio at $789 billion and Freddie Mac's at $697 billion in 2010. Treasury-GSE financial support agreements require mortgage portfolio reductions annually to reach $250 billion. The financial support agreements between Treasury and the GSEs require the enterprises to reduce their portfolios over five years to $250 billion each, starting from $900 billion in 2009. Companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 follow the same schedule, while H.R. 408 and S. 178 aim for a four-year reduction. Table 2 compares the portfolio caps under different bills.

The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1224 and forwarded it to the full committee. FHFA, as regulator, could order enterprises to reduce risk by reducing portfolios more rapidly. H.R. 1225 would require enterprises to seek permission from the Secretary of the Treasury to issue new debt. H.R. 1225, GSE Debt Issuance Approval Act of 2011, would require enterprises to request permission from the Treasury Secretary to issue new debt.

The House Subcommittee marked up H.R. 1225 and sent it to the full committee. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's charters give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to review their debt issuance. This authority was previously used to prevent the enterprises from issuing large amounts of debt close to Treasury debt sales. Former Assistant Secretary Emil Henry mentioned a more formal process in the past. The Secretary could potentially assert this existing review authority.
