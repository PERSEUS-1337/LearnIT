The Congress recognizes the Department of Energy's unique mathematics and science capabilities that contribute to education. There is a need to enhance collaboration between the Department of Energy, other federal agencies, and the mathematics and science education community, which includes nationally recognized teachers. The mathematics and science education community, including outstanding teachers, can provide valuable insight into effective education programs. A pilot program has shown the effectiveness of these teachers serving in professional staff roles in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Act establishes a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". Definitions are provided in Section 4. The Act defines key terms such as \"contractor\" as a nonprofit educational organization administering the fellowship program, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy, \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"outstanding\" in relation to teachers. The term \"outstanding\" for elementary or secondary school math or science teachers is defined as being a State or national winner of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, or having participated in the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program. Elementary or secondary school mathematics or science teacher defined as a State or national winner of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program participant, or recipient of comparable recognition. Must have received a sabbatical leave to participate in the fellowship program. The individual must be a State or national winner of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, participant in the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program, or received comparable recognition.
