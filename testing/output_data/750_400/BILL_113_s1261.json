    "content": "The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act, also known as the Energy Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies Act, aims to promote energy-efficient technologies in government operations. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies, requiring collaboration between Federal agencies and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop an implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies within one year of this subsection's enactment. Each Federal agency must develop a flexible, cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies based on their specific operating requirements and statutory mission. Each Federal agency must develop a flexible, cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies (ICT) based on their specific operating requirements and statutory mission. This includes considering advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services and products, and efficient data center strategies. The subsection discusses energy-efficient information and communications technologies (ICT) and related infrastructure, including advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services and products, efficient data center strategies, ICT power management, and building information modeling for energy management. The curr_chunk discusses methods to increase ICT asset utilization, power management, building information modeling for energy management, and secure telework tools to ensure agency savings and efficiency. The curr_chunk focuses on establishing performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving maintenance, purchase, and utilization, including energy management and secure telework tools. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems within 180 days of enactment. This includes energy-efficient data centers. The Director will establish performance goals for improving energy-efficient data centers, including specifications and benchmarks for informed decision-making. The Director will establish specifications, benchmarks, and recommendations for improving energy efficiency and cost savings in Federal data centers, including asset utilization and best practices. The Director will establish benchmarks for increased energy efficiency in Federal data centers, including asset utilization and best practices for achieving these benchmarks. Recommendations will include evaluating energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting. The Director will establish benchmarks for increased energy efficiency in Federal data centers, including evaluating energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting as preferred acquisition methods. Performance goals will measure information technology costs over a specific time period of 3 to 5 years and cost savings attained. The Director will establish benchmarks for increased energy efficiency in Federal data centers, including evaluating energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services as preferred acquisition methods. Performance goals will measure IT costs over 3 to 5 years and cost savings achieved through energy-efficient solutions. The Director will maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers to promote energy-efficient solutions and provide a complete picture of costs and savings. The Director will maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force consisting of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers to collaborate on achieving agency and Federal energy efficiency goals. The task force members are responsible for sharing progress towards agency and Federal energy efficiency goals, exchanging best practices with the private sector, and submitting reports as required by each Federal agency. The task force members regularly exchange best practices and strategic information on energy efficiency with the private sector. Each Federal agency must report their efforts and results under this subsection. The agency must report its efforts and results under this subsection in the annual report. The Director will include a description of these efforts in the government efficiency reports and scorecards starting from October 1, 2013. Starting from October 1, 2013, the Director will include a description of Federal agencies' efforts and results in the annual report and scorecard required under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate the program described in subsection (b) within 30 days of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act's enactment. The designation must be made public, including on a suitable website. The Secretary and the Administrator will designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate the program within 30 days of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act's enactment. This designation will be made public, including on a suitable website. Additionally, a study will be conducted by the Secretary, with assistance from the Administrator, to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013. The Secretary, with assistance from the Administrator, will update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013, providing a comparison and gap analysis of estimates and projections from 2007 to 2012. The Data Center Energy Efficiency report, published on August 2, 2007, under Public Law 109-431, includes a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012 and an analysis of the impact of information and communications technologies in the public and private sectors. The report, under Public Law 109-431, includes an analysis of information and communications technologies impact in public and private sectors, updated projections, and collaboration with designated organizations for preparation. The Secretary collaborates with designated organizations to maintain a data center energy practitioner program for certifying energy practitioners to evaluate energy usage and efficiency in data centers. The organization, along with the Federal Chief Information Officer, maintains a program certifying energy practitioners to evaluate data center energy usage and efficiency. Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified practitioners. Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations and the Federal Chief Information Officer, will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations and the Federal Chief Information Officer, will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to empower innovation while protecting national security interests. The initiative may consider using the online Data Center Maturity Model. The Secretary will collaborate with designated organizations to establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage, considering the use of the online Data Center Maturity Model. Additionally, efforts will be made to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. The Secretary will collaborate with designated organizations to establish global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, including an efficiency metric for ICT asset utilization."
