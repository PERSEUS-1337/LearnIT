    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs such as infrastructure and support programs. The benefits of irrigation for the nation's agricultural industry have been extensive, but come with costs like infrastructure and support programs. These costs include associated infrastructure, federal assistance for irrigation investments, and potential effects on water users and the environment. The primary measurements of irrigation water use are water withdrawals and consumption. The primary measurements of irrigation water use are water withdrawals and consumption. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980, but it is unclear if this decline has led to a decrease in water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Since 2005, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 9%, but it is uncertain if this has reduced water consumption. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states increasing irrigated acres since 2003, while several eastern states have seen a significant increase, with seven states increasing irrigation by 50%. Since 2003, changes in irrigated land across the United States have varied by region. Four western states have increased irrigated acres, while several eastern states, including Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, have seen a significant increase, with seven states increasing irrigation by 50%. Farmers have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation since the 1980s, especially in 17 western states where gravity irrigation declined from 62% in 1984 to 30% in 2013. Since the 1980s, farmers in 17 western states have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. This change led to a decline in gravity irrigation from 62% in 1984 to 30% in 2013. Seven states, including Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, increased irrigation by 50%. In the West, irrigated land increased by 1.7 million acres, while applied irrigation water decreased by over 1.37 million acre-feet. The trend of declining water application started in 1998. Since the 1980s, farmers in 17 western states have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, leading to a decline in gravity irrigation from 62% in 1984 to 30% in 2013. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres, while applied irrigation water decreased by over 1.37 million acre-feet. The trend of declining water application began in 1998, with fluctuations in irrigation water withdrawals over time. Groundwater withdrawals have increased by over 740,000 AF despite overall declines in irrigation withdrawals. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. Despite a decrease in irrigation withdrawals in the West since 2003, groundwater withdrawals have increased by over 740,000 AF. Irrigation withdrawals remain highest in the western-most portions of the United States. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. The trend of increased irrigated acres in the East has been attributed to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater. This has led to a decline in aquifer levels in some areas. Irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres since 1984, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. Withdrawals peaked in 2008, increasing by 4.3 million AF since 2003. This trend is attributed to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater. The expanded use of groundwater for irrigation has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency refers to the percentage of applied water beneficially used without being lost to evaporation or seepage. The decline in aquifer levels and environmental concerns are linked to increased groundwater withdrawals for irrigation in eastern states. Irrigation efficiency is defined as the percentage of applied water beneficially used, considering factors like system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response. Evapotranspiration rate and climate conditions also play a role in determining irrigation efficiency. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors such as evapotranspiration rates, climate conditions, and water conveyance systems. Climate conditions affect evapotranspiration rates, which determine crop water requirements. Poorly constructed irrigation canals can lead to conveyance losses of up to 50%. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors such as wind speed, canopy development, and water conveyance systems. Irrigation canals that are not well constructed or maintained can lead to conveyance losses of up to 50%. Studies have shown that efficient irrigation systems may lead to greater water consumption in some cases. Efficient irrigation systems can lead to greater water consumption in some cases, despite allowing the same crop production levels as less efficient systems. Increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation may result in higher water consumption and crop yield in the Upper Rio Grande Basin. The extent of expanded irrigation nationwide due to water conservation remains unclear. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation. Water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin could increase water consumption, crop yield, and irrigated acreage. It is uncertain if expanded irrigation nationwide due to water conservation occurs and to what extent. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but gravity irrigation typically uses less water. This is because water not lost to evapotranspiration in gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources through runoff and deep percolation. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, as it typically consumes less water. Water not lost to evapotranspiration in gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources through runoff and deep percolation, allowing for potential subsequent beneficial use. Efficient irrigation technologies may lead to increased water consumption and encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Efficient irrigation technologies may not necessarily reduce overall water consumption as they could lead to farmers growing more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure systems and gravity systems based on energy and pressure requirements. Adopting more-efficient irrigation technologies may not always reduce overall water consumption due to the possibility of farmers growing water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are categorized into pressure and gravity systems, with precision technologies increasingly complementing these systems to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Precision technologies are increasingly being integrated into irrigation systems in the United States to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Best management practices for irrigation focus on improved conveyance, scheduling, and application methods on farms, based on select practices identified by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service. Best management practices (BMPs) for irrigation involve improved conveyance, scheduling, and application methods on farms. These BMPs are based on practices identified by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and can apply to both pressure and gravity irrigation systems. The success of a BMP depends on various factors and may require the application of multiple practices. For a more comprehensive list of BMPs, refer to Appendix B. Pressure irrigation systems, including sprinkler and microirrigation systems, pump water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops. BMPs listed may apply to both pressure and gravity systems, with success depending on various factors and sometimes requiring multiple practices. For a more extensive list of BMPs, refer to Appendix B. Pressure systems pump water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops using sprinkler or microirrigation systems. Sprinkler irrigation uses high- to medium-pressure systems to create artificial precipitation, while microirrigation applies water directly to the root zone of crops. Pressure irrigation systems make up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems in the United States, including center pivot, linear move tower, and solid set systems. Pressure irrigation systems, such as center pivot, linear move tower, and solid set systems, make up 58-65% of irrigation systems in the United States. These systems use high- to medium-pressure to spray water through applicators or apply water directly to the root zone of crops. They are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used to grow most crops, although the initial investment costs can be high. Pressure irrigation systems, such as center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, wheel move, big gun, traveler, hand move, and drip or micro sprinklers, are more efficient than gravity systems. They require intentional preparation for managing water application to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, maximize plant growth, lower energy consumption, and increase water efficiency. Initial investment costs can be high for these systems. An irrigation water management plan involves intentional preparation to manage water application through various irrigation systems to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, maximize plant growth, lower energy consumption, and increase water efficiency. This plan may include irrigation BMPs like microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, land leveling, and tailwater recovery. Sprinkler systems, such as center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation, are common types of pressure irrigation systems. The irrigation plan may include various BMPs such as microirrigation, sprinkler systems, ditch lining, land leveling, and tailwater recovery. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for soil moisture. Microirrigation includes low-pressure systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation for efficient watering. Microirrigation systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation are efficient methods that apply water directly to the root zone of crops. This enhances standard center pivot irrigation systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems. LEPA systems deliver water into circular furrows through nozzles placed close to the crops. LEPA irrigation systems are more efficient than sprinkler and gravity methods as they apply water directly to the root zone of crops. Gravity systems divert water to flood crop areas, while LEPA systems deliver water into circular furrows through nozzles close to the soil surface to reduce evaporation and energy consumption. LEPA irrigation systems apply water directly to the root zone of crops through nozzles close to the soil surface, reducing evaporation and energy consumption. Gravity systems divert water to flood crop areas via land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. These systems have lower efficiency compared to pressure systems and varying initial investment costs. Flooding methods like basin, border, and furrow irrigation use land-forming measures to increase efficiencies. Uncontrolled flooding, the simplest form of irrigation, is less efficient than pressure systems. Gravity systems have lower efficiency and varying costs. Gravity systems are suitable for close-growing crops like rice, while furrow irrigation can be used for row crops like potato and corn. Land leveling is reshaping a field to ensure uniform water application without creating puddles. Land leveling is the process of reshaping a field to ensure uniform water application for gravity irrigation systems. It can increase efficiency, reduce erosion, and prevent water logging. Irrigation ditch lining is commonly used to deliver water to the system through permanent channels. Land leveling is essential for uniform water application in gravity irrigation systems, preventing puddles and dry spots. Irrigation ditch lining, made of materials like concrete or PVC, limits water loss during transit to the crop area. Canal linings can increase conveyance efficiency based on soil type and canal length. Irrigation ditch lining is installed to limit water loss during transit to the crop area. It can be made from materials like concrete, PVC, and polypropylene. Tailwater recovery involves reusing excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination and waterlogging of crops. Tailwater recovery involves reusing excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination and waterlogging of crops. An irrigation reservoir, which can be constructed using various methods like a dam, embankment, pit, or tank, provides a storage place for water to use for irrigation. The reservoir size depends on water availability and crop irrigation needs, and the water level can be maintained by surface or groundwater. An irrigation reservoir, constructed using various methods like a dam or tank, stores water for irrigation. Precision technologies like satellite data and drones have improved irrigation efficiency, reducing costs and increasing crop yield. The incorporation of precision technologies in agriculture, such as satellite data and drones, has rapidly increased in recent years, particularly in irrigation. These technologies enhance irrigation efficiency, reduce input costs, and boost crop yield. Technology companies are now offering services to help farmers maximize profits, with collaborative projects like the SMAP satellite mission between NASA and USDA. Technology companies are increasingly involved in the agricultural sector, offering services to help farmers maximize profits. The SMAP satellite mission, a collaboration between NASA and USDA, gathers soil moisture data globally without the need for terrestrial sensors. Despite the radar malfunctioning in 2015, the project continues using supplemental data and a functioning radiometer. This technology could benefit governments and agricultural producers. The SMAP satellite mission, a collaboration between NASA and USDA, collects soil moisture data globally without terrestrial sensors. Despite radar issues in 2015, supplemental data and a functioning radiometer have kept the project going. This data can help governments and farmers make informed decisions on irrigation. Drones and sensor networks can also aid in data collection and monitoring for better irrigation practices. Producers can use data from drones and sensor networks to inform irrigation decisions. Information gathered can be analyzed to adjust irrigation practices, improve efficiency, and automate irrigation systems. Sensor networks can monitor plant water status, evapotranspiration, and soil water content. Data analytics uses real-time data to improve decisions, including irrigation system automation based on gathered information. Regional weather data helps track crop evapotranspiration for establishing accurate irrigation schedules. The system automation adjusts water application based on data gathered from regional weather networks, precipitation, and soil moisture. A remote monitoring notification system wirelessly transfers real-time information to alter irrigation operations. Poly-pipe is used in furrow irrigation, and computer software is utilized for efficient irrigation management. The notification system wirelessly transfers real-time information to adjust irrigation operations, reducing field visits and water usage. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, optimized with computer software, decreases water application and runoff. Implementing irrigation BMPs increases efficiency and ensures even watering across fields, reducing production costs. The implementation of irrigation BMPs can optimize hole sizes for poly-pipe, reducing water usage and irrigation runoff. This increases irrigation efficiency, lowers production costs, and allows for higher yields and value crops. Irrigation can optimize field watering, leading to higher yields and value crops. It also reduces water application costs and prevents issues from overwatering. The controlled environment of an irrigation system can be used for applying other production-related inputs. Implementing irrigation systems can optimize field watering, reduce costs, prevent overwatering issues, and allow for precise application of nutrients and pesticides. Different irrigation technologies are used across the United States, with implementation choices sometimes limited by cost and crop type. Efficient irrigation systems can optimize field watering, reduce costs, and allow for precise application of nutrients and pesticides. Implementation choices vary in the United States based on factors like cost, crop type, climate, and water availability. Adoption of efficient irrigation technologies by agricultural producers is influenced by capital and operational costs. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors such as cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, technology requirements, and water quality. The adoption of these systems is driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation. Growers of high-value crops are more likely to invest in costly, efficient irrigation systems like drip irrigation, while growers of low-value crops are less inclined to do so. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems, such as drip irrigation, is driven by economic gains rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly systems, while low-value crop growers are less inclined to do so due to financial constraints. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, some growers cannot finance system improvements, and high-efficiency systems can be more costly than gravity systems. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, some growers struggle to finance irrigation system improvements, with high-efficiency systems like micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip being more costly than gravity systems. The cost of developing a water supply, including drilling wells and operating pumps, can also impact a producer's decision to adopt efficient irrigation systems. High-efficiency pressure systems in agriculture can be more costly than gravity systems like furrow irrigation. The cost of developing a water supply, including drilling wells and operating pumps, may influence producers' decisions. Groundwater supply development is generally more expensive than surface water, leading to the adoption of high-efficiency pressure systems in areas heavily reliant on groundwater. The cost of establishing a water supply from groundwater influences a producer's decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. High-efficiency systems are common in areas heavily reliant on groundwater, while areas with ample surface water tend to use gravity irrigation due to lower development costs. Growers in drought-prone regions relying on surface water are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems. Areas with adequate surface water supplies are less likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems due to low water development costs making gravity irrigation economically feasible. Growers in drought-prone areas relying on surface water are more inclined to adopt efficient irrigation systems, with the type of crop also influencing the choice of irrigation system. Perennial tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay, while close-growing crops like rice typically require gravity irrigation. Recent survey data shows that many farmers in the United States are unable to adopt more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, physical field conditions, and concerns about reduced crop yields or poorer crop quality. Local climate conditions also play a role in determining the type of irrigation system best suited for different crops. Many US farmers struggle to adopt efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, field conditions, and concerns about crop quality. Local climate also influences the choice of irrigation method, with drip and surface irrigation being more effective in windy conditions, while sprinkler irrigation is prone to evaporation in arid climates. Subsurface irrigation can lead to soil salinity issues. Local climate conditions, soil type, and crop evapotranspiration rates are key factors influencing the choice of irrigation system for agricultural producers. Windy conditions favor drip and surface irrigation over overhead sprinklers, while arid climates pose challenges for sprinkler irrigation due to high evaporation rates. Soil composition, such as sandy soils, may require specific irrigation methods like sprinklers or microirrigation. Soil salinity issues and climate conditions impact crop evapotranspiration rates, influencing the choice of irrigation system for agricultural producers. Soil type also plays a role in selecting the most suitable irrigation method. Sandy soils require sprinklers or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while loam and clay soils can accommodate various methods. Clay soils are best suited for gravity irrigation due to low infiltration rates. Soil surveys are used in irrigation water management planning to assess soil characteristics. Soil type influences the choice of irrigation method. Sandy soils need sprinklers or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while clay soils are best for gravity irrigation. Soil surveys help in planning irrigation water management. Labor-technology trade-off is important in selecting an irrigation system. The characteristics of soil in an area influence the choice of irrigation method. Gravity irrigation can be labor-intensive compared to pressure systems. Water quality and quantity also play a role in determining the type of irrigation system that can be used. The choice of irrigation method is influenced by soil characteristics. Water quality and quantity are also factors in determining the type of irrigation system. Water quality can dictate the system used, with sediment-heavy water best suited for gravity irrigation. Sprinkler or drip systems are better for managing salinity and selenium concerns. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, known as the Clean Water Act, addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water. While gravity irrigation is best for sediment-heavy water, sprinkler or drip systems are more effective for managing salinity and selenium issues. Agriculture benefits indirectly from the Clean Water Act's efforts to improve water quality. The Clean Water Act is the main law addressing water quality concerns in the nation's bodies of water. Agriculture indirectly benefits from these efforts, but water rights laws determine how much water is available for irrigation. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not discussed in detail in this report.
