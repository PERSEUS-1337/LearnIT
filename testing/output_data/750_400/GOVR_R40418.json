    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. The DOD, DHS, HHS, and USDA have expanded their laboratory capacity for studying dangerous pathogens, often referred to as high-containment laboratories. Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture are increasing laboratory capacity for studying dangerous pathogens in high-containment laboratories. These labs are crucial for biodefense efforts, but also pose a risk of materials or training being used for a biological attack. High-containment laboratories are essential for biodefense efforts, offering hope for better responses to biological attacks. However, they also pose a risk as a potential source of materials or training for such attacks. The federal government has invested in research to develop countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens usable in terrorist attacks, with funding increasing significantly from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008. The federal government invested in research to develop countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens potentially usable in a terrorist attack, with funding increasing significantly from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008. This funding supports academic and industrial researchers and laboratories handling dangerous pathogens, leading to concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited capacity. Non-federal entities have also expanded high-containment facilities. The influx of funds and researchers has raised concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited capacity. Non-federal entities have expanded high-containment laboratories due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity has raised new policy questions. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases has raised new policy questions regarding laboratory capacity, federal investment, consolidation, optimal size, and coordination of efforts among multiple agencies. The expansion of high-containment laboratories internationally has prompted policymakers to consider questions about capacity, federal investment, consolidation, optimal size, coordination of efforts, and balancing benefits with risks. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised concerns about the need for a coordinated plan, the potential risks of accidents or misuse, and the balance between benefits and risks. Policymakers are increasingly interested in tightening government oversight of these facilities following incidents of accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has led to concerns about accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tighter government oversight of these facilities. This report focuses on federal regulation of high containment laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts and discussing issues facing these facilities. This report focuses on the federal government's regulation of high containment laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts, discussing issues facing federal policymakers, and identifying policy options for congressional consideration. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens from theft or unauthorized access. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related, with definitions varying and sometimes overlapping. Biosecurity refers to securing pathogens from theft, while biosafety involves practices to lower infection risk. Practices and oversight mechanisms for biosecurity and biosafety have developed independently. The federal government created the Select Agent Program to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. The Select Agent Program was established by the federal government to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released, following the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The Select Agent Program, established following the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, regulates the transfer of organisms and toxins that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. The 2001 anthrax mailings led to increased government interest in bioterrorism threats, resulting in the enactment of laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposed stricter restrictions on the possession of pathogens. The 2001 anthrax mailings heightened government concern about bioterrorism, leading to the enactment of laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. These laws imposed stricter restrictions on the possession of select agents, requiring entities to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession and transfer. The Select Agent Program enforces restrictions on possession of pathogens and toxins with potential for malevolent use. Entities must develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. Scientists accessing select agents must register and undergo background checks by the Department of Justice. The Select Agent Program regulates access to select agents by requiring scientists to register with the federal government and undergo background checks. Facilities using select agents must have security plans in place to prevent theft or unauthorized access. Facilities handling select agents must develop and implement a security plan to protect them. Permits to handle select agents are nontransferable and valid for five years. The CDC and USDA review security plans for compliance and conduct inspections every three years. Failure to comply with regulations can result in consequences. The CDC and USDA review security plans for compliance and conduct inspections every three years. Failure to comply with regulations can result in fines. Possessing select agents without completing the security risk assessment process may violate federal law. As of February 2009, about 390 entities and 15,300 staff had approval to work with select agents. The majority of certified entities are owned by state or local governments, including public health laboratories. Violating Select Agent Program regulations can result in fines. In February 2009, 390 entities were certified to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff having security risk assessment approvals. The majority of certified entities are owned by state or local governments, particularly public health laboratories. The federal government established a Laboratory Response Network to enhance testing and response capabilities in the event of a biological attack. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network linking state or local public health laboratories to enhance testing and response capabilities following a biological attack. The goal is to establish a capable laboratory in each state for handling dangerous pathogens. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program regulations, which some view as too burdensome for research involving dangerous pathogens. The federal government aims to establish a laboratory in each state to handle dangerous pathogens. Tensions have increased in academia over the Select Agent Program regulations, leading to some entities transferring or destroying their select agent inventories. The program's performance has been scrutinized by agency Inspectors General. The Select Agent Program has faced scrutiny from agency Inspectors General, with investigations focusing on internal controls, processing of applications, and regulatory compliance. HHS IG found that many universities did not fully comply with select agent regulations. The HHS IG found that 11 out of 15 universities and 8 laboratories were not fully compliant with select agent regulations. Three entities withdrew their select agent licenses. The USDA IG also found incomplete controls over registered entities and their compliance with regulations. The USDA and HHS IGs found non-compliance with select agent regulations in various state, local, private, and commercial laboratories. Three entities withdrew their licenses. CDC suspended a certificate at Texas A&M University for failure to report exposures and allowing access to select agents without security assessments. Other entities have also faced citations and fines. In 2007, the CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University for failure to report occupational exposures promptly and allowing access to select agents without security risk assessments. Various organizations have been cited and fined for violations of select agent regulations, with fines totaling $1,887,000 levied on 12 organizations by the HHS OIG. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risks of contracting diseases and accidental pathogen release. Universities fined for select agent violations, HHS OIG fines total $1,887,000 on 12 organizations. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge risks and have developed best practices to mitigate them. Guidelines issued by HHS in Biosafety publication. In the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. government began issuing formal guidelines to mitigate the risks of releasing pathogens into the environment. The guidelines are disseminated by HHS in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), which outlines four main levels of biosafety (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents. Each biosafety level is associated with specific protections. The CDC and NIH have established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents in laboratories. Each level has specific physical and procedural protections, with higher levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are referred to as high-containment laboratories. The CDC and NIH have established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents in laboratories, with higher levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are known as high-containment laboratories, with guidelines developed by the DOD, HHS, and USDA to protect laboratory workers based on specific risks posed by pathogens. The BMBL guidelines were developed to protect laboratory workers in BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, based on specific risks posed by pathogens. They define biosafety levels, best practices for safe lab operation, and how to determine the appropriate level for each organism and procedure. Biosafety levels are linked to a combination of pathogen and experiment, not specific pathogens. The BMBL guidelines outline biosafety levels for laboratory operations, emphasizing the importance of matching the level to the specific pathogen and experiment. It includes primary and secondary infection barriers, standard and special lab practices, and recent security guidelines. Researchers and lab workers must adhere to these guidelines as per federal grant policy and standard contract language. The BMBL guidelines detail biosafety levels for lab operations, emphasizing matching levels to specific pathogens and experiments. It includes primary and secondary infection barriers, standard and special lab practices, and recent security guidelines. Researchers and lab workers must follow these guidelines as per federal grant policy and standard contract language. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, treatment, and the research activity being conducted. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in procedures outlined in the BMBL before accessing the laboratory. The appropriate biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, and the research activity. Procedures should be conducted at BSL-1 for those unlikely to cause disease, BSL-2 for those treatable with immunization or antibiotics, BSL-3 for those causing serious diseases, and BSL-4 for high-risk procedures. Procedures should be conducted at different biosafety levels based on the potential risk posed by the pathogen and procedure. BSL-1 is for pathogens unlikely to cause disease, BSL-2 for those treatable with immunization or antibiotics, BSL-3 for serious diseases, and BSL-4 for high-risk procedures. It is possible to handle deadly pathogens at lower biosafety levels with certain procedures. Procedures with high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted infections and life-threatening disease should be conducted at BSL-4. Pathogens posing the greatest health threat can be handled at lower biosafety levels for specific activities, such as handling anthrax at BSL-2 for activities using clinical materials. The BMBL recommends handling anthrax at BSL-2 for activities using clinical materials and at BSL-3 for work involving production quantities or high concentrations of cultures. BSL-4 containment is required for 13 out of 73 select agents and toxins, while 30 others can be studied at BSL-2 depending on the circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated. The BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may not always use select agents, and BSL-2 facilities have a small proportion falling under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is essential. Some BSL-3 facilities work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is typically voluntary but widely adopted as facility policy, with some mandatory requirements for federal contracts and grants. Noncompliance can lead to loss of federal funding. Some federal contracts and grants require compliance with the BMBL guidelines, with noncompliance potentially leading to loss of federal funding. Industrial, academic, and non-profit laboratories appoint health and safety officials to ensure the proper operation of protective equipment and ongoing compliance with guidelines. Some federal agencies mandate compliance with the BMBL in their laboratories. Health and safety officials in various types of laboratories ensure the proper functioning of protective equipment to comply with guidelines. Laboratories under the Select Agent Program must consider BMBL guidelines for security plans. The BMBL guidelines are also integrated into building design standards, grant requirements, and other federal regulations. Laboratories regulated under the Select Agent Program must follow BMBL guidelines for security plans and building design standards. These guidelines are also incorporated into federal requirements for DNA research and grant and contract requirements. Federal facilities and those built using federal funds adhere to design standards based on the BMBL guidelines. Federal facilities, including those built with federal funds, follow design standards based on BMBL guidelines for laboratories. Design specifications for NIH buildings include requirements for ventilation, utilities, and access controls, with security requirements specified separately. The BMBL design standards for federal facilities, including NIH buildings, specify requirements for ventilation, utilities, and access controls. NIH issues checklists for high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance before occupancy, a process known as certifying or commissioning. Other agencies also have similar processes in place. The NIH issues checklists for laboratory certification to ensure compliance with biosafety guidelines. Other agencies also have similar processes in place for certifying newly constructed or existing laboratories. The NIH and other agencies require compliance with biosafety guidelines for laboratory certification. Agencies contract out the commissioning process, with NIH recommending specialized individuals for the task. The NIH recommends specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, for commissioning laboratory facilities to ensure compliance with biosafety guidelines. Professional Engineers with extensive experience in designing, optimizing, remediating, and testing systems for laboratory facilities that receive federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines to maintain funding. Compliance is crucial as non-compliance could result in the withdrawal of existing federal funding and the withholding of future funding. As a funding condition, laboratories receiving federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL. Non-compliance could lead to the withdrawal of current funding and the withholding of future funding. Compliance with federal, state, and local health and safety standards should be demonstrated if requested by the awarding office. Grantees receiving federal funding must comply with biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL. Evidence of adherence to federal, state, and local health and safety standards may be required. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research typically mandate the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with guidelines. The IBC determines the appropriate biosafety level for novel research. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research often require the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with guidelines. The IBC has the authority to determine the biosafety level for research activities and can enforce specific biosafety precautions. Some suggest expanding the IBC's oversight to other research with biosafety concerns. The IBC has the authority to require specific biosafety precautions for recombinant DNA research activities. Some propose extending the IBC's oversight to other research with biosafety concerns, but concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the IBC mechanism for such responsibilities. The BMBL suggests that IBCs help scientists determine the appropriate level of protection for experiments, but some experts argue that the IBC mechanism lacks sufficient oversight. The Select Agent Program regulations require compliance with the BMBL guidelines for entities possessing select agents. The Select Agent Program regulations require compliance with the BMBL guidelines for entities possessing select agents, including the development of security and biosafety plans. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States is believed to have increased in recent years. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in BSL-4 space since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research, and a focus on public health and diagnostic capacity. The expansion of high-containment laboratory space in the United States has increased twelve-fold since 2004, driven by federal construction and funding for research activities. The federal government is investing in biocontainment laboratories across various departments. The government is funding the construction of high-containment laboratories across different departments, creating both government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense has maintained a high-containment laboratory infrastructure for many years. The federal investment in high-containment laboratories includes federally owned and operated facilities, as well as privately owned and operated ones. The Department of Defense has had high-containment laboratories since World War II, conducting both offensive and defensive research. President Nixon ended the U.S. offensive biological weapons program in 1969. The Department of Defense's high-containment laboratories have evolved since World War II, focusing on defensive research. President Nixon ended the U.S. offensive biological weapons program in 1969. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the sole DOD location with BSL-4 laboratory space. The Department of Defense's biological laboratories focus on defensive research, with USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, being the sole DOD location with BSL-4 laboratory space.

The DOD is expanding its facilities at USAMRIID with a $683 million expansion to increase BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space. Other DOD laboratories have also enhanced their containment capabilities since 2001 for research on infectious diseases and testing vaccines. The DOD is expanding its BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories for research on infectious diseases, vaccine testing, and bioforensic analysis under the Department of Homeland Security. The federal government established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center in 2004 under the Department of Homeland Security to analyze pathogens for identifying biological attack perpetrators. The center, currently located at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is constructing permanent facilities including a BSL-4 laboratory for bioforensic and biological threat assessment activities. The National Bioforensics Analysis Center, part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, is currently located at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD. Permanent facilities, including a BSL-4 laboratory and BSL-3 laboratories, are under construction and expected to be fully operational in 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center from USDA to DHS due to reaching the end of its usable lifespan. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) to DHS, which has reached the end of its usable lifespan. The DHS is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), a BSL-4 laboratory, to replace PIADC for research on animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The DHS is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas to replace the PIADC facility. The NBAF will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures at a BSL-4 laboratory. The DHS announced the decision to establish the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas, which will expand research capabilities for animal pathogens at the highest level of biocontainment. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains BSL-4 laboratories at NIH and CDC, and has invested in constructing BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) for national research and testing on pathogens. The Department of Health and Human Services has invested in constructing two BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and thirteen BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) to support research on pathogens. The NBLs and RBLs will serve as national resources for clinical and laboratory research, with the NBLs being built in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX. These facilities will also be available to assist public health efforts during bioterrorism or emerging infectious disease emergencies. The NBLs and RBLs are being constructed in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, respectively, to support research on pathogens. They will also assist in public health efforts during emergencies. The HHS has developed the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to maintain an integrated network of laboratories for public health activities. The RBLs are geographically dispersed throughout the United States and will be privately owned and operated. The LRN, developed by HHS, is a network of laboratories that can respond to bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, and public health emergencies. It includes federal and state public health facilities, medical institutions, and others primarily engaged in diagnostic and public health testing during emergencies. The LRN is an integrated network of laboratories that can respond to bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, and public health emergencies. These labs are primarily engaged in diagnostic and public health testing, especially in emergency situations where additional capacity is needed. The USDA is constructing new BSL-3 laboratories, including facilities in Ames, IA, for animal health research and product evaluation. The USDA is constructing new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA and Fort Collins, CO, while academic institutions are also investing in high-containment laboratory facilities in response to increased federal funding for biodefense research. Academic institutions are building high-containment laboratory facilities to increase their ability to compete for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Examples include the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University. The University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are examples of academic institutions constructing additional BSL-3 laboratory space to enhance their competitiveness for federal funding and faculty recruitment. Private sector companies also maintain high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing, animal studies, and product development. Some companies and non-profit institutions have high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing, animal studies, and product development. Companies may choose to have in-house facilities or contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of these laboratories raises issues for policymakers. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers, including determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, balancing desire for capacity with increased risk, international ramifications, and local concerns. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers realized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space. Congress and the administration decided to construct more facilities, with the understanding that federal investment and support were necessary due to high capital and maintenance costs. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for more high-containment laboratory space. Congress and the administration agreed to build additional facilities, requiring federal investment due to high costs. Decisions were made in various agencies and budget cycles without a comprehensive national needs assessment. The decision to build high-containment laboratories was made after the 2001 anthrax mailings, with a lack of national needs assessment leading to concerns of over-building capacity. Policymakers are concerned about the excess high-containment laboratory capacity without a coordinated expansion plan. Lack of information on existing laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 BSL-3 laboratories, while DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but the DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, drawing criticism from experts. The estimate was based on the number of facilities registered to work with select agents, but not all BSL-3 labs work with select agents. The DHS and HHS estimate of 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has been criticized by experts. Nongovernmental estimates show an increase in high-containment laboratory capability, with uncertainty about the exact number of BSL-3 laboratories documented by the Government Accountability Office. Entities registered to work with select agents may or may not use high-containment laboratories, with nongovernmental estimates showing an increase in capability. The Government Accountability Office documented an increase in BSL-3 laboratories, but the exact number remains uncertain. A government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies may be needed to determine if current and planned construction exceeds national needs. Previous attempts by a single agency to determine the number of existing laboratories have been unsuccessful, prompting Congress to consider conducting a survey. The construction of high-containment facilities is increasing, raising concerns about capacity utilization. Additional funding for research, operations, and management will be needed to fully utilize the increased capacity. Congress may need to consider a government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies to determine if construction exceeds national needs. The construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding. Agencies may struggle with funding increases when expanding their laboratory capacity. Expanding high-containment laboratory capacity can lead to challenges in securing funding, especially for agencies experiencing significant growth. Increased operational and maintenance costs accompany facility expansion, regardless of full capacity utilization. Agencies may seek larger research budgets to cover these costs, potentially necessitating interagency planning to address overcapacity expenses and facilitate shared facility use. Individual agencies may request larger research budgets to cover increased operations and maintenance costs. Interagency federal planning efforts could help reduce overcapacity costs, but require agreement on prioritization and shared facility use among agencies. However, planning efforts from individual agencies may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies. For instance, DHS has tried to coordinate homeland security research and development, but without addressing the use of other agency laboratory assets. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about coordination between agencies in utilizing high-containment laboratory space. Congress may need to decide on central coordination or agency-level coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about potential pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Congress may need to consider central coordination or agency-level coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. The expansion of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has sparked worries about pathogen release and biological weapon spread. Concerns include pathogen or knowledge transfer to foreign scientists, lab infections, and inadequate biosafety levels, prompting a reevaluation of oversight. Current self-regulation is deemed insufficient, with calls for stricter federal measures. Some analysts believe the current self-regulatory approach to overseeing high-containment laboratories is not stringent enough and requires additional federal oversight. Suggestions include mandatory biosafety training and broadening biosecurity measures, while others propose an enhanced self-regulatory approach focused on greater worker engagement. Some experts suggest expanding regulations for high-containment laboratories to include mandatory biosafety training and broadening biosecurity measures. Others propose a self-regulatory approach focused on greater worker engagement and responsibility, with increased training in best practices and self-policing by scientists. The expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity allows for a greater diversity of biodefense research, more efficient public health sample testing, and research discoveries. Legislation passed by previous Congresses addressed concerns about theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens in high-containment laboratories. Increased capacity allows for more research diversity and efficient testing, but also raises the risk of theft or misuse of technical knowledge. Increased capacity in high-containment laboratories for health sample testing and research discoveries has led to more facilities registering to possess select agents. Concerns about theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens have prompted legislation to enhance physical security measures. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses at some participating facilities. The Select Agent Program is being augmented to improve physical security of stored pathogens in high-containment facilities. Investigations have shown security weaknesses at some participating facilities, prompting a need for increased regulatory focus on compliance. The growing laboratory capacity may strain agency resources for these efforts. High-containment laboratories are designed to minimize accidents, but despite planning, they can still occur and overwhelm safety controls. The GAO has testified that each facility has inherent risks, which increase as more facilities are built. The GAO has testified that high-containment facilities have inherent risks that increase with the construction of additional facilities. Incremental risk is difficult to measure and may vary depending on compliance with best practices and regulations, including factors like accidental releases, subsequent illness rates, and the total number of laboratories. The incremental risk in high-containment laboratories is challenging to measure and varies based on compliance with regulations. Factors contributing to the risk include accidental releases, subsequent illness rates, and the total number of laboratories. Policymakers may conduct a cost/benefit analysis to estimate the potential benefits of research in these facilities versus the costs of an infectious release. Policymakers may perform a cost/benefit analysis to estimate the benefits of research in high-containment laboratories, such as biodefense breakthroughs, versus the costs of an infectious release, like the loss of infected animals or infection of lab workers. Other effects, like the development of a national sampling lab network, are harder to measure. Biodefense research in high-containment laboratories can have benefits like developing vaccines, but there are also costs such as the risk of infection. Federal policymakers may overlook subtle effects like the expansion of laboratory techniques. Concerns also include personnel surety and the \"insider threat.\" The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the \"insider threat\" as more individuals are trained in high-containment techniques, increasing the risk of malicious intent. The expansion of high-containment laboratories requires additional trained technicians, scientists, and employees. The risk of malicious intent increases as more people receive training in high-containment techniques. The DOJ believes the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist expert in high-containment technique. The increase in high-containment capacity may have international ramifications. The DOJ asserts that the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist expert in high-containment technique. The increase in high-containment capacity may have international ramifications, potentially leading other countries to suspect the U.S. of developing offensive biological weapons. This perception could harm U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention. The increase in high-containment capacity in the U.S. may lead other countries to suspect offensive biological weapons development, damaging efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention. This could also result in international proliferation of high-containment facilities, increasing the risk of malevolent use of training and information. The expansion of U.S. infrastructure may lead to the construction of similar facilities in foreign countries, increasing the international availability of high-containment techniques. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could influence business decisions of pharmaceutical companies. The differences in biosafety regulations among countries may impact the decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, potentially leading to the relocation of research and production facilities. This could have economic implications and affect national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of disease treatments may face challenges in accessing countermeasures during international health crises. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of treatments could face restricted access during international health crises. Governments may hoard domestically produced countermeasures to prioritize their residents. Governments may hoard domestically produced countermeasures during an international disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack, leading to potential barriers in international collaborations among scientists. This could impact industry decisions on research investments based on perceived biosecurity regulations between countries. The development of perceived barriers to international collaboration in scientific research may lead to industry investments in countries with lower barriers. The impact of biosecurity regulations on collaborations and research remains unclear, but U.S. standards could influence international partners to adopt similar policies. High-containment laboratories are being constructed in the United States. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced varying degrees of local resistance, with some groups supporting the building citing economic benefits and job creation. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has been met with varying degrees of local resistance. Some groups support the building for economic benefits and job creation, while others oppose it due to public health and quality of life concerns. Some groups support building high-containment laboratories for economic benefits and job creation, while others oppose it due to public health and quality of life concerns. Policymakers have options to address these issues, with expert panels currently examining the situation. In addressing concerns about high-containment laboratories, policymakers have options such as stepping up oversight or deferring action until expert panel reports are complete. The panels are currently examining issues related to high-containment laboratories, and Congress could defer additional action until their reports are complete. Alternatively, Congress could decide to increase oversight of facilities, pathogens, or personnel. Oversight efforts aim to balance security controls with research productivity, considering the potential trade-offs between additional oversight and scientific progress. One scientist highlighted the balance between security controls and research productivity, noting the opposition to measures that hinder scientific progress while reducing the threat of terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens. Policymakers may find current oversight sufficient for high-containment laboratories, with some in the scientific community supporting existing mechanisms without additional measures. There is strong opposition to measures that hinder scientific progress in high-containment laboratories. Some in the scientific community support existing oversight mechanisms without additional measures, arguing that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists is more effective than increasing lab security. Supporters of the status quo argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists and disrupting their activities is more effective than increasing security in high-containment laboratories. They suggest allocating resources to develop intelligence on bioterror groups for a lower cost than implementing a regulatory framework that affects domestic scientists. If current oversight efforts are deemed insufficient, additional measures may be necessary. Intelligence on potential bioterror groups, their needs, and social aspects could disrupt their activities at a lower cost than implementing a regulatory framework. Policymakers may defer action to understand policy options and impacts. The Bush Administration formed expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity issues since 2005. The Bush Administration formed expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity issues since 2005. Policymakers may defer action until expert groups complete their investigations and make recommendations. President Bush created the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States on January 9, 2009, through Executive order. Congress could endorse expert groups' activities while awaiting their recommendations on biosafety and biosecurity issues. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group includes various government officials and experts to address biosafety and biosecurity issues. Congress could explicitly support the group's efforts while awaiting their recommendations. Some policymakers may feel additional studies are necessary. The Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States was established by President Bush in 2009 through an Executive Order. It consists of various government officials and experts tasked with reviewing and evaluating existing laws and practices related to biosafety and biosecurity.

The Board has working groups producing analysis and recommendations. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with recommendations for legislative and executive branch action. Congress may choose to wait for these recommendations to avoid duplicating efforts or generating new policy ideas. Alternatively, Congress may decide high-containment laboratory issues are too urgent to wait for the results. Congress may consider waiting for recommendations from studies on high-containment laboratories to avoid duplicating efforts or generating new policy ideas. Alternatively, they may decide to address the issue without waiting for reports from the executive branch or GAO. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of these laboratories have been unsuccessful. Several policy options may facilitate addressing the issue of high-containment laboratories without waiting for executive branch or GAO reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of these laboratories have failed to produce a reliable inventory. Non-federal laboratories are scattered across various sources, making compiling a comprehensive inventory a challenging task. Determining the number of high-containment laboratories is a complex task due to their scattered locations in various types of facilities. Previous efforts to create a comprehensive inventory have been unsuccessful, with calls for a more thorough approach involving non-governmental organizations and congressionally established commissions. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to gather accurate information about existing facilities and their capacities. Non-federal high-containment laboratories are found in academic research institutions, public health agencies, and industrial facilities. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be enough to identify all existing facilities and their capacities. Concerns about industrial competitiveness and reporting burden could hinder obtaining a complete inventory. Incentivizing self-reporting efforts may increase participation. Efforts to incentivize self-reporting or mandate registration of all high-containment laboratories could help create a comprehensive list of facilities and their capacities. Industrial competitiveness and reporting burden may hinder obtaining complete inventory. Efforts to incentivize self-reporting or mandate registration of high-containment laboratories could create a comprehensive list of facilities and their capacities. Congressional policymakers could mandate registration to ensure all labs are accounted for, potentially providing valuable information to the government. A registry of high-containment laboratories could offer valuable information to the government, potentially including total capacity, current use, geographic distribution, and availability. Registration could be mandated for all labs, even without additional security measures. Alternatively, a survey could focus on federal facilities to ensure comprehensive reporting. The government could require certification of high-containment facilities and personnel, potentially through a registry or survey. Limiting the survey to federal facilities could provide policymakers with a clear understanding of existing capacity, allowing for more efficient planning and possible expansion. A government-wide needs assessment could also aid in efficient resource allocation. The government may require agencies to report their high-containment facilities and capacity to Congress for efficient planning and resource allocation. Comparing the needs assessment with existing federal capacity can help determine if there is an overexpansion, which could lead to resource allocation costs and security concerns. The government may need to assess high-containment facilities to allocate resources efficiently. Comparing needs with existing capacity can prevent overexpansion and security risks. Congress should consider the economic costs of surveying labs and the quality of information obtained. Comparing the survey results with needs can maximize benefits. In considering whether to survey high-containment laboratories, Congress should weigh economic costs under self-reporting and mandatory reporting frameworks. Comparing survey results with needs can maximize benefits. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new federally funded construction of such labs. In response to concerns raised by policymakers, some have proposed a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to assess the need for such facilities and avoid overbuilding. The proposal for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories aims to assess the need for such facilities and prevent overbuilding. Without a government-wide capacity needs assessment, building more labs may lead to redundancy and diminishing returns as capacity exceeds actual requirements. Policymakers must weigh the benefits of constructing the right amount of laboratory capacity against the potential costs to research and other priorities. The absence of a government-wide capacity needs assessment raises concerns about over-building new high-containment laboratories. Incremental increases in capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. Some agencies argue that interagency assessments have been conducted to address criticism. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may be more effective than constructing new laboratory space. Some agencies argue that existing infrastructure is outdated and not suitable for expansion, citing the need for a government-wide assessment to address specific agency needs. The government agencies have assessed interagency needs individually, noting that current infrastructure is outdated and not suitable for expansion. Without a government-wide assessment, potential synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. Implementing a construction moratorium could hinder the government's ability to achieve national goals, leading to delays in research activities. Enacting a construction moratorium could delay national goals like establishing a permanent bioforensics capability and expanding high-containment laboratory facilities. This may impede planned research activities and hinder the government's ability to meet established priorities. Delays in planned research activities due to construction moratorium could hinder national priorities like establishing a permanent bioforensics capability and expanding high-containment laboratory facilities. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with regulations. Some analysts propose licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with regulations, including applying Select Agent Program requirements to all facilities. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements, ensuring uniform security standards. Alternatively, a separately administered program could offer flexibility in licensing. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements, ensuring uniform security standards. Alternatively, a separately administered program could offer flexibility in licensing, but challenges may arise in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community. Licensing high-containment laboratories can be done by applying Select Agent Program requirements for uniform security standards or through a separate program for flexibility. Challenges may arise in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community. However, licensing and certifying high-containment laboratories may not cover all laboratories of concern, as select agents can be handled outside of high-containment facilities. A more comprehensive approach to oversight would involve regulating all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment, capturing all locations with sufficient biosecurity oversight. However, this approach would lead to overseeing a significantly larger number of facilities. A different approach to oversight could focus on expanding the select agent list to include pathogens of concern, rather than regulating all facilities capable of handling them. This would address the issue of increased oversight of numerous facilities, including public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Some experts suggest expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens not covered by the current regulations, such as SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever. This approach would focus on the pathogens of concern rather than the facilities capable of handling them. Some experts argue for expanding the select agent list to include dangerous pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever, which are not currently regulated. This would increase the number of high-containment facilities under the Select Agent Program. Scientists are concerned about the construction of the select agent list and potential resistance to its expansion. Some pathogens causing diseases like equine encephalitis and yellow fever are considered as biological weapons. Expanding the regulated pathogens list would increase the number of facilities under the Select Agent Program. Scientists are concerned about the current definition of select agents hindering research. The NIH has requested the National Academies to assess this issue. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Focusing on the Select Agent list would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, not other high-containment facilities. This approach aims to limit disruption of scientific research. The National Academies are working to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy, focusing on the Select Agent list to impact only entities using pathogens of concern. This approach aims to limit disruption of scientific research and public health activities by allowing regulatory efforts to focus on high-containment facilities posing the greatest risk. Background checks for personnel using BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded. The government may expand background checks for personnel using BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities to focus regulatory efforts on high-containment laboratories posing the greatest risk. These checks have similarities to security regimes for classified information access or positions of public trust. The government may expand background checks for personnel at high-containment facilities, such as BSL-4 facilities, to mitigate potential risks. The level of background screening required could vary based on policymakers' assessment of the risks involved. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, including potential resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may choose to leave research fields requiring high-containment laboratories rather than comply with the required government background screening. Efforts to improve personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may encounter challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may opt to leave research fields that require high-containment laboratories rather than undergo the necessary government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than those needed for access to select agents, but the effectiveness of personnel screening remains uncertain. Efforts to improve personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, including potential resistance to government clearance requirements. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than necessary for access to select agents. Despite increased oversight, a DOD scientist was involved in the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training tailored to individual needs, work tasks, and risks associated with select agents or toxins. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs, work tasks, and risks associated with select agents or toxins. Developing training standards could ensure core competencies are met, as some experts believe current biosafety training programs are insufficient to meet demand. The development of training standards for biosafety could help ensure core competencies are met, with some experts suggesting current efforts are insufficient. Training could range from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification, potentially reducing laboratory acquired infections. Efforts to expand biosafety training are necessary to meet current demand. Training could vary from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification. The impact of such training is challenging to evaluate, as it may reduce laboratory acquired infections, although the rate of these infections is lower than other injuries. However, solely focusing on biosafety training may not address biosecurity weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Including considerations for the dual-use nature of pathogens in high-containment laboratories could help address these concerns. Enhancing biosafety training to include considerations for the dual-use nature of pathogens in high-containment laboratories can address biosecurity concerns and promote a more uniform understanding among workers. Lessons from incidents in high-containment labs can provide valuable insights for improving response strategies. Reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, play a crucial role in learning from successes and failures in addressing unexpected events. In high-containment laboratories, addressing biosecurity concerns and promoting a uniform understanding among workers is crucial. Lessons from incidents can provide valuable insights for improving response strategies. Reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, play a crucial role in learning from successes and failures in addressing unexpected events. In high-containment laboratories, reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, are crucial for disseminating information about accidents or near accidents involving select agents. However, the fear of penalties or professional repercussions may deter researchers from reporting, hindering the improvement of practices to prevent future events. Enhancing the reporting system in high-containment laboratories could establish a database of accidents and remediation efforts to prevent future incidents. This could provide valuable warnings to scientists and improve safety practices. Some experts suggest improving the reporting system in high-containment laboratories by creating a database of accidents and corresponding remediation efforts. This database could provide warnings to scientists to prevent future accidents. Penalties for reporting accidents to this database should be minimized to encourage reporting. Congress may need to consider this mechanism. Experts recommend creating a database for reporting accidents in high-containment laboratories, with minimal penalties to encourage reporting. Policymakers must balance oversight with regulatory burden when designing such programs. Congress may need to consider the balance between oversight and regulatory burden in designing programs to encourage reporting of negligence in high-containment laboratories. Increased federal oversight may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders, but could help reduce opportunities for misuse of biological weapons. Increased federal oversight in high-containment laboratories may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders, but could help reduce opportunities for misuse of biological weapons. Expansion of the Select Agent Program may increase barriers to public health response and international collaboration. Critics argue that this could hinder the response to emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza. Expansion of the Select Agent Program, either by expanding the list or applying requirements to more labs, may hinder public health response and international collaboration for emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza. Critics argue that increasing the program's scope and certification requirements could impede successful collaboration, impacting public health response negatively. The Select Agent Program, including pathogens like SARS and avian influenza, relies on efficient material transfer between labs. Expanding the program may hinder collaboration and public health response. International collaboration on regulated pathogens could be impeded by differing security regimes in foreign countries. Licensing and certification requirements may have significant impacts on regulated entities. The impacts of licensing and certification requirements on regulated entities, including scientists not involved in biodefense activities, public health laboratories, and hospitals, may result in reduced scientific productivity and increased costs. Additionally, international collaboration on regulated pathogens could be hindered by differing security regimes in foreign countries. Scientists not involved in biodefense activities may be affected by licensure requirements, potentially reducing scientific productivity in academic and industrial sectors. Public health laboratories and hospitals could incur costs from regulatory activities. An increase in regulated facilities would necessitate more federal resources for registration, inspections, and oversight. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency is a key issue. Increased regulated facilities would require more federal resources for registration, inspections, and oversight. The challenge lies in identifying the most suitable oversight agency, with USDA and HHS being considered appropriate regulators due to their technical knowledge and relationship with the scientific community. Concerns historically focused on laboratory worker safety and pathogen accidental release, but now include homeland security issues like pathogen theft and training. The USDA and HHS are considered appropriate regulators due to their technical knowledge and relationship with the scientific community. Policymakers may consider DHS for homeland security concerns. Oversight could be performed by the agency with existing statutory authority or new authorities may be developed. The possibility of training someone with malicious intent has increased, leading policymakers to consider other agencies like DHS for oversight. If new authorities are developed, a mix of oversight may occur, with one agency regulating security under the Select Agent Program and another regulating high-containment laboratories. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones, including potential consolidation of oversight into one agency, is crucial. If new authorities are established, oversight may involve multiple agencies regulating security and high-containment laboratories. Harmonizing requirements and potentially consolidating oversight into one agency is essential for smooth implementation. Limited federal resources have been dedicated to overseeing biosafety practices, which are mainly voluntary. Expanding biosafety practices for high-containment laboratories may require increased federal resources. Expanding biosafety practices for high-containment laboratories may require additional federal resources and staffing to oversee new mandates. The 111th Congress is considering legislation addressing the Select Agent Program and the challenges posed by the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address the Select Agent Program and the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the program and expand criteria for select agents. Additional funding and staffing may be needed for agencies to meet new mandates. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization and expand criteria for select agents. They also require the National Academy of Sciences to review the program, mandate biosafety training for access to select agents, and improve monitoring and inventory procedures. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization and expand criteria for select agents. They require the HHS Secretary to develop mandatory biosafety training for access to select agents and issue guidance on monitoring and inventory procedures. Additionally, the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the USDA Secretary, must report to Congress on current and planned capacity, sharing of laboratory lessons, and improving guidance on laboratory infrastructure. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization and expand criteria for select agents. They require mandatory biosafety training for access to select agents and guidance on monitoring and inventory procedures. The HHS Secretary, in consultation with the USDA Secretary, must report to Congress on current and planned capacity, sharing of laboratory lessons, and improving guidance on laboratory infrastructure. Additionally, the HHS Secretary is directed to establish the Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for voluntary reporting of biosafety or biosecurity incidents. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance. It also requires a report detailing activities to integrate the RBL network. Additionally, a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System will be established for voluntary reporting of biosafety or biosecurity incidents. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs. It also requires a report on the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity in response to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. Biocontainment technologies are globally dispersed and used by scientists worldwide. The need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity in response to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies is being assessed to integrate the RBL network. International harmonization of biocontainment technologies is crucial to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being the source of bioterror weapons. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories. The challenge for congressional policymakers is to define the goal of enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories. This choice of goal may impact the importance of issues and policies to address them, such as implementing a registry for planning and coordination but with limited security benefits. Rigorous oversight programs including facility and personnel licensure and mandatory training are also important considerations. When considering policy options for oversight of high-containment laboratories, policymakers must balance security benefits with regulatory burden, cost, and impact on scientific progress in countermeasure research, bioforensics, and public health. Policy options for oversight of high-containment laboratories, such as personnel licensure, mandatory training, and restricted construction of new facilities, may offer security benefits but come with regulatory burden, increased federal expenditures, and hindered scientific progress in countermeasure research, bioforensics, and public health. Policymakers face the challenge of balancing these competing national needs when considering potential policy options."
