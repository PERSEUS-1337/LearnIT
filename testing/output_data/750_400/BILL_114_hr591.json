    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, enhance national security, and boost the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research and development to achieve breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can facilitate the development of tools and technologies for engineering biology through long-term research and development, as industry support alone is insufficient due to the distant or uncertain benefits. Multiple user facilities can be supported by the Federal Government to advance engineering biology. The Federal Government can play a crucial role in advancing engineering biology by supporting the development of tools and technologies through multiple user facilities. Other countries' investments in this field pose a risk to the United States' competitive edge, necessitating the need for a National Engineering Biology Initiative. A National Engineering Biology Initiative is crucial for the United States to maintain its competitive edge in the field, as other countries are heavily investing in engineering biology. This initiative can establish new research directions, improve coordination, drive technology transfer, and ensure optimal returns on the Federal investment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
