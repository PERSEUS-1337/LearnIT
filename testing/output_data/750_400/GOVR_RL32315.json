These restricted areas may still contain substantial oil and gas reserves. The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue addressed in legislation such as the omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and Senate substitute, S. 2095. The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue. Legislation such as the omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and Senate substitute, S. 2095, includes provisions to examine restrictions and impediments to oil and gas development on public lands. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands, reflecting Energy Task Force recommendations. Oil and gas development practices have sparked considerable debate in Congress. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands, reflecting Energy Task Force recommendations. Oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred to private ownership under the Mining Law of 1872, sparking debate in Congress. The Mining Law of 1872 allowed oil and gas resources on public lands to be transferred to private ownership, leading to debate in Congress. President Taft's actions in 1909 and the Pickett Act of 1910 addressed concerns about abuse of the law and wasteful use of public lands. President Taft's actions in 1909 addressed widespread abuse of the Mining Law, leading to the withdrawal of 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California. This resulted in the Pickett Act of 1910, which recognized executive branch authority for public land withdrawals. Congress later decided to keep defense-related minerals, including oil and gas, under federal ownership, leading to the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system that has generated billions in revenue for the federal government. This created a \"split-estate\" situation where minerals owned by the federal government under privately held lands. The federal government has raised billions of dollars in revenues from royalties, rents, and bonus bids through the leasing system. Various split-estate situations exist, such as surface and mineral rights held by different private interests. Federal statutes allow the government to issue patents to land while reserving the right to minerals, making the mineral estate dominant and the surface use servient. Specific policies and procedures must be followed by mineral estate holders. The federal government can issue patents to land while reserving mineral rights, making the mineral estate dominant. Specific policies must be followed by mineral estate holders for developing minerals, including obtaining consent from surface owners or paying for damages. About 11% of public lands are affected by split-estate situations. Environmentalists have supported public land withdrawals and restrictions due to concerns about inadequate environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 and Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. In Wyoming, 50% of lands are split-estate, while in Montana, it's about 57%. In Wyoming, 50% of lands are split-estate, while in Montana, it's about 57%. Environmentalists support public land withdrawals and restrictions due to concerns about inadequate environmental protection. Ranchers and other groups also express concerns about the impact of development on water and land. Development supporters argue that there are numerous environmental laws in place to regulate oil and gas development on public lands. Development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands, citing compliance with NEPA, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, and reclamation standards. The industry faces delays in drilling due to environmental reviews. The oil and gas industry must comply with environmental laws such as NEPA, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, and reclamation standards. Delays in drilling are caused by environmental reviews. The proposed energy bill addresses concerns over increasing domestic oil and gas supplies. The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill (H.R. 6) and S. 2095 aims to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas exploration. Environmentalists argue that this could harm the environment and limit other land uses. The proposed conference report aims to establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas exploration. Environmentalists are concerned about potential harm to the environment and restrictions on other land uses. The report has been approved by the House but faces opposition in the Senate. The conference report on oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands has been approved by the House but faces opposition in the Senate. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is pending action. The report discusses onshore oil and gas production, reserves, and their contribution to meeting U.S. energy demand. An Appendix provides historical background on land withdrawals and the role of the Bureau of Land Management. The report discusses onshore oil and gas production, reserves, and their contribution to meeting U.S. energy demand, including information on permitting. An Appendix provides historical background on land withdrawals and the role of the Bureau of Land Management in oil and gas development. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development through Resource Management Plans (RMPs). Tracts of land with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing quarterly, with drilling permits required after lease awards. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres, with a total of 18.6 million acres leased for oil and gas development. Industry has complained about the lengthy process of obtaining drilling permits for exploratory or production wells on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must consider environmental impacts during land-use planning when Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are developed and implemented for tracts or areas of public lands prior to development. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are required for public lands prior to development, covering diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. RMPs consider environmental impacts and needs of present and future generations, with impacts of various uses identified early in the process for equitable consideration. Resource Management Plans (RMPs) cover large areas, reflecting diverse land uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. They consider impacts early in the process, weigh benefits of public lands, and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Public participation is essential, and the BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing. The BLM's Resource Management Plans (RMPs) aim to weigh benefits of public lands and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Through the land-use planning process, the BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through quarterly auctions. The auctions aim to provide a \"fair market value\" return to the federal government for its resources. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 requires public lands to be offered for leasing through quarterly auctions by the BLM to the highest bidder. If no bids meet the $2/acre minimum, leases are offered noncompetitively. Tracts remain available for noncompetitive leasing for two years. The federal government offers oil and gas leases on public lands through quarterly auctions to the highest bidder. If no bids meet the $2/acre minimum, leases are offered noncompetitively for two years. Noncompetitive leasing can be obtained by the first qualified applicant with a nonrefundable application fee of at least $75. SIMO noncompetitive lease applications filed after the competitive lease sale are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM for exploration excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Permit applicants must file a notice of intent with BLM and follow specific practices outlined by the surface managing agency. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. The permittee must file a notice of intent with BLM and comply with specific practices outlined by the surface managing agency. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for further exploration, development, and production. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well on the leased land. The lessee has exclusive rights to explore, develop, and produce on leased land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, including a drilling plan and evidence of bond/surety coverage. The Secretary must approve a plan of operations for proposed surface-disturbing activities within the lease area. The APD form 3160-3 must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The surface use plan details drillpad location, construction, waste disposal, and reclamation plans. The BLM consults with the surface managing agency and notifies them within 5 days after a 30-day review period for the APD. The APD must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The surface use plan includes details on drillpad location, construction, waste disposal, and reclamation plans. The BLM consults with the surface managing agency and notifies them within 5 days after a 30-day review period for the APD. The application must be processed within a 35-day period, and can be approved, approved with stipulations, rejected, or delayed for additional analysis or information. The applicant is informed of the final action expected. The BLM processes drilling permit applications within a 35-day period, notifying the applicant of the results. The application can be approved, approved with stipulations, rejected, or delayed for further analysis. Delays in permit issuance are often due to the need to update outdated RMPs. In the region, it took an average of 137 days to approve an APD in 2002, up from 84 days in 2001. Delays in drilling permits are often due to the need to update outdated RMPs because of increased natural gas leasing and development. The need to update outdated RMPs is due to increased natural gas leasing and development, which may exceed old plan limits. BLM is currently revising several plans under FLPMA, section 1712, to develop, maintain, and revise land use plans with public involvement. According to the BLM, several land use plans are currently being revised under FLPMA, section 1712, with public involvement. Planning regulations require an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared under NEPA. Once a draft EIS is issued for public comment, an RMP can be approved by the BLM State Director and published with an EIS and record of decision filed with the EPA. The current planning regulations require preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs can take up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, whereas in the past they may have been in place for up to 20 years. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) testified that rewriting Resource Management Plans (RMPs) can now take up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The Association argues that RMPs now have a usefulness of seven years, whereas in the past they could be in place for up to 20 years. The rapid coalbed methane (CBM) development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in RMPs, with environmentalists advocating for updated plans to avoid outdated land management decisions. The rapid coalbed methane (CBM) development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in Resource Management Plans (RMPs). Environmentalists argue for updated plans to avoid outdated land management decisions, as the need for revised RMPs could delay site-specific analysis for drilling permits. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process. The BLM announced strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process by processing multiple permit applications together, implementing geographic area development planning, and establishing standard operating practice agreements with oil and gas operators. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the APD process, including conducting environmental analyses on multiple permit applications, implementing geographic area development planning, and establishing standard operating practice agreements with oil and gas operators. The availability of public lands for oil and gas leasing is categorized into lands open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, and closed to leasing. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the APD process for oil and gas operators. Public lands for leasing are categorized as open under standard terms, with restrictions, or closed due to withdrawals or environmental sensitivity. Areas closed to leasing include wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, and environmentally sensitive areas unlikely to reopen for oil and gas leasing. Some lands are closed pending land use planning or NEPA compliance, while others are closed due to federal land management decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites. Some restricted areas may be opened by future administrative decisions. A BLM study found that out of 700 million acres of federal subsurface minerals, approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those that are statutorily withdrawn. Approximately 182 million acres of federal subsurface minerals are subject to approval by the surface management agency and must not conflict with land designations and plans. Wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas, and roadless areas are examples of lands in this category. Mineral development on 182 million acres requires approval from the surface management agency and must align with land designations and plans. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions like no surface occupancy or timing limitations to protect wildlife. Many wildlife refuges are withdrawn from leasing, while public lands open to leasing may have restrictions like no surface occupancy, timing limitations, and controlled surface use to protect wildlife. Industry sources argue that some stipulations are so strict they effectively prevent oil and gas development, although development has still occurred under certain conditions. Industry sources argue that some lease stipulations are overly stringent, hindering oil and gas development, despite development occurring under certain conditions. Energy and mineral industry representatives claim federal withdrawals limit exploration and reserve base, with public lands unnecessarily withdrawn for preservation goals. The energy and mineral industry argues that federal withdrawals inhibit exploration and limit the reserve base, while environmental groups believe the withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil resources on public lands in the lower 48 states. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil resources on public lands in the lower 48 states, with 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region on public lands. About 40% of this amount is not accessible or is subject to lease stipulations and restrictions. According to the EPCA study, 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the Rocky Mountain region is on public lands, with about 40% of that amount not accessible or subject to lease stipulations and restrictions. The region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to increased interest in natural gas access, protection of public lands, and Bush Administration policies. The Rocky Mountain region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy. Recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the region, including studies by the National Petroleum Council (NPC) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EPCA Report focuses on five major geologic basins within the Rocky Mountain region. Comparing data from the EIA and NPC studies provides valuable insights into natural gas supplies in the region. The EIA and NPC studies focus on natural gas supplies in the Rocky Mountain region, with similar definitions of the region. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands available for development is comparable. The 1999 NPC study indicates a natural gas resource base of 335 in the region. The EIA and NPC studies show similar definitions of the Rocky Mountain region, with comparable amounts of natural gas available for development on federal lands. The 1999 NPC study estimates a natural gas resource base of 335 trillion cubic feet, while more recent EIA data suggests 293.6 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas resources. The EPCA study found 138.5 trillion cubic feet in major geologic basins in the region. Oil and gas reserves are not included in the EIA report. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas in major geologic basins in the Rocky Mountain region. The NPC and EIA studies show differences in the amount of closed and restricted natural gas resources, with 9% closed and 32% restricted according to NPC, and 11.5% closed and 37% restricted according to EIA. The NPC and EIA studies show similar amounts of closed and restricted natural gas resources, with 9% closed and 32% restricted according to NPC, and 11.5% closed and 37% restricted according to EIA. The difference lies in the open leasing percentages, with 60% and 51.5% reported by NPC and EIA respectively. This variation is likely due to a larger portion of proven reserves available for leasing, as indicated by the EPCA study finding 26 tcf of proven reserves on federal lands out of a total of 43 tcf in major geologic basins. The difference in open leasing percentages for natural gas between NPC and EIA reports is 60% and 51.5% respectively. This variation is likely due to a larger portion of proven reserves available for leasing, with 26 tcf of proven reserves on federal lands out of a total of 43 tcf in major geologic basins according to the EPCA study. The EPCA study found that 63% of natural gas reserves are open under standard lease terms, with potential for an increase if Rocky Mountain reserves were included. Oil resources in the Rocky Mountains are less significant for U.S. supply, with 600 million barrels falling under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, one-third of which have restrictions. The EPCA study found that oil resources in the Rocky Mountains are less significant for U.S. supply. About 600 million barrels are categorized as \"no access,\" while 3.2 billion barrels are available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. Additionally, 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The EPCA study estimates about 2.5 billion barrels of oil on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the U.S. The study shows similar rates of restricted access for natural gas compared to other reports. The NPC and EIA studies show that development of natural gas in restricted land use areas would likely face costly delays. The EIA suggests that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf of natural gas could become immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop. The EIA report suggests that relaxing development restrictions in restricted land use areas could potentially free up 80 tcf of natural gas, with 29 tcf immediately available with greater regulatory flexibility and 51 tcf becoming less costly to develop by removing certain lease stipulations. Environmental groups argue that these restrictions are ecologically necessary to protect the environment. The EIA report suggests that relaxing development restrictions in restricted land use areas could potentially free up 80 tcf of natural gas, with 29 tcf immediately available with greater regulatory flexibility and 51 tcf becoming less costly to develop. Environmental groups argue that these restrictions are ecologically necessary to protect the environment. The NPC study estimates that 41% of the total gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf as of 1999. Substantial oil and gas reserves are located on public lands. The NPC study estimates that 41% of the total gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf as of 1999. This region represents 37% of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas resource base in the United States. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant amount of natural gas reserves, with an estimated 37% of the total resource base in the United States. If the currently restricted 108 tcf of natural gas in the region were produced, it could meet about 15% of projected annual U.S. demand for 20-30 years. The Rocky Mountain region has an estimated 108 tcfof natural gas reserves, which could meet 15% of projected annual U.S. demand for 20-30 years if produced. The United States has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, according to The Wilderness Society. The Wilderness Society testified that the United States has sufficient natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with 1,351 trillion cubic feet of natural gas potentially available for future development. The Wilderness Society stated that the US has enough natural gas supply for the next 40 years, with 1,351 trillion cubic feet potentially available for future development, excluding restricted areas. The NPC report estimated that 16% of the 1,351 tcf of natural gas cited by TWS is subject to restrictions, with 70 tcf in the Rocky Mountains under restriction. The NPC proposes relaxing land-use constraints to allow for more drilling on federal lands. The NPC proposes relaxing land-use constraints in the Rocky Mountains to access 70 tcf of natural gas currently under restriction or lease stipulations. This would involve relaxing \"no surface occupancy\" designations and other restrictions to allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper suggests focusing on reserve categories for resource access restrictions to be considered only for the most viable resources. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper emphasizes focusing on reserve categories for resource access restrictions, particularly for the most viable resources. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, forecasted to decline by 0.4% annually. Total U.S. oil production was 1.9 billion barrels in 2002, forecasted to decline by 0.4% annually. Oil imports are estimated to make up nearly 65% of total U.S. supply in 2025. Natural gas production was 19.4 tcf in 2002, up from 17.8 tcf in 1993. Oil production from federal onshore leases accounted for 5.4% of all U.S. oil production in 2002. Oil production from federal onshore leases in 2002 was estimated at 5.4% of total U.S. oil production, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top three states for onshore federal oil production. This production has been in decline over the past decade, falling from 133.5 million barrels in 1992 to about 100 million barrels. Oil production from federal onshore leases has been declining over the past decade, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top three states for onshore federal oil production. U.S. natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections showing an increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are expected to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. U.S. natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections showing an increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are forecasted to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. LNG imports are projected to rise from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Canadian natural gas production for 2025 was adjusted downward due to declining gas production, increased domestic use in oil sands production, and less certain offshore supplies. LNG imports are projected to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands in the US has increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002, with New Mexico accounting for 50% and Wyoming for 35%. US natural gas production on public lands has increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002 from 1.7 tcf in 1993, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states in production, accounting for 85% of the total. The federal onshore share of total US domestic oil and gas production is not expected to change significantly in the near term. New Mexico and Wyoming are the top two states in natural gas production on public lands, accounting for 85% of the total. Federal onshore share of US domestic oil and gas production is expected to remain stable. US oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels and natural gas reserves were 187 tcf as of December 31, 2002, with Texas leading in both categories. The US oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with Texas leading in both oil and natural gas reserves. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, while U.S. production declined by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. The US oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels in the past 10 years, with production decreasing by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. Discoveries in 2002 were about 950 million barrels, indicating a potential decline in production over the long term. In 2002, oil discoveries were 6% over the annual average since 1976, with 950 million barrels found. The US has substantial oil reserves, but production is expected to decline long-term. EIA estimates 92 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil resources, with not all being recoverable. The EIA estimates that the US has 92 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil resources, with not all being recoverable. Additionally, US gas reserves have increased by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from about 9% in 1991. The United States has seen a 16.5 tcf increase in gas reserves since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have increased to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries were up 70% above the average since 1976. EIA estimates technically recoverable gas resources to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount of current proved reserves. The EIA estimates technically recoverable gas resources in the US to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount of current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land and may be available for exploration. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment records 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment in the Rocky Mountain West estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is classified as unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands make up 53.6%, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. The Rocky Mountain region has proven reserves of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas on public lands. Federal onshore oil accounts for 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands makes up 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, and undiscovered conventional natural gas resources are at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane is a significant portion of the undiscovered gas resources. Estimates by the EIA show federal onshore oil is 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands is 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, with undiscovered conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. Additionally, undiscovered unconventional natural gas resources are estimated at 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is natural gas trapped in water in coalbeds, with variables like coal depth and pressure affecting methane quantity. The estimate for undiscovered unconventional natural gas is 358.7 tcf. Coalbed methane gas is trapped in coalbeds and extraction involves removing water to release the gas, with concerns about groundwater contamination. To extract coalbed methane (CBM), water is pumped out of the coal to reduce pressure and allow the gas to flow. Operators may fracture coal formations to facilitate gas movement, raising concerns about groundwater contamination. Water quality varies, with options for disposal including surface discharge or subsurface injection. The USGS reports that water pumped out of coal beds for CBM production can vary in quality. Water can be discharged near the surface for reuse if fresh, or disposed of through subsurface injection or surface discharge. Concerns about water quality and disposal have increased with the growth of CBM production, which was incentivized by a tax credit in 1980. CBM production has significantly increased since 1991, with coalbed gas contributing about 8% of natural gas production in 2002. Water quality and disposal are key concerns in CBM production. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized CBM development, leading to a four-fold production increase since 1991. In 2002, coalbed gas accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the U.S. There were 10,000 CBM wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day, with leading producers in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. Production rates vary due to coalbed geology, with 39,000 new wells expected by 2010, 23,900 on federal land. In 2002, 18.8 tcf of natural gas was produced in the United States, with 10,000 CBM wells also producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Leading producers are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. DOE estimates 39,000 new wells by 2010, with 23,900 on federal lands. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the U.S. are classified as economically recoverable. CBM reserves in the United States are largely undeveloped, with only about 100 tcf of coalbed methane classified as economically recoverable out of an estimated 700 tcf. Coalbed methane proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, accounting for 10% of U.S. dry gas reserves. CBM reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with Colorado and New Mexico holding over half of the U.S. reserves. Wyoming and Utah also have significant reserves. In the Rocky Mountain region, coalbed methane reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with Colorado and New Mexico holding over half of the U.S. reserves. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, while the Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf. The San Juan Basin is the most productive coalbed methane reserve, containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, with 9% of U.S. production and 8% of reserves. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf, with the majority of production taking place on private lands. The Powder River Basin (PRB) has 39 tcf of CBM resources, with most production on private lands. Surface owners in Wyoming have concerns about compensation for damages from CBM production. Surface owners in Wyoming have concerns about compensation for damages from CBM production. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to address conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees. Environmental concerns about CBM production focus on land disturbance. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners in Wyoming. Environmental concerns about CBM production include land disturbance and water issues such as surface and ground water impacts. Major issues involve surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and water disposal. Production of CBM involves land disturbance and water issues, including surface and ground water impacts. It includes wells, access roads, power lines, compressor stations, and waste water impoundments. Major concerns are surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and water disposal. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM production is under scrutiny for its potential impact on underground drinking water. The EPA has concerns over the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing for CBM production due to its potential impact on underground drinking water. A draft EPA report found no evidence of contamination of drinking water wells from CBM hydraulic fracturing, but the EPA and major companies using diesel fuel entered into a Memorandum of Agreement in 2003. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing for CBM production due to potential water contamination. An agreement was made in 2003 to stop using diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation may prevent the EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing purposes. Dennis Hemmer from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality was involved in the issue. Proposed energy legislation (H.R. 6 and S. 2095) may prohibit EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing. CBM production can lead to water pollution as most water does not flow to surface supplies but seeps into underground aquifers. This results in wells used for drinking water becoming contaminated with sodium-tainted water. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality stated that water from CBM production often seeps into underground aquifers, potentially contaminating drinking water with sodium. In 2002, CBM production resulted in 602 million barrels of water discharge annually. Environmentalists are concerned about the impact on groundwater from unlined holding ponds used in the process. Environmentalists are worried about the environmental impact of coalbed methane (CBM) production, which discharges 602 million barrels of water annually. They are concerned about unlined holding ponds leaking into groundwater, leading to the depletion of underground aquifers, loss of natural vegetation, and harm to aquatic life in waterways receiving CBM water. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. warns about the negative effects of CBM production on wells, water sources, and wildlife habitats. BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells at a cost of $50,000 each plus $5,000 for monitoring equipment to address concerns over groundwater quality and quantity. The infrastructure required for CBM production may impact wildlife habitats. BLM mandates CBM producers to drill monitoring wells at a cost of $50,000 each plus $5,000 for equipment to monitor water quality and levels. Monitoring wells are required for every four townships with CBM leases, but not on private lands. In April 2002, IBLA invalidated three leases due to environmental concerns. The BLM mandates monitoring wells for CBM production to monitor water quality and levels. On private lands, monitoring wells are not required. IBLA invalidated three leases in April 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Supplemental EAs were prepared for the Powder River Basin to determine CBM development in approved leasing areas, allowing more drilling with new conditions. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw additional leases in June 2002 due to violations of an IBLA ruling from April 2002, which directed BLM to update a resource management plan before offering CBM leases. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw additional leases in June 2002 due to violations of an IBLA ruling from April 2002, which directed BLM to update a resource management plan before offering CBM leases. BLM did not proceed with lease sales on public lands with high CBM content, including the parcels in question, while the IBLA ruling was being interpreted. The case was dismissed in December 2003, and the Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM in June 2002 for violating an IBLA ruling to update the resource management plan before offering CBM leases. BLM halted lease sales on public lands with high CBM content, including the parcels in question, while the ruling was interpreted. The case was dismissed in December 2003, and the Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP. The DOI approved issuing permits in July 2003, anticipating 39,000 permits for new wells over 10 years. Oil demand is forecasted to rise 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports reaching nearly 65% due to faster consumption growth than domestic production. The DOI approved issuing permits in July 2003, anticipating 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. Oil demand is forecasted to rise 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports reaching nearly 65% due to faster consumption growth than domestic production. U.S. demand for natural gas is also expected to rise 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is uncertain due to restrictions. The Bush Administration is taking steps to ease these restrictions, but the level of opposition is unclear. Challenges have been reported regarding alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use policies. The Bush Administration is working to ease restrictions on domestic supply from public lands, but the level of opposition is uncertain. Challenges have been reported regarding alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use policies. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, with more wells and deeper wells being drilled. Unconventional natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region is forecast to increase. The Bush Administration is facing challenges regarding alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use policies on public lands. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, with an increase in drilling for deeper wells. Unconventional natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region is forecasted to grow, raising concerns about potential environmental damage from drilling and production. The Rocky Mountain region is expected to increase its share of natural gas production in the lower 48 states by 2025, with concerns about environmental damage from drilling. Meeting U.S. energy demand may involve a mix of domestic output and imports, with the region potentially accounting for 40% of U.S. natural gas production in 2025. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms are actively exploring worldwide for the best returns on their investments. The United States is likely to increase reliance on natural gas imports, primarily LNG from stable countries, and boost production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms globally explore for optimal returns on investments, considering factors like political stability, resource base, and financing. Public land use decisions must also weigh environmental and societal impacts. The United States is attractive for investment due to political stability and a significant resource base. When making public land use decisions, factors like environmental and societal impacts must be considered. The terms for competitive leases include maximum acreage limits, minimum bid amounts, and bond requirements. Noncompetitive leases have different terms, including higher maximum acreage limits and no minimum bid amount. The terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases on public lands include maximum acreage limits, minimum bid amounts, bond requirements, application filing fees, rentals, and royalties. The fee bond requirement for competitive and noncompetitive leases is $10,000. Rentals start at $1.50/acre for 1-5 years and increase to $2/acre each year thereafter. Royalty is a minimum of 12.5% of production value. The onshore leasing program generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. The onshore leasing program on U.S. federal lands generates annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. Revenues are distributed to states, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, and other designated programs, with Alaska receiving 90% of all revenues collected. Revenues from federal oil and gas leases are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. States, except Alaska, receive 50% of the revenues, while Alaska receives 90%. The number of federal oil and gas leases in 2001 was 23,000, covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, leading to the creation of other national parks by Congress. The National Park System (NPS) was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects on federal public lands. Yellowstone National Park, created in 1872, was the first public lands withdrawal for this purpose. Congress has since created other national parks regularly. The National Park System (NPS) was created in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects on federal public lands. Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872, was the first of many national parks. Early tensions arose between the NPS and the Forest Service due to differing philosophies on resource use and conservation. In the early days of the National Park System (NPS), tensions arose with the Forest Service (FS) due to conflicting philosophies on resource use. The FS focused on the greatest good for the greatest number of people, while conservationists promoted National Parks. The public lands withdrawal debate in the early 1900s questioned the Commander-in-Chief's authority to make withdrawal orders based on national security. Withdrawals were defined as actions that changed the designation of specific parcels. In the early 1900s, tensions arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests. The public lands withdrawal debate focused on the President's authority to make withdrawal orders based on national security, changing the designation of specific parcels of land. The President acted as the chief custodian of public lands with tacit approval from Congress. The President's authority to withdraw public lands from entry or location by the private sector was debated in the early 1900s. Presidents have historically reserved lands for various purposes, such as military reservations, under laws like the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. The President has the authority to withdraw public lands from entry or location by the private sector, historically reserving lands for various purposes like military reservations under laws such as the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. National monuments can be created by the executive branch through statutory delegation under the Antiquities Act. The President can reserve protected sites on federal lands containing historic landmarks and scientific objects under various acts like the Antiquities Act and the Taylor Grazing Act. The Organic Act and FLPMA were used to regulate and designate recreation areas. Under the Taylor Grazing Act, 140 million acres were withdrawn from homesteading laws to protect historic landmarks and scientific objects on federal lands. The Organic Act and FLPMA were used to regulate and designate recreation areas, with withdrawals possible by the executive branch or Congress. Congressional wilderness designations were later seen as essential to prevent administrative revocation. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act also withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use or development. Under FLPMA, withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or Congress. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use or development. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability, defining wilderness as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. The Wilderness Act mandates the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability, defining wilderness as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Congressional disposition determines resource use availability. Federal lands can only be designated as wilderness areas as per the Wilderness Act or by an Act of Congress. The Wilderness Act specifies that federal lands can only be designated as wilderness areas through the Wilderness Act or by an Act of Congress. Congress has the authority to withdraw public lands for purposes such as creating National Parks and wilderness areas. The executive branch can also use delegated power under the Antiquities Act and the Pickett Act. Congress may also withdraw specific resources like oil, gas, and minerals. The creation of National Parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges requires an act of Congress. The executive branch can use delegated power under the Antiquities Act and the Pickett Act. Congress may withdraw specific resources like oil, gas, and minerals. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, which established a federal land use management policy. The General Mining Law of 1872 removed oil, gas, coal, and similar minerals. Lands can be withdrawn from development under the \"general congressional\" withdrawal. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, which allows for public and congressional input in land use planning. FLPMA details procedures for sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, and exchanges of public lands, with withdrawals possible by the executive or Congress on a temporary or permanent basis. FLPMA outlines procedures for land use planning with public and congressional input. Withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent, requiring congressional approval for parcels over 5,000 acres. Proposed withdrawals must be submitted to Congress with a detailed report. FLPMA outlines procedures for land use planning with public and congressional input. Withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent, requiring congressional approval for parcels over 5,000 acres. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years, with a report explaining the reasons for the withdrawal, effects on the economy and environment, alternatives, consultation with other agencies, and geological/mineral potential of the areas proposed. FLPMA mandated a review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals.

FLPMA mandated a review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals. BLM continues to review approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, giving priority to about 26 million acres that are expected to be returned by another agency to BLM. BLM is reviewing 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres expected to be returned or become available for various uses. As of November 2000, 7 million acres have been reviewed, with withdrawals on over 6 million acres revoked if not meeting the compelling show of need criteria. As of November 2000, BLM had reviewed approximately 7 million withdrawn acres, mostly BLM and Bureau of Reclamation land, with withdrawals on over 6 million acres revoked due to lack of compelling need. Retention of a withdrawal requires a convincing show of need to the BLM Director, Secretary, and the public. The review process is ongoing to determine continued withdrawal or classification. The agency manager must convince the BLM Director, Secretary, and the public that there is no reasonable alternative to continued withdrawal or classification of lands. The review process is continuous over the next several years, supported by documentation under NEPA. Some lands may be developed for oil and gas resources, while others deemed unsuitable for mineral development will likely remain closed or restricted."
