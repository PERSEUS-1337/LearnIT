    "content": "The U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the controversial Clean Power Plan (CPP) in October 2017. The CPP aimed to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants but has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) proposed by the U.S. EPA in October 2017 aimed to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants but faced legal challenges and has not been implemented due to a stay issued by the Supreme Court in February 2016. Disagreements revolve around the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis, with stakeholders debating the rule's benefits outweighing the costs. The CPP established national CO2 emission rates under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d), giving states two compliance choices. States could demonstrate compliance through a \"rate-based\" approach. The EPA established CO2 emission rates for existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants, allowing states to choose between a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" compliance approach. This flexibility aimed to minimize costs and achieve emission reduction goals. The EPA's Clean Power Plan offered states flexibility in achieving emission reduction goals through a statewide emissions rate goal or a \"mass-based\" approach. The emission reductions achieved would depend on states' compliance methods and factors like fuel sources and electricity generation. EPA's 2015 regulatory analysis projected a 32% reduction in total emissions. The EPA's Clean Power Plan allowed states flexibility in reducing emissions through different compliance methods. EPA's 2015 analysis projected a 32% reduction in total emissions by 2030. The proposed repeal of the CPP signifies a change in the previous Administration's stance on the policy and legal issues. EPA's decision to repeal the CPP is based on a new interpretation of its authority under Section 111(d). The EPA projected a 32% reduction in power sector CO2 emissions by 2030 under the Clean Power Plan. The proposed repeal of the CPP signifies a significant change in the previous Administration's stance on policy and legal issues. EPA's decision to repeal the CPP is based on a new interpretation of its authority under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA, under the current Administration, determined that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) exceeds its legal authority under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act by setting CO2 emission goals for existing power plants that are difficult to achieve. The agency also estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal, which is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The EPA estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, which is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The benefit-cost analysis of the repeal reveals methodological changes that may impact how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations. The EPA estimated the benefits and costs of repealing the Clean Power Plan in 2015. The benefit-cost analysis of the repeal shows methodological changes that could affect how EPA calculates benefits and costs of other regulations. Members of Congress, including a group of 19 Senators, are interested in understanding the differences between the 2017 and 2015 benefit-cost comparisons. Members of Congress, including a group of 19 Senators, are interested in understanding EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. They are particularly concerned about the changes in benefit-cost comparisons between the 2017 and 2015 analyses, which could impact how federal agencies account for climate and human health benefits in future regulations. The EPA conducted an analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, highlighting changes in benefit-cost comparisons between 2017 and 2015. This analysis could influence how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits in future regulations. The EPA conducted an analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, focusing on changes in benefit-cost comparisons between 2017 and 2015. The report summarizes the analysis conducted by EPA, comparing the economic analysis of the 2017 proposed repeal with the approach used in developing the 2015 CPP final rule. It highlights three primary changes in the 2017 analysis, including the estimation of climate benefits. The report provides background on regulatory analysis requirements for executive branch agencies, compares EPA's 2015 and 2017 benefit-cost analyses, and discusses three primary changes in the 2017 analysis related to climate benefits, human health co-benefits, and energy savings impact. The curr_chunk discusses the estimation of climate benefits, human health co-benefits, and energy savings impact in EPA's benefit-cost analyses for regulatory actions like the Clean Power Plan. EPA follows Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 for preparing these analyses. For more details on the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, refer to CRS Report R44992 and CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10016. The EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for regulatory actions like the Clean Power Plan, following Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. E.O. 12866 directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. Executive Order 12866 replaced regulatory analysis directives with similar requirements, directing federal agencies to assess benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. Significant actions are those with annual impacts of $100 million or more, create inconsistencies, interfere with other actions, or materially alter budget impacts. The Executive Order 12866 directs federal agencies to assess benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. These actions are defined as rules with annual impacts of $100 million or more, creating inconsistencies, interfering with other actions, or materially altering budget impacts. Rules meeting the first condition are considered economically significant and require a detailed regulatory analysis. Rules meeting the criteria of materially altering budget impacts or raising novel legal or policy issues are considered economically significant and require a detailed regulatory analysis as per E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. OMB Circular A-4 elaborates on the principles for regulatory analysis outlined in E.O. 12866, defining a good regulatory analysis as one that states the need for the proposed action, analyzes alternative approaches, and assesses benefits and costs. It aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies. The OMB Circular A-4 outlines principles for regulatory analysis, including the need for proposed action, alternative approaches, and assessment of benefits and costs. It aims to standardize measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies, emphasizing that benefits should justify costs without requiring monetized benefits to outweigh costs. E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 emphasize the importance of regulatory analysis in determining if the benefits of an action justify the costs, without requiring monetized benefits to exceed costs. Quantified benefit and cost estimates may not capture all impacts, so agencies are directed to quantify whenever possible and identify important non-quantified impacts. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015, following E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 guidelines to quantify benefits and costs of economically significant regulations. EPA calculated state-specific emission impacts. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015, following guidelines to quantify benefits and costs of economically significant regulations. EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario, emphasizing that states could implement the CPP in various ways. EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario under the CPP. The analysis was considered illustrative, with potential impacts estimated using the Integrated Planning Model. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under two illustrative scenarios for the CPP using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs were based on the net change in capital investment and heat rate improvements at coal-fired units. EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan (CPP) using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). The costs included capital investment, heat rate improvements, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring expenses. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan (CPP) using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). This included capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring expenses. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the EPA using the IPM model to estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions and applying the social cost of carbon (SCC) to estimate the economic value of associated climate benefits. The EPA used the IPM model to estimate reductions in CO2 emissions and applied the social cost of carbon (SCC) to determine the economic value of climate benefits, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. Additionally, the agency estimated human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions. The EPA estimated the monetary value of impacts associated with changes in CO2 emissions, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. They also quantified human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions like SO2 and NOx, monetizing the benefits expected from reduced exposure to PM and ozone. The EPA quantified reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions as \"co-benefits\" of the CPP, monetizing human health benefits from reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a benefit-per-ton approach in three different regions. The EPA calculated the average benefit-per-ton estimate for PM and ozone reductions in three regions, representing the value of reducing premature deaths and illnesses. PM health effects accounted for most of the monetized health co-benefits estimates, with 98% from reductions in PM. The EPA analyzed the value of reducing premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to PM and ozone in three regions. PM health effects accounted for most of the monetized health co-benefits estimates, with 98% from reductions in PM-related premature deaths. The majority of the estimated PM health co-benefits came from reductions in SO2 emissions, accounting for 80-85% of the estimated dollar value of human health co-benefits in the scenarios analyzed for 2030. The majority of estimated PM health co-benefits came from reductions in SO2 emissions, accounting for 80-85% of the dollar value in scenarios for 2030. Ozone health effects contributed a smaller share, roughly 6-12% of the estimated health co-benefits. EPA proposed to repeal the CPP two years after its finalization under the Obama Administration. The EPA, under the Trump Administration, proposed to repeal the CPP two years after its finalization under the Obama Administration. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) requires EPA to adhere to the same rulemaking process regardless of whether the agency promulgates, revises, or repeals a rulemaking. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP and follow the same rulemaking process as when it was initially promulgated. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) mandates that EPA must follow the same process for promulgating, revising, or repealing a rule. The relevant requirements for the regulatory analysis include summarizing the data and specifying the methodology used. The proposed repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation of Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, leading to a revisit of the 2015 CPP regulatory analysis due to its economic significance. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP based on a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act. A regulatory analysis was prepared in accordance with E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 to assess the costs and benefits of the repeal. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed CPP repeal, defining benefits as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone reductions in CO2. The EPA defined the benefits of the proposed CPP repeal as avoided compliance costs, while the costs were defined as forgone reductions in CO2 and non-GHG emissions, along with associated climate and health co-benefits. EPA used existing power sector projections for the analysis and plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM. The EPA used existing power sector projections to estimate the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal of the CPP. They plan to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The benefits were defined as avoided compliance costs, while the costs were the forgone reductions in CO2 and non-GHG emissions, along with associated climate and health co-benefits. EPA did not conduct new power sector modeling for the 2017 analysis but used two existing power sector projections to estimate the benefits and costs of the repeal. The EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal of the CPP. Benefit-cost estimates were based on power sector modeling results from 2015 and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. The EPA used power sector projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017 to estimate compliance costs and emissions reductions under the CPP mass-based scenario for monetizing avoided costs and benefits of the proposed repeal. The EPA utilized data from the Annual Energy Outlook 2017 to estimate compliance costs and emissions reductions under the CPP mass-based scenario for monetizing avoided costs and benefits of the proposed repeal. Additionally, the EPA revised the accounting treatment of cost savings from demand-side energy efficiency measures, now counting them as a positive benefit of the CPP. In 2017, EPA changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from energy efficiency measures, now considering them a positive benefit of the CPP. This shift led to less favorable benefit-cost comparisons compared to the 2015 analysis. EPA concluded that the monetized benefits of the CPP outweighed the costs in 2015, but the 2017 analysis presented a different perspective. The EPA's 2015 analysis found that the benefits of the CPP outweighed the costs, with net benefits ranging from $25 billion to $45 billion in 2030. However, the 2017 analysis showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons due to a change in accounting treatment for cost savings from energy efficiency measures. The 2017 analysis showed varying net impacts of the proposed repeal, ranging from net costs to net benefits. Estimates for 2030 ranged from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits. The agency's view was not explicitly stated in the 2017 analysis. The 2017 analysis presented a range of net impacts for the proposed repeal, with estimates for 2030 ranging from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits. The agency did not explicitly state its view on whether the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. The agency did not explicitly state its view on whether the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. Benefit-cost estimates from AEO 2017 projections showed a range of net costs and benefits for the proposed repeal. Half of the comparisons showed net benefits, while the other half showed net costs. The estimates are generally in the same order of magnitude as those in Table 1, but not directly comparable. The AEO-based benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The effect of updated power sector projections on the benefit-cost estimates is unclear. EPA noted that the estimates based on its 2015 power sector modeling did not provide a clear view on whether the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. The AEO-based estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. EPA noted that the benefit-cost estimates did not reflect recent changes in the power sector, such as shifts in electricity demand, growth in renewable energy generation, and changes in fuel prices. The AEO 2015 power sector modeling did not account for changes in electricity demand, renewable energy growth, retirements of older units, fuel prices, and regulations. AEO 2017 projections showed a shift to lower-emitting sources, potentially impacting CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA did not specify if these trends would affect benefit-cost comparisons. The AEO 2017 projections indicated a shift towards lower-emitting sources, potentially affecting CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal, with projections suggesting greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits. The EPA plans to update its power sector modeling for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal. AEO 2017 projections showed higher human health co-benefits due to greater SO2 reductions under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. Studies have observed a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030 relative to EPA's 2015 estimates. One recent study by Resources for the Future analyzed the AEO 2017 projections by fuel type and found a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030 compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. The study highlighted uncertainties in the differences between models used in the 2015 regulatory impact analysis and the 2017 AEO projections. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by updating estimates of the SCC. EPA made significant changes to its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs in comparison to the 2015 analysis. This included revising estimates of the SCC, excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits more strongly, assuming no human health co-benefits below pollution thresholds, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits rather than costs. The EPA made changes to its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs, including revising estimates of the SCC, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits more strongly, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes accounted for differences in conclusions between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. The EPA made changes to its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs, including revising estimates of the SCC. Typically presented as dollars per metric ton of CO2 in a given year, the SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions. The SCC is used by federal agencies to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions from rulemakings. It estimates the monetary impacts of changes in CO2 emissions, including agricultural productivity, flood risk, and energy system costs. SCC values are calculated using models to translate emission changes into economic impacts. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using four SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG), measuring the global value of CO2 reductions at $17, $53, $77, and $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 (2011$). In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using four SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG), measuring the global value of CO2 reductions at $17, $53, $77, and $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 (2011$). The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017. In 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates and disbanded the IWG as part of a broader executive order, E.O. 13783, which directed federal agencies to review certain federal requirements with respect to domestic energy development. E.O. 13783 specifically mentioned the need for agencies to ensure that new estimates are consistent with OMB Circular A-4. The Trump Administration disbanded the IWG and withdrew its SCC estimates as part of E.O. 13783, which directed agencies to review federal requirements for domestic energy development. E.O. 13783 emphasized the need for agencies to align new estimates with OMB Circular A-4, which focuses on domestic benefits and costs using discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA developed new interim SCC values without specific guidance from Circular A-4. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using models and assumptions similar to the IWG but with different discount rates and scope. Circular A-4 does not address issues like climate change or explicitly reference the SCC. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using models and assumptions similar to the IWG but with different discount rates and scope. Specifically, EPA approximated the domestic SCC as 10% of the global SCC based on a peer-reviewed paper by the DICE 2010 model. EPA used two models to calculate domestic SCC estimates, adjusting global values to domestic values based on a peer-reviewed paper. The interim SCC estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs, contributing to global concentrations and impacting climate and economies. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values in 2010. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs, impacting global climate and economies. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values in 2010. EPA agreed with the rationale in 2015. The IWG recommended global SCC values in 2010, stating that GHGs cause damages worldwide. EPA agreed in 2015, noting the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Some stakeholders supported using global SCC estimates. The United States operates in a global economy with interconnected spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health, justifying the use of global SCC estimates. Stakeholders argue that a domestic SCC would underestimate benefits due to climate impacts beyond U.S. borders. Some emphasize the need for a global SCC based on economic, strategic, ethical, and legal justifications. SCC would understate benefits to the United States due to spillover effects from climate impacts outside U.S. borders. Recommendations for a global SCC highlight the interconnected nature of climate change impacts, with no clear distinction between domestic and global effects. Stakeholders in 2015 suggested using domestic SCC estimates, aligning with OMB Circular A-4 guidance to focus on domestic benefits. Some stakeholders recommended using domestic SCC estimates in 2015, aligning with OMB Circular A-4 guidance to focus on domestic benefits and costs. Others questioned the use of global SCC values for U.S. climate regulations, stating that it may overstate the benefits of country-specific actions. Some stakeholders criticized using global SCC values for U.S. climate regulations, stating that it may overstate the benefits of country-specific actions. EPA pointed to E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4 to explain its focus on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal. SCC overstates benefits of country-specific rulemaking by including non-U.S. populations. EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in 2017 analysis, citing E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4. Circular A-4 allows consideration of global values but emphasizes benefits to U.S. citizens and residents. Circular A-4 allows consideration of global values but emphasizes benefits to U.S. citizens and residents. EPA presented global estimates in a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, without comparing them to the avoided costs of the proposed repeal. Developing accurate estimates of the domestic SCC poses challenges, as discussed by EPA in 2017. The EPA presented global estimates in a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, without comparing them to the avoided costs of the proposed repeal. Challenges in developing accurate estimates of the domestic SCC were acknowledged, including the difficulty in capturing relevant regional interactions. The EPA and NAS noted challenges in estimating the domestic social cost of carbon (SCC) due to the complexity of capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 provides discount rate recommendations for benefit-cost analysis. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) and OMB Circular A-4 provide recommendations for estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC) and selecting discount rates for benefit-cost analysis. NAS highlighted the challenges in capturing regional interactions for SCC estimation, while OMB Circular A-4 recommends discount rates of 3% and 7% based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% discount rate, known as the \"consumption rate,\" is based on the average saver's rate of discounting future consumption. It reflects the real rate of return on long-term government debt. The 7% rate is based on the opportunity cost of capital and corresponds to the growth rate of federal spending. The 3% rate, known as the \"consumption rate,\" is based on the real rate of return on long-term government debt. The 7% rate is based on the opportunity cost of capital and corresponds to the growth rate of federal spending. Discounting allows for comparisons of economic impacts over a long time period. Discounting in the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation allows for comparisons of economic impacts occurring at different times. It involves estimating climate change impacts to 2100 and beyond, then discounting the future value of those impacts to the year of CO2 emission. The selection of a discount rate is crucial due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change, affecting how the current generation values these impacts. The selection of a discount rate for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. The current generation must choose a discount rate on behalf of future generations without their input, raising questions about accounting for future preferences. The selection of a discount rate for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation is crucial for addressing climate change impacts on future generations. The current generation must decide on a rate without input from the future generation, raising questions about considering their preferences. Different discount rates impact present values differently, with higher rates leading to lower values and lower rates to higher values. SCC estimates are highly sensitive to the chosen discount rate. The selection of a discount rate for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation is crucial for addressing climate change impacts on future generations. Higher discount rates result in lower present values, while lower discount rates result in higher present values. SCC estimates are highly sensitive to discount rate selection, with intergenerational rates in the 1990s ranging from 1% to 3%. OMB Circular A-4 recommends considering sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates due to ethical implications of comparing benefits and costs across generations. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates are sensitive to discount rate selection, with intergenerational rates in the 1990s ranging from 1% to 3%. OMB Circular A-4 recommends conducting sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates due to ethical implications. The Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama Administration suggested lowering the 3% rate based on more recent market data. The Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama Administration recommended lowering the 3% discount rate to at most 2% and reducing the 7% rate as well. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental and public interest groups advocating for lower rates or rates that decline over time. The council recommended reducing the 3% rate to 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have varied opinions on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups suggesting higher rates. Studies show a preference for lower discount rates in climate change research. The literature and studies recommend lower discount rates for climate change impacts, with rates not exceeding 5%. The Interagency Working Group (IWG) suggested discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 3% for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), based on consumption rates rather than the 7% rate tied to the opportunity cost of capital. In 2010, the IWG recommended discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), aligning with the average saver's consumption rate. EPA supported these rates in the 2015 CPP analysis, citing consistency with economic literature and OMB Circular A-4 guidance. The NAS proposed a new method for calculating discount rates for the federal government. The NAS recommended a new approach for calculating discount rates for the federal government, emphasizing the need to capture uncertainty over long periods of time. They suggested that the OMB Circular A-4 guidance is insufficient for choosing SCC discount rates. The NAS recommended a new approach for federal agencies to calculate discount rates that better capture uncertainty over long periods of time, criticizing the OMB Circular A-4 guidance as insufficient. EPA estimated lower climate benefits of a proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates compared to their 2015 analysis. The EPA estimated lower climate benefits of a proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, which produced notably lower benefit estimates than their 2015 analysis. The use of a 7% discount rate in the 2017 analysis lowered the SCC estimates and reduced the estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. EPA valued CO2 emissions in 2015 and 2017 analyses but used lower SCC values in 2017, reducing climate benefit estimates under the CPP. Limitations of interim SCC estimates were acknowledged, leading to a sensitivity analysis with global values and alternative discount rates. EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on the proposed repeal, using global values and an alternative discount rate. The agency did not directly compare the sensitivity analysis estimates to the avoided compliance costs. EPA's 2017 analysis excluded forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on the proposed repeal, using global values and an alternative discount rate. The analysis excluded forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA conducted benefit-cost comparisons for the proposed repeal, excluding forgone health co-benefits in some analyses. One comparison focused solely on CO2 benefits, deviating from OMB guidance. The EPA conducted benefit-cost comparisons for the proposed repeal, excluding forgone health co-benefits in some analyses. One comparison focused solely on CO2 benefits, deviating from OMB guidance by not considering all health co-benefits that exceeded the threshold. EPA explained this approach as a way to focus on the benefits due to reductions in the target pollutant relative to the costs. EPA conducted benefit-cost comparisons for the proposed repeal, focusing on reductions in the target pollutant relative to costs. They emphasized the importance of evaluating regulatory actions based on targeted pollutants and requested public input on this approach. Stakeholders' concerns about co-benefits were also addressed. The EPA requested public comment on the consideration of benefits versus costs in decision-making processes for regulations targeting pollutants. Stakeholders raised concerns about co-benefits, such as reduced exposure to PM, and questioned potential double counting of benefits in regulatory analyses. Stakeholders criticized EPA's 2015 analysis of regulations targeting pollutants, questioning the inclusion of monetized co-benefits and potential double counting of benefits. EPA clarified that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations of PM and emissions. The EPA's 2015 analysis included human health co-benefits that were incremental to existing regulations of PM and emissions, in line with federal guidance to consider co-benefits in benefit-cost analysis. The OMB Circular A-4 and EPA's Guidelines emphasize the importance of quantifying and monetizing co-benefits and adverse impacts in rulemaking. EPA's Clean Air Act analyses include co-benefits in total benefits estimates, as reported in OMB's recent reports to Congress on federal regulations. Preparing Economic Analyses recommends that the agency's economic analysis should include intended effects, costs, ancillary benefits, and costs. OMB's recent reports to Congress noted that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter, following standard accounting practices required by OMB Circular A-4. The OMB noted that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses include co-benefits from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter, following standard accounting practices required by OMB Circular A-4. EPA applied a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. The EPA applied a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. The 2017 analysis diverged from past practice by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts based on the federal air quality standard for PM. EPA used thresholds to calculate PM mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons. One threshold was based on the federal air quality standard for PM, while the second was based on the \"lowest measured level\" of PM from long-term studies. EPA assumed no deaths below these thresholds. The EPA used thresholds to estimate PM mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons. One threshold was based on the federal air quality standard for PM, while the second was based on the \"lowest measured level\" from long-term studies. EPA assumed no deaths below these thresholds, impacting co-benefit estimates. The EPA used thresholds based on PM air quality standards and \"lowest measured level\" from studies to estimate mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons. The PM air quality standard threshold had a greater impact on lowering co-benefit estimates compared to the LML threshold, affecting the benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. The EPA used thresholds based on PM air quality standards and \"lowest measured level\" from studies to estimate mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons. The comparisons favored the proposed repeal when using the PM air quality standard threshold but were less favorable when using the LML threshold. EPA aimed to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty of estimated PM benefits at lower levels. EPA used thresholds based on PM air quality standards and \"lowest measured level\" to estimate mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons. The comparisons favored the proposed repeal with the PM air quality standard threshold but were less favorable with the LML threshold. EPA aimed to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty of estimated PM benefits at lower levels, referencing previous analyses of PM-related health risks. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing peer-reviewed studies and the NAS. Scientific evidence does not provide a clear threshold, but the agency has more confidence in estimates within observed PM concentrations. EPA acknowledged uncertainty in setting a threshold for PM concentrations based on scientific evidence and peer-reviewed studies. The agency's 2009 assessment supported a no-threshold model for PM-mortality relationship, while the 2015 analysis noted lower confidence in benefits at lower PM concentrations without applying a threshold. The EPA's 2015 analysis found that a no-threshold model best represents the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. It acknowledged lower confidence in benefits at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold. The federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free,\" indicating some risk of adverse health effects even at levels meeting the standard. EPA's 2015 analysis found that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free,\" indicating some risk of adverse health effects from pollution meeting the standard. The analysis included benefits above and below the standard levels, consistent with scientific evidence. EPA's 2017 analysis sought feedback on estimating and reporting PM impacts and planned further research to evaluate associated uncertainties. EPA's 2017 analysis discussed estimating and reporting PM impacts, intending to evaluate the uncertainty of the benefit-per-ton approach compared to other techniques in the literature. Further research will include detailed air quality modeling to inform threshold-based analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis compared the benefit-per-ton approach to other techniques in the literature for estimating health impacts of changes in pollutants like PM. They intend to conduct detailed air quality modeling to inform threshold-based analysis. EPA also changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit in their 2017 analysis. In their 2017 analysis, EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit, citing OMB guidance. This adjustment increased both estimated costs and benefits by the same amount. In the proposed repeal analysis, EPA removed energy savings from the total cost estimate. In their 2017 analysis, EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit, citing OMB guidance. This adjustment increased both estimated costs and benefits by the same amount. In the proposed repeal analysis, EPA removed energy savings from the total cost estimate, resulting in a larger cost estimate and added the energy savings to the estimated benefits, resulting in a larger benefits estimate. EPA moved energy savings from the cost savings estimate to the forgone benefits estimate. In their 2017 analysis, EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit, increasing both estimated costs and benefits. In the proposed repeal analysis, EPA shifted energy savings from the cost estimate to the benefits estimate, resulting in higher estimates of costs and benefits. The accounting change in the proposed repeal analysis increased both the estimated costs and benefits of the CPP. This change became more significant in the cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771, which specifies offsetting new incremental costs associated with regulations. EPA presented the results of this analysis separately from the benefit-cost comparisons. In a cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771, EPA reported cost savings of the proposed repeal but omitted the forgone benefits. The analysis calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033. The EPA's cost analysis under E.O. 13771 reported cost savings from the proposed repeal but did not mention the benefits of regulation. The analysis calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033, excluding demand-side energy efficiency savings. The EPA's cost analysis under E.O. 13771 reported cost savings from the proposed repeal for 2020-2033, excluding demand-side energy efficiency savings. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options. The EPA's benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating the potential effects of regulatory options, considering qualitative impacts not captured in monetized estimates. The EPA's benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options, considering qualitative impacts not captured in monetized estimates. Decisionmakers consider various factors such as legal considerations, technical feasibility, statutory criteria, and ethical considerations when developing regulatory proposals. EPA based the proposed CPP repeal on a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act. When developing regulatory proposals, decisionmakers consider legal, technical, statutory, and ethical factors. For example, the EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a legal interpretation change. Quantifying benefits and costs involves complex tasks drawing on scientific data and ethical decisions. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of a proposed regulation can be complex, drawing upon scientific data from multiple disciplines and involving ethical or policy-based decisions. EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal show how changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence the estimation of benefits and costs. EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis reached different conclusions than the 2015 analysis due to changes in policy priorities and technical information. The 2015 CPP and 2017 proposed repeal analyses demonstrate how changes in policy priorities and technical information can impact benefit and cost estimations. EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis differed from the 2015 analysis mainly due to changes in estimating economic impacts, such as using new SCC estimates and thresholds that affected climate and human health benefit estimates. Members of Congress hold varying views on EPA regulatory policy. The 2015 analysis showed changes in estimating economic impacts, including new SCC estimates and thresholds affecting climate and human health benefits. Congress has differing views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations like the CPP repeal proposal. Regulatory decisions like the CPP can impact major industries and public health. The report discusses how EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. Regulatory decisions like the CPP repeal proposal can impact major industries and public health. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. The 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates developed in response to E.O. 13783, which characterized the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates as \"no longer representative of governmental policy.\" The interim SCC estimates generally followed the IWG's methodology except for the scope of the estimates and discount rates. The interim SCC estimates, developed in response to E.O. 13783, differed from the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates in scope and discount rates. The use of a domestic perspective and a 7% rate lowered the interim SCC estimates, reducing the estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to consider potential differences across federal agencies due to the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates. The domestic perspective and use of a 7% rate lowered the interim SCC estimates, reducing estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to consider potential differences across federal agencies in their decisions on GHG-related regulations due to the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates. EPA's 2017 analysis provided few details about next steps for the SCC and implications for other federal analyses. The withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates may lead to differences in GHG-related regulations across federal agencies. EPA's 2017 analysis lacked details on future steps for the SCC and its impact on other federal analyses. It remains uncertain if other agencies will adopt the same interim estimates. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has already taken a similar approach. The impacts of climate change in the U.S. can be assessed using the best available science and economics, but a timeline for updates was not provided. It is unclear if other agencies will use the same interim estimates in their regulatory analyses. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has followed a similar approach as the EPA. The Department of Energy continued to use the IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking, even after the Administration withdrew those estimates. Congress may consider if EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis will influence future air pollution rulemakings. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Department of Energy have used different approaches in regulatory analyses. Congress may need to consider the impact of EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis on future air pollution rulemakings. EPA's 2017 analysis reflected different policy determinations compared to the 2015 analysis, particularly in terms of human health co-benefits. The EPA's 2017 analysis on human health co-benefits for air pollution rulemakings differed from the 2015 analysis, using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts and excluding health co-benefits in one analysis. The 2017 EPA analysis on human health co-benefits for air pollution rulemakings used a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts and excluded health co-benefits in one analysis, departing from previous approaches."
