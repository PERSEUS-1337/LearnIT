    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with most individuals facing capital charges unable to afford their own attorney and no state meeting ABA standards for indigent prisoner counsel. The American Bar Association (ABA) sets standards for the appointment, performance, and compensation of counsel for indigent prisoners. Evidence shows that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to certain racial and ethnic groups, with African-Americans making up a significant percentage of those executed and on death row. African-Americans account for a disproportionate percentage of those executed and on death row in the United States. Studies show that they make up a significant portion of defendants selected for capital prosecution. Studies have shown racial disparities in death penalty cases, with a high percentage of white victims and a majority of defendants selected for capital prosecution being African-American or Hispanic American. The General Accounting Office reported evidence of racial disparities in charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death penalty. In 1990, the General Accounting Office reported racial disparities in the death penalty system, with restrictions on prisoner appeals increasing the risk of wrongful imprisonment and execution. Since 1990, restrictions on prisoner appeals have increased the risk of wrongful imprisonment and execution, with the Supreme Court limiting death row prisoners' rights to appeal convictions and sentences in Federal courts. Legislation in 1996 further restricted Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners. The Federal Government and States are prohibited from carrying out the death penalty until Congress reviews the final findings and recommendations of the National Commission on the Death Penalty. This moratorium will remain in place until legislation is enacted based on the Commission's guidelines and procedures.
