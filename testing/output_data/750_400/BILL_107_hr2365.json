    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for powering the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, a competitive electricity market, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, currently generating over half of US electricity, is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the country. Coal, accounting for over half of US electricity generation, is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the country, with enough supply to last 250 years at current usage rates. Investments in emissions control technology for electricity generating facilities have been made over the past 30 years. Investments in emissions control technology for coal-based electricity generating facilities have reduced pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years, despite a nearly tripled use of coal for electricity generation. Continuous improvements in efficiency and environmental performance are possible for these facilities. Investments in emissions control technology for coal-based electricity generating facilities have reduced pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance from these facilities can allow continued use of coal and preserve energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%. Investments in emissions control technology for coal-based electricity generating facilities have reduced pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can effectively eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%, but there are risks associated with the initial commercial deployment in a competitive electricity market. Continued environmental improvement in coal-based generation through research and development is crucial. Investments in emissions control technology for coal-based electricity generating facilities have reduced pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years. New coal generation technologies can improve efficiency by up to 50%, but there are risks in the initial commercial deployment in a competitive market. Continued research for near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to the goals set under section 4.

The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, will provide Congress with a report every two years identifying technologies and assessing costs for achieving specified goals. The report will identify technologies and assess costs for achieving specified goals, recommend technology development programs for the Department of Energy to carry out in cooperation with industry. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, will provide Congress with a report every two years identifying technologies and assessing costs for achieving specified goals. Recommendations for technology development programs to achieve cost and performance goals will be developed in cooperation with industry. Additional authorities required to achieve the goals will also be recommended. The Secretary will work with industry to develop technologies that meet cost and performance goals, and will seek expert advice from relevant entities. Recommendations for additional authorities needed to achieve goals will be provided. The Secretary will conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies to achieve cost and performance goals under various Acts. SEC. 7 authorizes $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This funding is separate from existing authorizations and does not cap Department of Energy fossil energy research. SEC. 8 introduces the Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants, including coproduction plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. New technologies may also be included. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants, including coproduction plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness well beyond current standards. The plan to carry out the initiative will be transmitted to Congress within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will transmit a plan to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment, outlining program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies. The Secretary will submit a plan to Congress within 120 days of the Act's passage, detailing program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies, including efficiency improvements for coal-based electric generation units. The Act requires coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts to achieve efficiency improvements or enhance environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide control. The Act mandates efficiency improvements or environmental enhancements for coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts, including significant improvements in environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide control. This involves utilizing new alternative technologies at a lower cost than existing technologies. Additionally, it encourages recycling or reusing significant resources. The Act mandates efficiency improvements or environmental enhancements for coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts, including significant improvements in environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide control, nitrogen oxide, or mercury. It also encourages recycling or reusing a significant portion of coal combustion or gasification wastes. The Act requires coal-based electric generation units to make efficiency improvements and environmental enhancements, including capturing and reusing carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
