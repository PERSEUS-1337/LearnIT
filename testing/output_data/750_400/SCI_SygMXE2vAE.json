To address this, a layer-wise analysis of BERT's hidden states is presented, focusing on the valuable information contained in these states rather than just attention weights. The analysis specifically looks at BERT models fine-tuned for Question Answering tasks to understand how token vectors are transformed. Our analysis delves into the hidden states of BERT models fine-tuned for Question Answering tasks, emphasizing the valuable information contained in these states. Through probing tasks, we uncover the transformations of token vectors to find answers, offering insights into BERT's reasoning process. The analysis focuses on the transformations of token vectors in BERT models for Question Answering tasks, revealing insights into the system's reasoning process and ability to incorporate task-specific information. Fine-tuning has minimal impact on semantic abilities, and prediction errors can be identified in vector representations of early layers. BERT models go through phases related to traditional pipeline tasks, incorporating task-specific information into token representations. Fine-tuning has little impact on semantic abilities, and prediction errors can be detected in vector representations of early layers.

Tasks include Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification. The study in Beijing, China from 3rd-7th, 2019 focuses on language understanding tasks like Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification. Named Entity Labeling involves predicting entity categories from token spans. Coreference Resolution requires the model to handle coreference tasks.

Named Entity Labeling involves predicting entity categories from token spans, Coreference Resolution requires predicting if two mentions refer to the same entity, and Relation Classification predicts the relation type between two entities. The tasks were modeled and constructed by BID34 using annotations from OntoNotes 5.0 corpus and samples from SemEval. The Coreference task involves predicting if two mentions in a text refer to the same entity, built from the OntoNotes corpus and enhanced with negative samples by BID34. Relation Classification predicts the relation type connecting two known entities, constructed by BID34 using samples from the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset.

Relation Classification predicts the relation type connecting two known entities, constructed by BID34 using samples from the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset. Question Type Classification is essential for identifying question types in the Edge Probing task using the Question Classification dataset constructed by Li and Roth based on the TREC-10 QA dataset. The Question Classification dataset by Li and Roth BID18, based on TREC-10 QA dataset BID37, contains 500 types of questions. The model uses the whole question as input with its question type as a label. Extracting Supporting Facts is crucial for Question Answering tasks, especially in multihop cases. A probing task is constructed to identify Supporting Facts using BERT's token transformations to distinguish important context parts. BERT's token transformations are examined to understand how they distinguish important context parts from distracting ones in the extraction of Supporting Facts for Question Answering tasks. A probing task is created to predict if a sentence contains supporting facts for a specific question or if it is irrelevant, testing the hypothesis that token representations contain information about their significance. HotpotQA and bAbI datasets provide information on sentencewise Supporting Facts, aiding in this analysis. The model predicts if a sentence contains supporting facts for a question or is irrelevant. HotpotQA and bAbI datasets provide information on sentencewise Supporting Facts. SQuAD considers the answer-containing sentence as the Supporting Fact and excludes single context sentences. Probing tasks are constructed for each dataset to assess their ability to recognize relevant parts. The model predicts sentence relevance as supporting facts for questions. Probing tasks are created for each dataset to evaluate their ability to identify relevant information. Input tokens are embedded using a fine-tuned BERT model for all layers. The input tokens for probing tasks are embedded using a fine-tuned BERT model for all layers. Only tokens of \"labeled edges\" within a sample are considered for classification, which are then fed into a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier. The concept of Edge Probing involves using the output embedding from the n-th layer to classify tokens of \"labeled edges\" within a sample. These tokens are pooled and fed into a two-layer MLP classifier to predict label-wise probability scores. This process is applied to pretrained BERT models without fine-tuning to understand the model's learning abilities.

The HotpotQA task involves 112,000 question-answer pairs designed to combine information from different parts of a context, with an average context size of 900 words. The focus is on the distractor-task of HotpotQA, which includes both supporting and distracting facts. The HotpotQA task involves 112,000 question-answer pairs designed to combine information from different parts of a context. The context includes supporting and distracting facts, with an average size of 900 words. To accommodate the input size restriction of the pre-trained BERT model, the amount of distracting facts is reduced by a factor of 2.7. Additionally, yes/no questions are excluded from the analysis. The bAbI tasks are artificial toy tasks developed to understand neural models' abilities. The bAbI tasks are artificial toy tasks designed to test neural models' abilities in reasoning over multiple sentences. These tasks differ from other QA tasks in their simplicity and artificial nature. The 20 bAbI tasks test neural models' abilities in reasoning over multiple sentences, including Multihop QA, Positional Reasoning, Argument Relation Extraction, and Coreference Resolution.

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and learning rate scheduling are tuned through grid search. Models are trained for 5 Epochs with evaluations every 1000 iterations. The input length is set to 384 tokens for bAbI and SQuAD tasks, and up to 512 tokens for HotpotQA tasks. Different models are evaluated, including single-task and multitask models. The evaluation includes models trained on single bAbI tasks and a multitask model for all 20 tasks. Two settings are considered: Span prediction and Sequence Classification. Span prediction requires appending all possible answers to the context for HotpotQA tasks. In the HotpotQA dataset, two tasks are distinguished: HotpotQA Support Only (SP) task uses only Supporting Facts as the question context, simplifying the task and improving token vector distinction. The HotpotQA Distractor task is closer to the original HotpotQA task.

The HotpotQA Distractor task includes distracting sentences in the context but within the 512 token limit. Training results show that the model performs close to human accuracy on the SQuAD task. The task is similar to the original HotpotQA task, with distracting sentences included in the context but within the 512 token limit. Evaluation results show that the model performs close to human accuracy on the SQuAD task, while tasks derived from HotpotQA are more challenging. GPT-2 performs better on the bAbI task but worse on SQuAD and HotpotQA. The tasks derived from HotpotQA are more challenging, with the distractor setting being the most difficult. GPT-2 performs significantly worse on SQuAD and HotpotQA but considerably better on bAbI, reducing the validation error to nearly 0. BERT's error in the bAbI multi-task setting mainly comes from tasks 17 and 19, which require positional or geometric reasoning. GPT-2 shows improvement in reasoning capabilities compared to BERT in these tasks. In the bAbI multi-task setting, GPT-2 improves on BERT's reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks 17 and 19 which require positional or geometric reasoning. Qualitative analysis of vector transformations reveals recurring patterns, presented with samples from SQuAD and bAbI datasets. Probing task results are compared in FIG1.

The text discusses patterns in vector transformations in different BERT models with varying layers, showing phases in answering questions across diverse QA tasks. Early layers group tokens into topical clusters, with resulting vector spaces similar to Word2Vec embeddings and low task-specific information. In BERT-based models, early layers group tokens into topical clusters similar to Word2Vec embeddings, lacking task-specific information. Middle layers show clusters of entities less connected by topical similarity. In BERT-based models, initial layers show low accuracy on semantic probing tasks. BERT's early layers act as implicit replacements for embedding layers. Middle layers of neural networks display clusters of entities connected by their relation within a specific input context, rather than topical similarity. These task-specific clusters include question-relevant entities, as seen in a cluster with words like countries, schools, detention, and country names. The middle layers of neural networks display clusters of entities connected by their relation within a specific input context. These task-specific clusters include question-relevant entities, such as a cluster with words like countries, schools, detention, and country names. One cluster helps answer the question about common punishment in the UK and Ireland, while another cluster aids in identifying facts about Emily being a wolf and wolves being afraid of cats. The highlighted cluster in the neural network model identifies Emily as a wolf and shows a relation between them. The cluster also includes mentions of wolves. This demonstrates the model's ability in Named Entity Labeling and Coreference Resolution. The neural network model identifies a relation between Emily and the entity Wolf, including mentions of Wolves. The model's ability in Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, and Relation Recognition improves in higher network layers, as shown in FIG7. The model's ability in Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, and Relation Recognition improves in higher network layers, as shown in FIG7. Recognizing coreferences or relations are more difficult tasks that require input from additional layers until the model's performance peaks. These patterns are observed in both BERT-base and BERT-large models. Matching Questions with Supporting Facts is crucial for Question Answering and Information Retrieval, traditionally achieved by filtering context parts based on their similarity to the question. BERT models transform tokens to match question tokens with relevant context tokens, crucial for Question Answering and Information Retrieval. This behavior is observed in both BERT-base and BERT-large models, with some samples showing this in lower layers. The BERT models transform tokens to match question tokens with relevant context tokens, crucial for Question Answering and Information Retrieval. Results from probing tasks show that the models excel in distinguishing relevant information from irrelevant information in their higher layers. Performance for this task improves over successive layers for SQuAD and bAbI datasets. The BERT models excel in distinguishing relevant information from irrelevant information in their higher layers, as shown in probing tasks. Performance for this task improves over successive layers for SQuAD and bAbI datasets. However, the fine-tuned HotpotQA model does not show a significant increase in accuracy compared to the model without fine-tuning, indicating a limitation in identifying the correct Supporting Facts. The fine-tuned HotpotQA model in FIG2 shows less distinctiveness and lower accuracy compared to the model without fine-tuning. This limitation explains why the BERT model struggles with identifying the correct Supporting Facts. Vector representations help in understanding which facts are considered important by the model, improving transparency in decision-making. In the last network layers, the model isolates correct answer tokens and potential candidates, enhancing answer extraction. In the last network layers, the model dissolves previous clusters and separates correct answer tokens from the rest, forming homogeneous clusters. The vector representation at this stage is task-specific and learned during fine-tuning, leading to a performance drop in general NLP tasks. This loss of information is especially observed in the large BERT model fine-tuned on HotpotQA. The vector representation in the last network layers is task-specific and learned during fine-tuning, leading to a performance drop in general NLP tasks. This loss of information is especially observed in the large BERT model fine-tuned on HotpotQA. The model dissolves previous clusters and separates correct answer tokens, forming homogeneous clusters. Analogies to Human Reasoning can be made in the phases of answering questions. The large BERT model fine-tuned on HotpotQA shows a performance drop in general NLP tasks. Analogies to Human Reasoning can be made in the phases of answering questions, including semantic clustering, building relations between context parts, separating important from irrelevant information, and grouping answer candidates. The first phase of semantic clustering in BERT represents basic language knowledge, while the second phase involves building relations between context parts. Separating important from irrelevant information and grouping answer candidates are also part of the process, similar to human reasoning. BERT can process all input at once, allowing for concurrent phases depending on the task. FIG7 illustrates the overlapping tasks during the answering process. BERT differs from human reasoning in the order of processing steps, as it can see all input parts at once and run multiple processes concurrently. Comparing BERT to GPT-2, one major difference is that GPT-2 focuses more on the first token of a sequence in its hidden states. In comparing BERT to GPT-2, a major difference is that GPT-2 pays particular attention to the first token of a sequence in its hidden states, leading to a separation of clusters during dimensionality reduction. This phenomenon occurs in all layers of GPT-2 except for the Embedding Layer, the first Transformer block, and the last one. During dimensionality reduction, GPT-2 separates clusters based on the first token of a sequence, except for certain layers. The first token is masked in further analysis to address this issue. GPT-2, like BERT, distinguishes between relevant Supporting Facts and questions in the vector space. Additionally, it identifies sentences with similar meanings that are not Supporting Facts. In dimensionality reduction, GPT-2 masks the first token to address clustering issues. GPT-2, similar to BERT, separates Supporting Facts and questions in vector space. It also identifies sentences with similar meanings. The analysis extends beyond BERT to other Transformer networks. Future work will involve more probing tasks to confirm these findings.

Future work will involve more probing tasks to confirm these findings. Visualizations can reveal failure states and the difficulty of specific tasks through hidden state representations. Visualizations can reveal failure states and the difficulty of specific tasks through hidden state representations, answering questions of when, why, and how the network fails. For wrong predictions, the phases center on the wrong answer if the network has confidence in it. When the network makes wrong predictions, the phases focus on the incorrect answer if the network is confident in it. Inspecting early layers can provide insights into why the wrong candidate was chosen, such as selecting the wrong Supporting Fact or misresolution of coreferences. When the network makes wrong predictions, early layers can reveal insights into why the incorrect answer was chosen, like selecting the wrong Supporting Fact or misresolution of coreferences. Low network confidence results in little transformation in token clusters, often leading to irrelevant extractions. When network confidence is low, transformations in token clusters are minimal, leading to irrelevant extractions. Fine-tuning has little impact on the core NLP abilities of the model. The network maintains semantic clustering even when confidence is low. Fine-tuning has minimal impact on core NLP abilities as the pretrained model already contains sufficient information. The pretrained model retains key information about words and their relations, making it effective in various tasks. Fine-tuning involves minor weight adjustments without significant loss of previously learned encoding, explaining the success of Transfer Learning. Positional embedding is crucial for Transformer network performance, addressing a key difference with RNNs. The Transfer Learning approach is successful because the pretrained model retains key information about words and their relations. Positional embedding is crucial for Transformer network performance, addressing a key difference with RNNs. The effects of positional embedding are maintained even into very late layers depending on the task, as shown in visualizations on the SQuAD dataset. The visualizations support the importance of positional embedding in Transformer networks, showing its effects even in late layers on the SQuAD dataset. Fine-tuning on SQuAD improves the model's ability to resolve question types, leading to better performance from layer 5 onwards. The performance curves show that fine-tuning on SQuAD enhances the model's ability to resolve question types, leading to improved performance from layer 5 onwards. Conversely, fine-tuning on bAbI tasks results in a loss of ability to distinguish question types, likely due to the static structure of bAbI samples. The model fine-tuned on bAbI tasks loses the ability to distinguish question types due to the static structure of the samples. Fine-tuning on HotpotQA does not improve performance compared to the model without fine-tuning. This suggests that BERT-large is pre-trained to recognize question types. The study provides insights into Transformer networks' inner workings. The study reveals that the model fine-tuned on HotpotQA does not outperform the model without fine-tuning, indicating that BERT-large is pre-trained to recognize question types. Qualitative analysis shows interpretable information in Transformer models' hidden states. The qualitative analysis of token vectors in Transformer models reveals interpretable information stored within hidden states. This information can help identify misclassified examples, model weaknesses, and important context for decision-making. Future work can focus on developing methods to further process this information. The text discusses how token vectors in Transformer models can reveal important information for decision-making, such as identifying misclassified examples and model weaknesses. It also suggests that lower layers may be more suitable for certain problems in Transfer Learning tasks, and proposes further research on skip connections in Transformer layers for information transfer between non-adjacent layers. The text suggests that lower layers in Transformer models may be more suitable for specific tasks in Transfer Learning. It also proposes further research on skip connections to explore direct information transfer between non-adjacent layers. The findings support the idea of modularity in Transformer networks, where specific layers solve different problems, hinting at potential benefits for task-specific training. Our findings suggest that specific layers in Transformer networks solve different problems, indicating modularity that can be leveraged in training. It may be beneficial to tailor parts of the network to specific tasks during pre-training instead of using an end-to-end language model. Further research should focus on understanding how state-of-the-art models tackle downstream tasks to enhance their performance."
