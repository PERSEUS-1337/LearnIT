PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, providing a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures defined benefit (DB) pension plans, providing a specified monthly benefit at retirement. PBGC runs insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans, maintaining separate reserve funds for each. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Most workers in plans taken over by PBGC receive the full pension benefit they earned. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Most workers in plans taken over by PBGC receive the full pension benefit they earned. Among participants in terminated multiemployer plans likely needing future assistance, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits exceeding it. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. Among participants in terminated multiemployer plans likely needing future assistance, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits exceeding it. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The PBGC is governed by a three-member board chaired by the Secretary of Labor, with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury as other members. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Advisory Committee advises PBGC on various issues, and recent changes under MAP-21 include setting the Director's term at five years. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) made changes to the governance structures of PBGC, including setting the Director's term at five years, requiring the Board of Directors to meet at least four times a year, and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. PBGC is self-supporting and does not receive appropriations from general revenue. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to be self-supporting and does not receive appropriations from general revenue. Congress sets premiums for private-sector employers sponsoring pension plans insured by PBGC. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is self-supporting and does not receive general revenue appropriations. Congress sets premiums for private-sector employers sponsoring pension plans insured by PBGC. PBGC's main sources of revenue include premiums, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies with underfunded pension plans. The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 requires PBGC's finances to be included in federal budget totals. The PBGC is funded by premiums paid by private-sector employers sponsoring pension plans, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded plans. Premiums include flat-rate per-participant premiums for single-employer and multiemployer plans, as well as additional premiums for underfunded single-employer plans based on the amount of underfunding. The PBGC is funded by premiums paid by private-sector employers sponsoring pension plans. Sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer plans pay flat-rate per-participant premiums, with additional premiums for underfunded single-employer plans. In 2019, single-employer DB pension plans pay an annual flat-rate premium of $80 per participant. In certain situations, terminated pension plans pay per-participant premiums for three years. The premiums for 2019 include a flat-rate premium of $80 per participant for single-employer plans, a variable-rate premium for underfunded plans, and a termination premium for plans that end in certain situations. The sponsors of underfunded single-employer DB pension plans pay a variable-rate premium of $43 for each $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits, with a per-participant limit of $541. Single-employer plans that end in certain situations pay a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years. Multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. Tables in the Appendix provide a history of PBGC premium rates. The sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years following plan termination. Multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC covers only DB plans that meet qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured by PBGC. Plans must meet these requirements to receive tax benefits available to qualified pension plans. Premium rates for DB pension plans are detailed in Table 1 for FY2017 and FY2018. PBGC only covers plans that meet Section 401 qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) are not insured by PBGC. Meeting IRC Section 401 requirements allows for tax benefits for qualified pension plans. Employer contributions are tax-deductible, and neither contributions nor plan earnings are taxable to participants. Income received from the plan is taxed. A qualified pension plan meeting IRC Section 401 requirements allows for tax benefits, with employer contributions being tax-deductible and not taxable to participants. Income received from the plan is taxed as ordinary income. The plan must be permanent, provide definite benefits, not discriminate, and cover a certain group of employees. When income is received from a qualified pension plan, it is taxed as ordinary income. The plan must be established permanently, provide definite benefits, not discriminate, and cover a minimum number of employees. Plans excluded from PBGC insurance include governmental, church, and certain professional plans with fewer than 25 participants. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures pension plans that provide benefits to a minimum number of employees, excluding certain types of plans like governmental, church, and professional plans with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC operates separate insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans, with distinct reserve funds for each program. PBGC operates separate insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to multiemployer DB pension plans. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans and manages the assets in a trust fund. Participants receive their benefits from PBGC. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan, with notification required to participants and PBGC. PBGC may also involuntarily terminate plans. PBGC provides loans to insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan, with notification required to participants and PBGC. PBGC may involuntarily terminate underfunded plans if the sponsor is unable to fund its pension obligations. If a company voluntarily ends its pension plan with sufficient assets to cover liabilities, PBGC does not pay benefits to participants, but confirms termination requirements have been met. PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor is unable to fund its pension obligations. A company may voluntarily end its pension plan if the plan's assets are sufficient to cover benefit liabilities. PBGC does not pay benefits to plan participants in such cases, but confirms termination requirements have been met. Benefit liabilities include all benefits earned by plan participants, vested and nonvested, early retirement supplements, and certain contingent benefits. The plan distributes benefits to participants by purchasing annuity contracts from an insurance company or providing for the payment of benefits. If assets are sufficient to cover benefit liabilities, the plan distributes benefits to participants by purchasing annuity contracts or providing lump-sum distributions. Excess assets may be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, which is included in the employer's gross income and subject to a nondeductible excise tax. The employer may recover excess assets through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. The tax rate is 20% if a qualified replacement plan is established, otherwise 50%. In distress terminations, the plan goes into PBGC receivership. When an underfunded plan terminates in distress or involuntarily, PBGC becomes the trustee, taking control of assets and liabilities. PBGC pays benefits from plan assets and employer recoveries, with any remaining guaranteed benefits covered by PBGC's funds. PBGC becomes trustee when a plan terminates, taking control of assets and liabilities. PBGC pays benefits from plan assets and employer recoveries, with any remaining guaranteed benefits covered by PBGC's funds. If assets are insufficient, the employer can only terminate the plan under specific distress criteria. Distress Terminations: Employers can only terminate a plan under specific distress criteria, such as bankruptcy filings or reorganization petitions within the controlled group. The distress termination criteria for plan sponsors include bankruptcy filings, reorganization petitions within the controlled group, and approval by the bankruptcy court for plan termination. PBGC may also determine termination is necessary for the employer to pay its debts. The distress termination criteria for plan sponsors include bankruptcy filings, reorganization petitions within the controlled group, and approval by the bankruptcy court for plan termination. PBGC may also determine termination is necessary for the employer to pay its debts. The criteria for distress termination were added by the Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 and modified by subsequent legislation. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if the employer cannot meet strict financial standards indicating an inability to fund the plan, as outlined in various legislative acts. The Retirement Protection Act of 1994 ensures employer responsibility for underfunded plans unless strict financial standards are met. PBGC can terminate a plan involuntarily if minimum funding standards are not met, benefits cannot be paid, and a substantial owner has received a distribution over $10,000. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received over $10,000, or if PBGC expects an unreasonable increase in long-run loss. A federal court may also order termination to protect participants' interests. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received over $10,000, or if PBGC expects an unreasonable increase in long-run loss. A federal court may also order termination to protect participants' interests. If a plan is unable to pay benefits currently due or has unfunded vested benefits, PBGC must terminate it. Federal court intervention can also occur to prevent unreasonable financial deterioration or liability increase for PBGC. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received over $10,000, or if PBGC expects an unreasonable increase in long-run loss. From FY1974 through FY2016, PBGC became the trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans, with only a small fraction resulting in claims against PBGC. Most pension plan terminations are standard terminations. Following a distress or involuntary termination, the plan's sponsor and every member of that sponsor's controlled group are liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which is the value of the plan's liabilities minus the fair market value of the plan's assets at termination. The liability is joint and several, with PBGC becoming trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans from FY1974 through FY2016. In case of distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, calculated as liabilities minus assets at termination. The liability is payable in cash or securities to PBGC, with failure to pay leading to a lien on the employer's property. In distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. Payment is due in cash or negotiable securities, with failure to pay potentially resulting in a lien on the employer's property. If the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. When a plan undergoing distress termination is sponsored by a company in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits within limits set by Congress, depending on the terminated plan's assets and recoveries from the employer. When an underfunded plan terminates, PBGC pays benefits based on guaranteed limits set by Congress, the plan's assets, and recoveries from the employer. PBGC guarantees vested retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits at the date of plan termination. PBGC guarantees vested retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits that were owed or in payment status at the date of plan termination. Only retirement benefits payable in monthly installments are guaranteed, including benefits that commence before the plan's normal retirement age. Contingent benefits are guaranteed only if the triggering event occurs before plan termination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that commence before the plan's normal age of retirement, contingent benefits are guaranteed only if the triggering event occurs before plan termination. The PBGC guarantee for certain benefits is phased in over a five-year period after the event occurs. ERISA sets a maximum on the individual benefit amount that PBGC can guarantee. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that commence before the plan's normal age of retirement. PBGC guarantee for certain benefits is phased in over a five-year period after the event occurs. The maximum pension guarantee is $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019, adjusted annually for national wage growth. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits before the normal retirement age, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. This amount is adjusted annually and can be affected by the age at which the participant starts receiving benefits. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. The benefit amount can be affected by the age at which the participant starts receiving benefits, with an increase if they start after age 65. Table 3 shows examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefit for different ages and types of annuities. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. The benefit amount can be affected by the age at which the participant starts receiving benefits, with an increase if they start after age 65. Table 3 contains examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefit for individuals who begin receiving benefits at different ages and with different types of annuities. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before the age of 65 is based on a percentage scale depending on the age at which benefits are received and the type of annuity chosen. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid in a form other than a straight-life annuity depends on the type of benefit, survivor's benefit percentage, and age difference between participant and spouse. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and benefits for survivors. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. Basic benefits include benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and benefits for survivors. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. More than 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans trusteed by PBGC received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Assets of a terminated plan are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule. In a study released in 2008, PBGC indicated that over 80% of recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Assets of terminated plans are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. Some nonguaranteed benefits are payable before certain guaranteed benefits, such as benefits for participants receiving pension payments for over three years having priority over those not yet receiving payments. PBGC is also required to pay a portion of participants' unfunded benefits. PBGC pays nonguaranteed benefits based on a priority schedule, with participants receiving pension payments for over three years having priority. PBGC also pays a portion of participants' unfunded benefits. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than plan termination. PBGC pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on a ratio of assets recovered from the employer to the amount of PBGC's claim on employer assets. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency, rather than plan termination, when available resources are insufficient to pay plan benefits. PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent plans by offering loans that are rarely repaid. If a plan's available resources are not enough to pay benefits, PBGC may step in to provide the additional resources needed. PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent multiemployer plans by offering loans that are rarely repaid. If available resources are insufficient to pay benefits, PBGC may provide the additional resources needed. Repayment of loans by plans recovering from insolvency is required, with only one plan having repaid any financial assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans, with a different guarantee ceiling than single-employer plans. Multiemployer plans determine benefits by multiplying a flat dollar amount. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans, with a different guarantee ceiling than single-employer plans. Benefits are determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service, with a benefit guarantee limit tied to this formula. The limit equals years of service multiplied by (1) 100% of the first $11 of the monthly benefit rate and (2) 75% of the next $33 of the benefit rate. The benefit guarantee ceiling for participants in multiemployer plans is determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service. For a participant with 30 years of service, the guaranteed limit is $12,870. PBGC estimated in 2015 that 79% of participants in multiemployer plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit. The benefit formula for participants in multiemployer plans is not adjusted for national wage index increases. In 2015, PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance got their full benefit, but only 49% in plans that may need assistance in the future would receive full payment. Ongoing plans have almost double the average benefit compared to terminated plans. Among ongoing plans, the average benefit is almost twice as large as in terminated plans. This suggests that a larger percentage of participants in plans that may need PBGC financial assistance in the future are likely to see benefit reductions. PBGC's net financial position, the difference between assets and liabilities, was $112.3 billion at the end of FY2018. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds, which contain pension plan assets and premiums from plan sponsors. At the end of FY2018, PBGC had assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion, resulting in a net financial position of -$51.4 billion. PBGC's assets consist of its trust fund and revolving funds, which hold pension plan assets and premiums from plan sponsors. The trust fund includes assets from pension plans PBGC oversees, while the revolving funds contain premiums, transfers from the trust fund, and returns on investments in U.S. Treasury securities. PBGC's funds consist of premiums from plan sponsors, transfers from the trust fund, and returns on investments. The main liabilities are future benefit payments and financial assistance. PBGC has had a deficit since FY2002 due to costly plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines. PBGC has provided financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program. Table 4 shows PBGC's net financial position from FY1999 to FY2018, with deficits each year since FY2002 due to costly plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines. The single-employer program had a deficit of $23.3 billion by the end of 2004 but showed a surplus in FY2018, partly due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program had a surplus from FY1982 to FY2002 but has reported deficits since then. The PBGC single-employer program had a deficit of $23.3 billion by the end of 2004 but showed a surplus in FY2018 due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program had a surplus from FY1982 to FY2002 but has reported deficits since then. PBGC projects that the multiemployer program may become insolvent in FY2025 with a less than 1% chance of remaining solvent in FY2026. Both programs are on the GAO's list of high-risk government programs. PBGC reported deficits each year since FY2002. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025 with less than a 1% chance of solvency in FY2026. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. In FY2015, approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC, with an average monthly payment of $536. The median monthly payment was $279. Among retiree payees, the average monthly benefit was $606, and among beneficiary payees, it was $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment, with an average amount of $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus in FY1996 for the first time in its history. In FY2015, 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment with an average amount of $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, attributed to factors like investment income. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus of $2.44 billion due to factors like investment income and increased premium income. Seventy-eight multiemployer plans received financial assistance in FY2018, with approximately 62,300 participants receiving assistance and 27,800 expected to receive benefits in the future. In FY2018, approximately 62,300 multiemployer plan participants received financial assistance, with 27,800 expected to receive benefits in the future. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, but decreased to $53.8 billion in FY2018. The financial condition of the multiemployer insurance program has been worsening, with the deficit increasing from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017. It decreased to $53.8 billion in FY2018. The large increase in the deficit in FY2014 was due to the likelihood of insolvency of several large multiemployer pension plans in financial distress. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and the interaction of PBGC's trust and revolving funds. The increase in the likelihood of insolvency of large multiemployer pension plans has impacted PBGC's budgetary cash flows, which are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and the interaction of trust and revolving funds. Trust funds hold pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain premiums from plan sponsors and returns on investments. When PBGC takes over a single-employer pension plan, its assets are transferred. PBGC becomes trustee of terminated pension plans, managing assets in a nonbudgetary trust fund with returns on investments. Transfers to the trust fund are not in the federal budget or balance sheet. Private-sector money managers handle trust fund assets based on PBGC's investment policy. The terminated pension plan assets are transferred to PBGC and placed in a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The trust fund's investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income, with total investments reaching $70.2 billion by FY2018. PBGC has seven authorized revolving funds, but only three are currently in use. The investment policy established by PBGC's Board of Directors allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income assets. Trust fund investments totaled $70.2 billion by the end of FY2018. PBGC has seven authorized revolving funds, but only three are currently in use to pay benefits. PBGC uses three revolving funds funded by premiums and investments to pay participants' benefits. The funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with total assets of $33.2 billion at the end of FY2018. The revolving funds used by PBGC to pay participants' benefits are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. The total assets of the funds at the end of FY2018 were $33.2 billion, with Fund 1 at $1.8 billion, Fund 2 at $2.1 billion, and Fund 7 at $29.3 billion. Increases or decreases in the funds are reflected as on-budget federal receipts and outlays, with gross outlays covering benefit payments and administrative expenses, and receipts including premiums, interest, and reimbursements. Increases in premiums paid by pension plan sponsors to PBGC contribute to federal revenue. Some stakeholders criticize recent PBGC premium increases as they feel it offsets federal spending, doesn't improve PBGC's financial condition, and may discourage employers from maintaining DB pension plans. In its FY2017 Projections Report, PBGC estimated its financial condition. PBGC projected in its FY2017 Projections Report that the single-employer program's deficit would shrink, while the multiemployer program is expected to run out of money by FY2025. The average estimate from PBGC's simulations was a $26 billion deficit. PBGC projected in its report that the single-employer program's deficit is expected to shrink, with a projected $26 billion surplus in 10 years. However, the multiemployer program is likely to run out of money by FY2025 due to the insolvency of several large pension plans. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. The multiemployer program is at risk of insolvency before FY2025, with a high probability of insolvency by 2026 due to large pension plans. The multiemployer program's potential future financial assistance exposure is $53.8 billion, and current premium levels may not be enough to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. The PBGC's FY2018 Annual Report projected a $53.8 billion exposure for future financial assistance in the multiemployer program. Premium levels may not be sufficient to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans would need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections only. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allowed for adjustments in multiemployer DB pension plans. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections only, reducing the need for financial assistance from PBGC. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to avoid needing financial assistance from PBGC, improving PBGC's financial condition. There is uncertainty in how benefit suspensions and plan partitions will be used, but it is estimated that MPRA will not change PBGC's future solvency projections. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans in response to concerns from policymakers and stakeholders. The committee was tasked with formulating recommendations by November 30, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 established a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to improve the solvency of pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The committee did not meet the deadline for releasing recommendations or legislative language. Historical data on single-employer program premium levels is provided in Table A-1. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans failed to meet the deadline for releasing recommendations or legislative language to improve pension plan solvency. Historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels is provided in Tables A-1 and A-2."
