U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad for high-level talks, including discussion of Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes. Hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship were dashed as no breakthrough was achieved. Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes, including \"signature strikes\" targeting suspected militants, remain a major point of contention in the bilateral relationship with the US. The CIA's reluctance to give up the ability to strike \"high-value targets\" and concerns over civilian deaths from such strikes further complicate the situation. Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes, including \"signature strikes\" targeting suspected militants, remain a major point of contention in the bilateral relationship with the US. The issue of civilian deaths from these strikes adds complexity to the situation. Reports suggest that Pakistani leaders may link opening NATO's ground supply lines to ending drone strikes, but no official confirmation has been made. The main sticking point may be Pakistan's demand for an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. As of now, none of these major issues have been resolved. Pakistan is refusing to open NATO's ground supply lines through Karachi until drone strikes cease. The main issue remains Pakistan's demand for an apology for the accidental deaths of soldiers at Salala. The US is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements pending resolution. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry states they will follow Parliament's recommendations. The U.S. government is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding from Pakistan until an agreement on bilateral reengagement is reached.

President-General Zia ul-Haq supported Afghan mujahideen during the 1980s, and Islamabad later supported the Afghan Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001. British colonialists divided the ethnic Pashtun tribes with the 1893 \"Durand Line.\" President-General Zia ul-Haq supported Afghan mujahideen in the 1980s and later backed the Afghan Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001. The 1893 \"Durand Line\" divided Pashtun tribes, causing tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, making their strained relationship detrimental to American interests. The 1,600-mile porous border known as the \"Durand Line\" divides Pashtun tribes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, leading to tension.

Americans want to \"fight, talk, build,\" while Pakistanis prefer a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for the Americans to leave\" strategy. Pakistani officials are confused by unclear U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Some argue that Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by giving their security services a key role in brokering peace with insurgent forces they have fostered, including the Taliban. The ISI has been accused of trying to reinstate the Taliban regime overthrown in 2001. Pakistani cooperation is still deemed essential by U.S. officials and independent observers. Pakistani intransigence is seen as a potential risk in brokering peace with insurgent forces, including the Taliban, as the ISI has been accused of trying to reinstate the Taliban regime. Despite this, Pakistani cooperation is still considered essential for long-term stability in Afghanistan. Afghan insurgents are known to find safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi, as well as in western Pakistan's tribal agencies. U.S. military commanders view these havens as central to the conflict. Despite some warming of Pakistan-Afghanistan ties in 2010 and early 2011, Afghan officials openly accuse Pakistani cooperation as necessary for reconciliation and long-term stability in Afghanistan.

Pakistani leaders traveled to Kabul in 2011 to accelerate the peace process, with American observers noting efforts to wean Kabul away from its strategic partnership with the United States. In April 2011, Prime Minister Gilani, Army Chief Kayani, and ISI Director Pasha traveled to Kabul to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission and accelerate the peace process. Gilani criticized America's \"imperial designs\" and advocated for Kabul and Islamabad to take ownership of the peace process. Reports suggested Gilani aimed to move Kabul closer to Islamabad and seek support from China. In June 2011, Prime Minister Gilani and President Karzai expressed commitment to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" peace process, leading to a 23-point \"Islamabad Declaration\" for improved ties. However, increased \"reverse infiltration\" in the summer of 2011 caused friction between Islamabad and Kabul.

In September 2011, Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani was assassinated in Kabul by a suicide bomber, damaging hopes for reconciliation talks. Afghan officials suspected ISI involvement, as the attacker was Pakistani and the plot was planned in Quetta. Pakistan denied any role in the assassination, but Afghan President accused them of supporting terrorism. Afghan intelligence also claimed to have foiled a plot to assassinate Karzai in October. In October, Afghan intelligence officials claimed to have stopped a plot to assassinate Karzai, with alleged culprits based in FATA and linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis. Islamabad supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, emphasizing Kabul's role in setting parameters for the process. Pakistan denies involvement in the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Rabbani, despite suspicions of ISI's role. Afghan President continues to accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Pakistan strongly supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban and believes Kabul should set parameters for the process. Islamabad aims to control which Taliban figures can negotiate, motivated by a desire to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan. Pakistan considers itself crucial for successful Afghan peace talks, aiming to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan by controlling which Taliban figures can negotiate. The capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in 2010 was seen as a move to facilitate talks with select Taliban commanders, although some believe it was orchestrated to hinder negotiations. In 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a key aide to Mullah Omar, was captured in Karachi in a joint ISI-CIA operation. Some believe the arrest was orchestrated by Pakistani elements to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders for reconciliation negotiations. Pakistan's efforts to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqani Network raised concerns about Islamabad exploiting the political situation to gain maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. In mid-2010, Pakistan attempted to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqani Network, raising concerns about Islamabad's intentions to gain maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and Afghan officials in Kabul, with unclear involvement of Pakistani officials. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan suggested that Pakistan has substantial influence over top Afghan insurgents, hindering Taliban leaders from traveling to Kabul for reconciliation talks. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan indicated that Pakistan has significant influence over top Afghan insurgents, preventing Taliban leaders from attending reconciliation talks in Kabul. Afghan President Karzai also expressed concerns about insurgent leaders in Pakistan being too controlled by Islamabad to negotiate independently. By early 2012, Pakistan seemed to be allowing the U.S.-Taliban negotiation process to move forward. In early 2012, Afghan President Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations, despite Foreign Minister Khar calling it unrealistic. Prime Minister Gilani later made an open appeal to the Afghan Taliban leadership. In April, Afghan President Karzai requested Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations, which Foreign Minister Khar deemed unrealistic. However, Prime Minister Gilani later made an open appeal to the Afghan Taliban leadership for national reconciliation and peace, which was welcomed by the Obama Administration. There are concerns about Pakistan's security services maintaining ties with certain Afghan insurgent groups. The Obama Administration welcomed Prime Minister Gilani's open appeal to the Afghan Taliban leadership for national reconciliation and peace. Concerns persist about Pakistan's security services maintaining ties with Afghan insurgent groups. The Haqqani network in the FATA is seen as the most dangerous insurgent group in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is considered the most dangerous insurgent group in Afghanistan, posing a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests in the region. They are Afghanistan's most capable and potent insurgent group, operating in the FATA region. The Haqqani Network is the most dangerous insurgent group in Afghanistan, posing a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. They maintain close ties with al-Qaeda and are not reconcilable, requiring sustained military offensives by ISAF and Afghan forces. Islamabad officials have consistently deferred on urgent U.S. requests regarding the Pakistani military. The Haqqani Network maintains close ties with al-Qaeda and is considered the most dangerous insurgent group in Afghanistan. Analysts argue that military offensives by ISAF and Afghan forces are necessary to deal with the group. Islamabad officials have been reluctant to launch operations against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan, citing stretched military forces and a long-standing relationship with Jalaluddin Haqqani. The U.S. requests Pakistani military to launch operations against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan due to their high-profile attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan's inaction is attributed to their longstanding relationship with Jalaluddin Haqqani and the belief that his group can help exert Pashtun-based influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and the U.S. Embassy compound. These attacks have strained U.S.-Pakistan relations and raised concerns about Islamabad's support for the Haqqani network. In September 2011, a well-planned attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul left 16 Afghans dead, including 5 police officers and 6 children. This assault strained U.S.-Pakistan relations and raised doubts about Afghanistan's security. The 20-hour-long assault in Kabul resulted in the deaths of 16 Afghans, including 5 police officers and 6 children. The attack was seen as a blow to the narrative of Afghanistan's security improving. Following the attack, Admiral Mullen urged General Kayani to take action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions with Pakistan. Mullen accused the ISI of supporting the Haqqanis in a \"proxy war.\" Days after the Kabul attack, Admiral Mullen urged General Kayani to act against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions with Pakistan. Mullen accused the ISI of supporting the Haqqanis in a \"proxy war.\" Secretary Panetta issued a warning to Pakistan, stating the US would protect its forces in Afghanistan from future Haqqani attacks. The Haqqani network, supported by Pakistan's ISI, conducted attacks in Afghanistan, prompting the US to issue warnings and threats to protect its forces. Mullen stated that the Haqqani network, with ISI support, was responsible for various attacks, including the truck bomb attack on September 13 and the assault on the US embassy. Panetta emphasized the need to put pressure on Pakistan. The Haqqani network, with ISI support, was responsible for the truck bomb attack on September 13, the assault on the US embassy, and other operations. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan. President Obama did not fully align with Admiral Mullen's accusations. The Obama Administration is increasing pressure on Pakistan to address the issue of the Haqqani network with ISI support. President Obama acknowledged unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but emphasized the need for Pakistan to resolve the problem. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's stance towards Pakistan. President Obama acknowledged unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but emphasized the need for Pakistan to address the issue. The Wardak truck bombing hardened Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis, leading to further attacks by Haqqani fighters on coalition targets in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies responsibility for the violence in Afghanistan or supporting the Haqqanis. Secretary Clinton's stance on the Haqqanis has hardened after the Wardak truck bombing. Pakistan denies supporting the Haqqanis or being responsible for attacks in Afghanistan. The Pakistani military refuted claims made by Mullen and warned the US of potentially losing an ally. President Zardari criticized the \"verbal assaults\" against Pakistan. The Pakistani military denies supporting the Haqqanis or conducting a proxy war. Foreign Minister Khar warns the US of potentially losing an ally. President Zardari criticizes verbal assaults damaging bilateral relationship. Pakistani officials have tried to facilitate peace with the Haqqanis, but Al Qaeda links remain a major obstacle. Unnamed Pakistani military officials claim they can \"deliver\" the Haqqanis to negotiations, as Pakistan is seen to have influence over them due to close ties. This is considered the only viable policy option for peace efforts. Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies are believed to have influence over the Haqqani network and may be able to push them towards negotiations. This is seen as the only viable option for peace efforts, as a military assault on Haqqani bases could lead to a wider conflict. Islamabad's involvement in negotiations would secure a central role in the process. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law, amidst pressure from senior Senators. Islamabad's involvement in negotiations with the insurgent group is seen as the only viable option for peace efforts, as a military assault could lead to a wider conflict. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators. The decision is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators like Co-Chair Senator Dianne Feinstein. Seven Haqqani leaders have been under U.S. sanctions since 2008, and Secretary Clinton designated operational commander Badruddin Haqqani in 2011. The potential decision on an FTO designation is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not emerged from the House. The Haqqani Network may be designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Obama Administration, with pressure from Senator Dianne Feinstein. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 passed the Senate but has not progressed in the House. The Administration's delay in making a formal review on the FTO designation has caused frustration in Congress. Ammonium nitrate is a common fertilizer used in making improvised explosive devices. The Obama Administration has faced frustration from Congress for delaying the formal review on designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Ammonium nitrate, a common fertilizer, is used in making improvised explosive devices by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan. Illicit AN in Afghanistan is believed to come from transshipments from Pakistan. The use of ammonium nitrate (AN) in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan has increased, with most illicit AN believed to come from transshipments from Pakistan. Despite historic peaks in total IED events in 2011, improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. The Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2012 required the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense to address this issue. In the summer of 2011, there were historic peaks in total IED events in Afghanistan, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to AN or encourage Pakistani law. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to AN or encourage Pakistani law enforcement and border security agencies to be more active in preventing its movement into Afghanistan. Washington's efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives. The U.S. government is urging Pakistan to adjust laws to restrict access to AN or enhance border security to prevent its movement into Afghanistan. Washington's efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives, with agencies like JIEDDO, SRAP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement involved. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation targeting the trafficking of chemical explosives. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in late 2010 to combat the illicit cross-border diversion and trafficking of 11 chemical explosives precursors. The program involves the State Department's SRAP staff, Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, and collaboration with international organizations. Notable successes have been achieved, and adding urea fertilizer granules to ammonium nitrate can complicate the processing for explosives. Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement operation, aims to combat the illicit trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. Collaborative efforts with international organizations have led to notable successes. Experts recommend adding urea fertilizer granules to ammonium nitrate to complicate the processing for explosives. Other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags to track shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex. The Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad is being considered to further restrict ammonium nitrate and other precursors for explosives. The Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, has been producing over 300,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad is being considered to further restrict AN and other precursors for explosives, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The United States has had to rely on Pakistani police in the absence of an outright ban. The Islamabad government has established a National Counter-IED Forum for Pakistani agencies to collaborate on an action plan. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities for counter-terrorism efforts due to the lack of an outright ban on explosives precursors. NATO's supply routes through Pakistan to Afghanistan have been closed for six months. NATO has been reliant on Pakistani authorities for supply routes to Afghanistan, which have been closed for six months due to tensions between Pakistan and the United States. Insurgents have targeted these supply lines, leading to temporary closures in the past. \"Supply routes to Afghanistan from Pakistan have been closed for six months due to tensions between the two countries. Insurgents have targeted these routes, especially near the Khyber Pass and Quetta, resulting in destroyed trucks and casualties among Pakistani drivers.\" The closure of supply routes to Afghanistan from Pakistan has led to destruction of trucks and casualties among Pakistani drivers. Truck drivers often have to pay bribes to officials to reach the Afghan border from Karachi. In response, the U.S. military is testing alternative routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan. Truck drivers pay bribes to officials to reach Afghan border from Karachi. Trucks destroyed en route, fuel and cargo sold in Peshawar markets. US military testing alternative routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan. Northern Distribution Network carries over half of NATO's supplies, but only nonlethal cargo. US defense officials prefer Pakistan for faster logistics route. The U.S. military is testing alternative routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan for logistics. The \"Northern Distribution Network\" now carries over half of NATO's supplies, but only nonlethal cargo. Despite the preference for Pakistan due to speed and cost, the U.S. is expanding aerial and NDN routes, even though they are more costly and involve reliance on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. The loss of Pakistani routes has not had as much of a negative impact on Afghan operations as anticipated. The loss of Pakistani GLOCs has not had a significant negative impact on Afghan operations, with the U.S. military managing well without them. Reopening the GLOCs would be beneficial and provide financial benefits to Pakistan. Gen. Allen stated that the closure has not negatively affected the campaign. The Pentagon's April report highlighted the strategic concern of the continued closure of Pakistani GLOCs, which has hindered Afghan security forces by causing a backlog of equipment. Over 4,100 vehicles are stranded in Pakistan due to the closure, but airlift capabilities have helped mitigate the impact on communication equipment movement. The April report on Afghanistan and Pakistan highlighted the strategic concern of the continued closure of Pakistani GLOCs, which has hindered Afghan security forces by causing a backlog of equipment. Over 4,100 vehicles are stranded in Pakistan due to the closure, but airlift capabilities have helped mitigate the impact on communication equipment movement. NATO will need to remove at least 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion as they withdraw from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders became more insistent on reopening Pakistani GLOCs as the spring \"fighting season\" approached in early 2012. In withdrawing from Afghanistan, NATO needs to remove 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion. U.S. commanders pushed for reopening Pakistani GLOCs as the spring \"fighting season\" approached in early 2012. Pakistani officials indicated that reopening was imminent. Pakistani GLOCs were set to reopen after political and military leaders agreed in mid-March. By mid-May, officials indicated that reopening was imminent, with reports of a proposed fee increase to $5,000 per truck just before the Chicago summit. \"Pakistan proposed a fee increase to $5,000 per truck just before the Chicago summit, a significant jump from previous levels. This hike was difficult for the Pentagon to accept, as Pakistani GLOCs were previously considered 'free' in exchange for CSF reimbursements.\" The Pentagon is struggling to accept Pakistan's proposed fee increase to $5,000 per truck for GLOCs, which were previously considered free in exchange for CSF reimbursements. Negotiations on this issue have not yet been resolved. Islamist extremism and militancy have been a significant problem in Pakistani society since 2007, with attacks peaking in 2009. The Services Committee deemed the $5,000 fee unacceptable, with one member calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue remain unresolved. Islamist extremism has plagued Pakistani society since 2007, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Additionally, Pakistan faces a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. NCTC has reported significant declines in terrorism. The number of victims peaked in Pakistan in 2009 due to widespread Islamist violence, separatist insurgency in Baluchistan, and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. NCTC reports a decline in terrorist incidents and deaths since 2009, ranking Pakistan third in the world after Afghanistan and Iraq. Suicide bombings increased from 2 in 2002 to 84 in 2009, but decreased to 51 in 2010 and 41 in 2011. The NCTC reports a significant decline in terrorist incidents and related deaths in Pakistan since 2009, ranking the country third globally after Afghanistan and Iraq. Suicide bombings increased from 2 in 2002 to 84 in 2009, but dropped to 51 in 2010 and 41 in 2011. Pakistan accounted for nearly half of all suicide bombing deaths worldwide during those years, with militants targeting the country's military and intelligence institutions. In recent years, Pakistan has seen a decline in Islamist attacks, attributed to military operations, drone strikes, and improved law enforcement. However, some observers believe the government is sometimes influenced by terrorists. Pakistan has various Islamist militant groups operating within its borders. The decline in Islamist attacks in Pakistan is attributed to military operations, drone strikes, and improved law enforcement. However, some believe the government is influenced by terrorists. Various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have become more intermingled and mutually supportive since 2009. Al Qaeda terrorists still operate in Pakistan, but have been weakened in recent years. Islamist militant groups in Pakistan, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Quetta Shura Taliban, have become more interconnected and supportive since 2009. Al Qaeda presence in Pakistan remains a concern for U.S. leaders, despite recent losses in key leaders and operatives. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged in late 2007, representing Pakistan's tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are based in different regions of Pakistan. Punjab province houses various Islamist militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The Haqqani Network of Afghan insurgents is based in North Waziristan and Kurram agencies of FATA. Punjab province in Pakistan is home to Islamist militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The LeT has ties to the ISI and is considered the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia. The Raymond Davis affair may have revealed new U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT in Pakistan. The LeT, a U.S.-designated terrorist group with ties to the ISI, is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The Raymond Davis affair may have exposed new U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT in Pakistan. Analysts consider the LeT the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, with potential to become a global threat. LeT's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), has an expanding infrastructure in Pakistan. Husain Haqqani criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. violations. LeT, a U.S.-designated terrorist group with ties to the ISI, is considered the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, with potential to become a global threat. Husain Haqqani criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. violations instead of combating the \"jihadist ideology\" that has cost many Pakistani lives. Husain Haqqani criticizes Pakistan's apparent fixation on U.S. violations of sovereignty instead of addressing the \"jihadist ideology\" that has caused numerous Pakistani casualties. He believes this mindset was fostered by military dictators to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed over 150,000 troops in western Pakistan. In Haqqani's view, military dictators encouraged a misguided national mindset to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all seven FATA agencies and adjacent regions, with notable offensives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. The Pakistan army has deployed regular and paramilitary troops in western Pakistan in response to the surge in militancy, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all seven FATA agencies and adjacent regions, with notable offensives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. U.S. government assessments paint a discouraging picture of recent efforts, with challenges in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases of military operations. The Pakistani military offensives in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011 have had mixed results, with successes in clearing but difficulties in holding and building. Independent analyses also highlight the limited progress in sustained counterinsurgency efforts, with no notable militant leaders captured or killed. The Pakistani military offensives in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011 had mixed results, with temporary success in dislodging militants but limited sustained progress in counterinsurgency efforts. The air force conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in FATA, with ongoing sporadic offensives in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The Pakistani air force has flown over 5,500 combat sorties in the FATA, dropping more than 10,000 bombs. Ground operations have resulted in the capture or killing of leaders. Bloody fighting continues in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The army is making progress in degrading LI's capabilities, but insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. In Spring 2012, battles in Khyber led to the displacement of 500,000 civilians. The Pakistani army has made progress in degrading LI's capabilities, but a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. TTP militants overran a fort in South Waziristan, killing 15 soldiers. Bajaur also experienced a deadly TTP suicide bombing in May 2012. In January, TTP militants overran a Frontier Constabulary fort in South Waziristan and executed 15 soldiers. Bajaur suffered its worst militant attack in more than a year when a TTP suicide bomber killed dozens of people in May 2012, including the local Bajaur Levies commander and his deputy. North Waziristan agency is currently the most important haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants. The North Waziristan agency is a key haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, but Pakistani officials have not moved their military into the area despite U.S. requests. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks capacity for effective nonconventional warfare. Pakistan's military has not moved into North Waziristan despite U.S. requests, citing the need to consolidate control. They lack experience in counterinsurgency and face challenges in acquiring necessary hardware. The expulsion of U.S. military trainers in 2011 has hindered efforts to enhance Pakistan's capabilities. Pakistan's military has faced challenges in acquiring necessary hardware for nonconventional warfare. The ejection of U.S. military trainers in July 2011 has hindered U.S. efforts to bolster Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities. Independent analysts suggest that Pakistan's military operations and political approach have splintered the Pakistani Taliban, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in 2011. The Pakistani Taliban was effectively splintered in 2011 through military operations and political strategies, resulting in smaller factions that do not follow the orders of the TTP leader. This fragmentation led to a significant decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan. Hakimullah Mehsud, the nominal TTP leader, has conflicts with other militant commanders and was reportedly targeted for assassination by his former deputy. Hakimullah Mehsud, the TTP leader, has feuds with other militant commanders and was targeted for assassination by his former deputy due to his close ties with Al Qaeda Arabs. Pakistani officials considered new negotiations with TTP militants in 2011 as the US favored talks with the Afghan Taliban. In late 2011, Pakistani officials considered new negotiations with TTP militants, as the US began favoring talks with the Afghan Taliban. Deputy TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed meetings with government representatives started in November, but Rawalpindi did not confirm the initiative. Previous failed negotiation attempts in FATA raised concerns domestically and internationally. Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed meetings with government representatives began in November, but Rawalpindi remained silent. Concerns arose due to past failed negotiation attempts in FATA. Despite denials by a TTP spokesman, Faqir was reportedly removed from his TTP position for engaging in dialogue with the government, angering his lieutenants. Negotiations seem to have taken place and may be ongoing, with pressure from Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar on Pakistani militants. Negotiations between Pakistani militants and the government may be ongoing, despite denials by a TTP spokesman. Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar is pressuring militants to make peace with the Pakistani army. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators are said to have facilitated a pact to unify four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. Mullah Omar has pressured Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army to strengthen his own ranks. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators facilitated a pact to unify four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. The \"Shura-i-Muraqba\" comprised of Haqqanis and commanders Wali-ur-Rehman, Maulvi Nazir, and Gul Bahadar, will focus hostility solely on Afghanistan, unlike the TTP which is at war with Pakistan. The Haqqanis aim to shift FATA militants' focus to Afghanistan by ending the anti-Pakistan insurgency. The Haqqanis, along with commanders Wali-ur-Rehman, Maulvi Nazir, and Gul Bahadar, are directing their hostility towards Afghanistan to further their own cause and shift FATA militants' focus away from anti-Pakistan insurgency. The U.S. and other world governments remain concerned about Pakistan's role in terrorist activities, with a $10 million reward offered for information leading to the conviction of Hafiz Saeed, leader of a terrorist group. In April 2012, the U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the conviction of Pakistani citizen Hafiz Saeed, leader of a terrorist group involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack. This move was criticized by Prime Minister Gilani as a negative message that would worsen U.S.-Pakistan relations. In April 2012, the U.S. offered a $10 million reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, leader of the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack. This caused tension in U.S.-Pakistan relations, with Prime Minister Gilani criticizing it as a negative move. Opposition lawmakers also condemned the announcement. Additionally, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President Musharraf. In April 2012, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President Musharraf. The raid bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels and raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Pakistani state's security apparatus. The government inquiry concluded that various authorities were collectively responsible for the security lapse during the raid that bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the Islamabad government for not doing enough. U.S. officials are concerned about the impunity of Pakistan-based extremists. During a visit to New Delhi in May 2012, Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to clear its territory of terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the Islamabad government for not taking sufficient action against Hafiz Saeed. U.S. officials are concerned about the impunity of Pakistan-based extremist groups like the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, LeT, and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Pakistan-based extremist and militant groups, including the Afghan Taliban leadership in Quetta and Karachi, the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, and U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations like LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan's Punjabi heartland, pose significant threats to the United States and its allies. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by these groups escalated in 2010, exemplified by Faisal Shahzad's failed bombing attempt as a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted to detonate a car bomb in New York City's Times Square. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, and Shahzad confessed to receiving bomb-making training in western Pakistan. He was sentenced to life in prison. Other cases linked U.S. citizens to Islamist terrorism. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted to detonate a car bomb in New York City's Times Square. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, and Shahzad confessed to receiving bomb-making training in western Pakistan. He was sentenced to life in prison. Other cases linked U.S. citizens to Islamist terrorism, including a Pakistani-born American involved in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack and David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, charged with traveling to Mumbai multiple times from 2006 to 2008. At least one Pakistani-born American was complicit in the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai, India. Federal prosecutors charged David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, with scouting for the attack by the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. Headley pleaded guilty to the charges, marking the first direct link between a former Pakistani military officer and terrorism suspects in the United States. Another Pakistan-born Chicagoan, Tahawwur Rana, is also connected to the case. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, scouted for the 2008 Mumbai attack by the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. He pleaded guilty to the charges, becoming the first former Pakistani military officer directly linked to terrorism suspects in the United States. Headley had connections to a retired Pakistani major suspected of being an LeT contact and interacted with Ilayas Kashmiri, a deceased former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. The Indian government sought direct access to Headley for their own investigations, which was granted. In 2010, Indian officials gained access to David Coleman Headley for interrogation, revealing a Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, a Chicago court heard testimony in the trial of Tahawwur Rana, who was charged with supporting terrorism related to the attack. Three senior LeT members were also indicted. Access was granted in 2010 for an extensive interrogation of David Coleman Headley, revealing official Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, a Chicago court heard testimony in the trial of Tahawwur Rana, who was charged with supporting terrorism related to the attack. LeT chief Hafez Saeed and a purported ISI officer named \"Major Iqbal\" were also indicted, adding to suspicions of Pakistani support for Islamist militancy. Three senior LeT members, including LeT chief Hafez Saeed and a purported ISI officer named \"Major Iqbal,\" were indicted in the case. Headley, the prosecution's star witness, revealed links between the ISI and terrorism, further straining U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of charges related to the Mumbai attack but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India has led to three full-scale wars and constant military preparedness along their mutual border for over six decades. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, stemming from the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmir issue, has led to three full-scale wars and constant military preparedness along their mutual border for over six decades. Both countries have built large defense establishments at significant cost to economic and social development. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, originating from the partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmir issue, has led to three wars and ongoing military preparedness. Both countries have large defense establishments, impacting economic and social development. A \"Composite Dialogue\" initiated in 2004 has seen modest successes like a cease-fire and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. The dialogue aims for a peaceful resolution of all bilateral issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. In 2004, a \"Composite Dialogue\" between Pakistan and India saw some successes, including a cease-fire and increased trade across the Kashmiri Line of Control. However, relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leading to a halt in the peace process. The dispute over Kashmir remains a key issue. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations worsened after a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leading to a halt in the peace process. Disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources emerged as another issue in 2010. Pakistani leaders stress the importance of resolving the Kashmir dispute for regional peace. Militarized territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources emerged as an exacerbating factor in the bilateral relationship. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of resolving the Kashmir dispute for regional peace. The U.S. government under the Obama Administration maintains a policy of keeping distance from the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan and India are also engaged in a \"shadow war\" inside Afghanistan with spies and proxies. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using Indian. The U.S. government, under the Obama Administration, continues to keep its distance from the dispute between Pakistan and India, refraining from any mediation role. There are allegations of a \"shadow war\" between the two countries inside Afghanistan, with high-visibility attacks targeting Indian interests. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference in Pakistan's western regions through Indian consulates in Afghanistan, but there is little evidence to support these claims. After the 2008 Mumbai attack, the Indian government focused on holding Islamabad accountable for harboring anti-India terrorist groups. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India held Islamabad responsible for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Despite accusations of interference through Indian consulates in Afghanistan, there is limited evidence to support these claims. In early 2011, India agreed to resume peace talks with Pakistan without explicitly addressing the terrorism issue. India agreed to resume peace talks with Pakistan in early 2011 without overtly mentioning the terrorism issue. This decision came after a brief \"cricket diplomacy\" in March 2011, where high-level peace talks were announced to be resumed after a hiatus of more than two years. Additionally, an agreement was reached between home secretaries to establish a \"terror hotline\" between the two countries. Days later, high-level peace talks between India and Pakistan resumed after a hiatus of more than two years. Following the \"cricket diplomacy\" in March 2011, bilateral talks between home secretaries led to an agreement to establish a \"terror hotline.\" Subsequent meetings in April and June focused on economic cooperation and expanding confidence-building measures related to nuclear issues. The dialogue process between India and Pakistan resumed with high-level peace talks, including discussions on economic cooperation, confidence-building measures related to nuclear and conventional weapons, and increasing trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. Trade ministers from both countries also met in New Delhi in September.

The death of OBL impacted relations between the two countries, with Indian PM Singh calling it a significant step forward in combating terrorism. The death of OBL impacted relations between Pakistan and India, with Indian PM Singh calling it a significant step forward in combating terrorism. New Delhi is concerned about a possible U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and sees the opportunity to press Pakistan to extradite perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. New Delhi is worried about a potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and views the discovery of OBL in Pakistan as a chance to push for the extradition of Mumbai attack perpetrators and other anti-India terrorists. Afghanistan's new strategic framework agreement with India in 2011 heightened Pakistan's concerns about encirclement. Lashkar-e-Taiba figures and other anti-India terrorists believed to be in Pakistan. Afghan President Karzai's trip to New Delhi in 2011 and agreement with India heightened Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Kabul's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban may have influenced closer ties with India. Fears of strategic encirclement heightened as Afghanistan accepted Indian assistance in training its security forces. Kabul's attempts to reconcile with the Taliban may have led to closer ties with India, seen as provocative by some analysts. This development could strain Pakistan's reliance on militant proxies in Afghanistan. Relations between Pakistan and India have improved in recent years. The current tenor of Pakistan's relations with India is better than it has been in many years, with the Pakistan-supported separatist rebellion in Indian-held Kashmir at its lowest ebb since 1989. In late 2011, Pakistan's government vowed to grant normal, Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trade status to India by the end of 2012, a move seen as a significant development by the U.S. State Department. The separatist rebellion in Indian-held Kashmir is at its lowest since 1989. Pakistan vowed to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India by the end of 2012, a move praised by the U.S. State Department for its potential to boost bilateral trade and build peace constituencies. Lower tariffs and fewer visa restrictions could significantly increase bilateral trade between India and Pakistan, potentially reaching tenfold the $2.5 billion seen in 2010. Islamabad's shift towards freer trade, moving from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" for imports from India, indicates a willingness to progress without insisting on resolving the Kashmir issue first. Additionally, the absence of terrorist attacks in India linked to Pakistan for over three years is a positive development. The shift from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" for imports from India by Pakistan suggests a willingness to progress without insisting on resolving the Kashmir issue first. There have been no terrorist attacks in India traced to Pakistan in over three years, marking a significant gap from previous attacks. President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 was the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005, followed shortly by an avalanche that killed 139 Pakistani soldiers at the Siachen Glacier. In April 2012, President Zardari visited India, the first such trip by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the ongoing conflict over Kashmir. The avalanche in the Himalayas killed 139 Pakistani soldiers in the region of Kashmir, bringing attention to the senseless conflict over the area. Despite signing pacts for a gas pipeline project with Turkmenistan in 2012, both Pakistan and India remain adamant about their military presence in the region. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US as part of the New Silk Road Initiative. Despite skepticism about security in Afghanistan, both governments deny plans to redeploy forces. The New Silk Road Initiative, supported by the US, aims to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan with an estimated cost of $7.6 billion. However, concerns about security in Afghanistan raise doubts about investor confidence. India's willingness to make concessions is limited due to ongoing Islamist militancy from Pakistan. Despite some analysts being cautiously optimistic about Afghanistan's future, investor confidence may not improve soon due to ongoing Islamist militancy from Pakistan. India's reluctance to make concessions is influenced by Pakistan's failure to bring Mumbai terrorism masterminds to justice, particularly the freedom of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan. Islamabad faces criticism from New Delhi for not acting on alleged evidence to prosecute Saeed and other suspects from the Mumbai attacks. India remains dissatisfied with Pakistan's inaction. India is unsatisfied with Pakistan's failure to bring Mumbai terrorism masterminds to justice, especially the freedom of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. Islamabad faces criticism for not acting on alleged evidence to prosecute Saeed and other suspects. India also seeks extradition of Ibrahim and Indian Mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan. Movement on the economic front could prevent open conflict, with Pakistan's generals playing a crucial role in future relations. Pakistan and China have a long-standing close relationship, with China being a primary arms supplier for Pakistan since the 1960s. The future course of relations between India and Pakistan hinges on the calculations made by Pakistan's generals. India is seeking extradition of Mumbai attack culprits and Indian Mujahedeen leaders believed to be in Pakistan. The economic ties between the two countries could help prevent open conflict. China has had a close and beneficial relationship with Pakistan for decades, serving as a primary arms supplier since the 1960s. Chinese companies are heavily involved in the Pakistani economy, and China plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. Chinese companies have been involved in the Pakistani economy since the 1960s, helping build arms factories and supplying weapons systems. Beijing plans to construct two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. During Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in 2010, 12 Memoranda of Understanding were signed, designating 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Contracts worth $15 billion were also signed for cooperation in various sectors.

In response to Beijing blaming Pakistani-trained militants for terrorist activities in Xinjiang province, ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing. In August 2011, Pakistan quickly responded to Beijing's accusations of Pakistani-trained militants being involved in terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province. ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing to address the concerns. By 2012, China openly expressed worries about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, leading to strains in bilateral relations. ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing in 2012 to address China's concerns about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan. This strained bilateral relations as Pakistan increasingly relied on its friendship with China amidst deteriorating ties with the US. Pakistani leaders showed closeness with China, especially after Prime Minister Gilani's visit in May 2011. Pakistani leaders showed increased closeness with China in 2011, following Prime Minister Gilani's visit. China agreed to expedite delivery of fighter jets and is in negotiations for the purchase of submarines worth up to $3 billion. This shift in alliances comes as U.S.-Pakistan ties deteriorate and Islamabad relies more on Beijing. The Chinese government emphasized the importance of respecting Pakistan's sovereignty and agreed to expedite the delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets with upgraded avionics. Pakistan is also in talks with China for the purchase of six submarines worth up to $3 billion, marking the largest-ever bilateral defense deal. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India and strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. The United States and China have a shared interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. China views its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India but also recognizes the potential for Pakistan-based terrorist groups to harm Chinese economic interests in the region. This could lead to greater U.S.-China coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services. The United States and China have a shared interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities to prevent Pakistan-based terrorist groups from harming Chinese economic interests in the region. This could lead to greater U.S.-China coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and potentially pressure Islamabad to dismantle global jihadist groups. Additionally, cooperation between the two countries could extend to nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. The United States and China have a shared interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities and potentially pressuring Islamabad to dismantle global jihadist groups like LeT. Chinese military and diplomatic support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, leading to a growing geostrategic reliance on Pakistan by China. China's own aspirations suggest that its Pakistan policies should not solely focus on balancing India, but rather encompass a wider set of interests. China's geostrategic reliance on Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions. Beijing's interests suggest a broader approach to its Pakistan policies, moving away from blanket support for Islamabad. China is unlikely to get involved in any U.S.-Pakistani rift or replace Washington as Pakistan's primary foreign benefactor. China's evolving approach to Pakistan indicates a shift from blanket support, with a focus on a wider set of interests. The Chinese government is unlikely to mediate in U.S.-Pakistani tensions or replace Washington as Pakistan's main foreign supporter. Relations between Pakistan and Iran have been strained by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups, despite some cooperation between the two countries. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and anti-Shia terrorist groups. Despite this, both countries aim to complete a natural gas pipeline from Iran to help meet Pakistan's energy needs. Iran has offered $500 million for construction after a Chinese consortium withdrew its involvement. Iran has completed construction on its side of the border for a natural gas pipeline to Pakistan. Tehran has offered $500 million to finance construction on the Pakistani side after a Chinese consortium pulled out. The U.S. opposes the project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. The Chinese consortium withdrew from the project, and the U.S. government opposes the pipeline due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Clinton stated that starting construction on the Pakistani side would violate Iran sanctions law. Tehran is trying to bypass sanctions by bartering oil for wheat and rice with Pakistan. Islamabad is determined to complete the project despite U.S. concerns. The U.S. government opposes the Iran-Pakistan pipeline project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Islamabad is determined to complete the project despite U.S. concerns. Tehran is seeking barter deals with Pakistan to bypass sanctions. U.S. is worried about the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and its history of illicit proliferation. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top U.S. concern due to past illicit proliferation activities. The network overseen by A.Q. Khan was disrupted in 2004, but concerns remain about its potential reactivation. Khan and his alleged co-conspirators have not faced criminal charges, raising worries about the network's continued existence. The network led by Pakistani metallurgist A.Q. Khan was exposed in 2004, but no charges have been brought against him or his alleged co-conspirators. Concerns persist about the network's possible reactivation and Pakistan's nuclear security. Recent reports suggest Pakistan is expanding its nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. engagement with India on civil nuclear cooperation. Pakistan's nuclear security has improved, but there are concerns about leakage of know-how or technologies. Recent reports show a rapid growth in Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India. This growth is happening as China plans to build new nuclear reactors in Pakistan, raising nonproliferation concerns for the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration wants India to join nonproliferation regimes, while Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is rapidly growing. China's plan to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan raises concerns. The deal poses a dilemma for the Obama Administration, which seeks Beijing's approval. Pakistan faces economic anxiety due to inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages, worsened by devastating flooding in the summer. The Obama Administration is requesting Beijing to justify and approve China's plan to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan. Economic anxiety in Pakistan is fueled by inflation, unemployment, food and energy shortages, worsened by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011. Corruption hinders economic development and investment rates in Pakistan. The devastating flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and 2011, along with corruption, has hindered economic development and investment rates. Foreign direct investment dropped significantly, attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad.

Pakistan's economic priorities include addressing inflation, containing the budget deficit, reviving growth, and meeting challenges posed by higher global oil prices. Despite having similar economic development levels to India for many years, India's growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, leading to higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis prompted Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar assistance. In the early 2000s, India's GDP per capita surpassed Pakistan's, leading to higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis prompted Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF, resulting in a $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement program. The 2008 balance-of-payments crisis led Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. The current $11.3 billion IMF-supported program, approved in 2008 and extended in 2010, has $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed due to reforms not being implemented. A prospective second IMF program may have stricter conditions, including public sector enterprise restructuring. IMF negotiations were postponed in 2011 due to security concerns. The IMF program in Pakistan was put on hold in August 2010 due to the government's failure to implement necessary reforms. Security concerns in May 2011 further delayed negotiations with the IMF. Pakistan sought U.S. assistance to persuade the IMF to relax conditions for releasing funds. Pakistan has requested U.S. help to influence the IMF to release remaining support funds, but it is unlikely that the U.S. will intervene. Repayment of IMF loans will strain Islamabad's budget due to low revenue generation and military budget emphasis. The United States is unlikely to intervene in Islamabad's request for IMF support funds. Islamabad's federal budget faces constraints due to low revenue generation and high military spending. Pakistan's 9% tax-to-GDP ratio is criticized by U.S. officials, with efforts to implement tax reforms facing parliamentary challenges. The Pakistani government's economic challenges are worsened by a heavy emphasis on military spending in the federal budget. Secretary Clinton and other U.S. officials have criticized Pakistan's low 9% tax-to-GDP ratio.

The judiciary, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" continues to battle the executive branch and pursue corruption charges against politicians, including President Zardari, amidst Pakistan's perpetual political turmoil and economic challenges. In 2010 and 2011, Pakistan faced political turmoil with threats to the PPP's government due to coalition politics. The MQM and JUI, influential parties, withdrew and rejoined the coalition multiple times over rising fuel prices and inflation. Loss of the MQM's support posed a challenge to the ruling coalition. The MQM and JUI's withdrawal and rejoining of the coalition in 2011 were driven by rising fuel prices, inflation, and government mismanagement. The MQM's 25 seats loss threatened the ruling coalition's majority, leading to fears of government collapse. The withdrawals were seen as attempts to gain more administrative control in Karachi. In May 2011, the PPP strengthened its position through a new alliance. In 2011, the MQM's withdrawal of 25 seats threatened the ruling coalition's majority, potentially causing government collapse. The PPP strengthened its position through a new alliance with the PML-Q faction, bolstering its status for the upcoming general elections.

Senate elections in February 2012 were crucial for Zardari's political safety. Allies bolstered ruling party's status, posing a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N faction. Senate elections in February 2012 ensured PPP's control through 2015. The ruling party's increased plurality allows it to block legislation despite potential losses in upcoming polls. OBL's death caused embarrassment for Pakistani military and led to domestic criticism. The ruling party's increased plurality from Senate elections in February 2012 allows it to block legislation despite potential losses in upcoming polls. OBL's death caused embarrassment for the Pakistani military and led to rare domestic criticism, creating an opening for civilian leaders to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. The embarrassment of the May 2011 Mehran naval base attack and scandals involving abuse of power and human rights led to rare domestic criticism of Pakistan's security establishment. This created an opportunity for civilian leaders to gain more control over foreign and national security policies, although there has been little action taken by civilians to capitalize on this opening. Media criticism of the security establishment continued throughout the year, with little civilian action taken to address the apparent abuse of power and human rights. Parliament did form a commission to investigate bin Laden's presence in Pakistan and American incursions, but initial lack of focus diminished hopes for increased civilian authority. Civil-military tensions were further exacerbated by the events discussed in the \"'Memogate'\" section. The commission formed by Parliament to investigate bin Laden's presence in Pakistan and American incursions lacked focus, reducing hopes for increased civilian authority. Civil-military tensions worsened, leading to fears of a military coup in late 2011.
