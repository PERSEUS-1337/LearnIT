Congress finds that Americans cherish healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the marine ecosystems of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska, which provide habitat for a variety of wildlife including endangered species like bowhead whales, beluga whales, polar bears, and seals. These ecosystems are crucial for current and future generations. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska support a diverse array of wildlife, including endangered species like bowhead whales, beluga whales, polar bears, and seals. These ecosystems are vital for the survival of Alaska Native peoples and are undergoing significant changes due to climate change. The Arctic ecosystems in Alaska are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native peoples and are experiencing significant changes due to climate change. Scientists agree that these changes are impacting sea ice habitats for species like polar bears, walrus, and seals, leading to the proposal to list the polar bear as a threatened species in 2007. In January 2007, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 due to the projected loss of sea ice jeopardizing their habitat. The polar bear relies on sea ice to hunt seals, its main food source. The Department of the Interior missed a deadline to decide on Endangered Species Act protections for polar bears in 2008. Additionally, they proceeded with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area. The Department of the Interior moved forward with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area, which is polar bear habitat. A court ruling required a decision on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. In April 2008, a court ruled that the Department of the Interior must decide on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. In September 2007, the US Geological Survey projected that changes in sea ice conditions could lead to a significant decline in the polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century. The US Geological Survey issued reports projecting a 2/3 loss of the world's polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century due to future sea ice changes. The agency also warned of potential extirpation of polar bears in Alaska, noting that current models may underestimate Arctic sea ice decline. Global warming from greenhouse gas emissions is the primary threat to polar bears, with additional concerns about oil and gas development in the Beaufort Sea. The assessment of future polar bear status may be conservative due to underestimation by current models. Global warming is the major threat to polar bears, with additional risks posed by potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Recovering spilled oil in this harsh environment is currently ineffective. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas face challenges in recovering spilled oil due to the harsh environment, especially during icy conditions. The Minerals Management Service plans to lease millions of acres in these areas, overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. The leasing plan includes offering 40 million acres in the Chukchi Sea and expanding leasing in the Beaufort Sea to 33 million acres, all overlapping with crucial polar bear habitat. The environmental impact statement for Lease Sale 193 in the Chukchi Sea warns of significant risks to the polar bear population from a large oil spill during the broken-ice period. The Minerals Management Service warns of significant risks to the polar bear population and other marine mammals from a large oil spill in the Arctic Ocean. There is a lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use. Onshore industrial development activities are necessary to support offshore oil and gas development. The agency warns of risks to marine mammals from oil spills in the Arctic Ocean. Onshore industrial activities for oil and gas development can harm important habitats and disturb wildlife. Tribal governments are concerned about the impact on subsistence resources and cultural survival. Tribal governments, including the Native Village of Point Hope and the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope, oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine and coastal ecosystems is identified by the National Research Council. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until the National Research Council identifies missing information on marine and coastal ecosystems, focusing on changes caused by climate change. The Beaufort and Chukchi Sea marine ecosystems focus on climate change impacts and support baseline information for oil and gas activities. The curr_chunk discusses the support for establishing baseline information and determining potential impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. The curr_chunk highlights the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, coastal areas, and Alaskan Native communities, including the adequacy of environmental studies conducted by the Alaska environmental studies program of the Minerals Management Service. The curr_chunk summarizes completed environmental, public health, and cultural studies conducted by the Alaska environmental studies program of the Minerals Management Service. It includes submitting a report to Congress that identifies missing information and evaluates the adequacy of ongoing and completed studies. The curr_chunk outlines the requirement to submit a report to Congress that identifies missing information, evaluates ongoing and completed studies, and makes recommendations for additional studies or research. The curr_chunk discusses the need for studies and research recommendations related to the listing of polar bears under the Endangered Species Act. The curr_chunk outlines conditions for the listing of polar bears under the Endangered Species Act, including critical habitat designation and oil spill response analysis for arctic oil operations. The Secretary may determine that listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act is not necessary. Additionally, the Secretary must conduct an oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations and establish standards for lessees to ensure environmental protection. The Secretary sets a standard for lessees to recover 85% of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition. The Secretary requires lessees to recover at least 85 percent of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition or season. Recovery standard must be demonstrated before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. The 85 percent oil recovery standard must be achieved before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans, ensuring oil spill response gap closure in any ice condition or season. The oil spill response gap closure requirements include achieving 85 percent oil recovery before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. Additionally, procedures are in place to close areas to oil and gas activity based on response gap existence, with specific requirements for oil installation, operation, and maintenance. The Secretary implements procedures to close areas to oil and gas activity due to response gap and sets requirements for oil spill prevention systems to enhance safety and reduce spill risks. The Secretary enforces measures to prevent oil spills and improve safety in oil and gas exploration activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. The National Research Council report ensures that oil and gas exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas does not harm wildlife or subsistence activities, and identifies necessary mitigation measures. The National Research Council report addresses the risk of adverse impact to wildlife and habitat from oil and gas exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas, and identifies necessary mitigation measures. The curr_chunk defines 'response gap' as a period when the oil spill recovery standard cannot be met, and 'response gap analysis' as calculating response operating limits for various environmental factors. The curr_chunk involves calculating response operating limits of spill response systems for environmental factors and assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. The curr_chunk involves assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans, considering factors that could exceed system limits when combined. Assessing factors that could exceed system limits when combined, including frequency, duration, and timing of occurrence. Based on calculations and assessments, quantify the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve oil spill recovery standards. Based on calculations and assessments, quantify the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve oil spill recovery standards."
