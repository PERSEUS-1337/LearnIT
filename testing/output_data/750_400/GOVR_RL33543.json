    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are a significant part of U.S. defense capability and spending. The current focus is on three acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Air Force F-22 fighter, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. Congress is addressing program-specific issues for these aircraft in FY2010. The U.S. military has around 3,500 tactical aircraft, with modernization efforts focused on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Air Force F-22 fighter, and Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. Congress is considering issues in FY2010 such as terminating the alternate engine for the F-35 and ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. In FY2010, Congress is considering decisions on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. This includes terminating the alternate engine for the F-35, ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, and funding for additional F-22s. Additionally, there is a decision on Navy's FY2010 funding request for nine F/A-18E/Fs and a potential multiyear procurement arrangement for F/A-18E/Fs. In FY2010, Congress is considering decisions on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, including funding for additional F-22s and Navy's request for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Program-specific issues and legislative activity are covered in CRS reports. In FY2010, Congress is considering decisions on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, including funding for additional aircraft. Program-specific issues and legislative activity are covered in CRS reports. The central issue is the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The FY2010 legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft, including the F/A-18E/F program, focuses on affordability and the future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft. Tactical aircraft refer to combat aircraft with shorter ranges that can operate within a regional theater without in-flight refueling. The future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft is a key issue. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat aircraft that can operate within a regional theater without in-flight refueling. Strategic aircraft, on the other hand, are larger and longer-ranged bombers designed for intercontinental missions. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat aircraft designed for missions within a single regional theater of operations. In contrast, strategic aircraft like B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are larger and longer-ranged for intercontinental flights. The term tactical aircraft primarily refers to fighters. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters and strike fighters, are designed for missions within a single theater of operations. Fighters are mainly for air-to-air combat, while strike fighters have dual-role capabilities. Tactical aircraft, including fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are designed for specific combat roles. Fighters are for air-to-air combat, strike fighters have dual-role capabilities, and attack planes are for air-to-ground operations. The term tactical aircraft is often shortened to tac air. Tactical aircraft, such as F/A-18E/F, are dual-role planes designed for air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. Attack planes, with an \"A\" designation like A-10, focus on air-to-ground missions. Air Force tactical aircraft operate from land bases, Navy aircraft from carriers, and Marine Corps aircraft from both ships and land bases. Marine Corps tactical aircraft can also operate from short runways on expeditionary land bases. Tactical aircraft, including CTOL and VSTOL/STOVL planes, are used by Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps for various missions like air-to-air combat and air-to-ground operations. Marine Corps aircraft can operate from both ships and land bases, including short runways on expeditionary land bases. Some Marine Corps tactical aircraft, such as VSTOL or STOVL planes, are used for air-to-air combat, air-to-ground operations, and deep interdiction missions. Strike fighters can engage in both types of operations. The Air Force conducts combat operations, including close air support for friendly ground forces, battlefield air interdiction against enemy forces, and deep interdiction targeting the enemy's infrastructure. They operate F-22 fighters, F-15 fighters, F-15E strike fighters, F-16 fighters, and A-10 aircraft for various missions. The Air Force conducts combat operations with tactical aircraft like F-22, F-15, F-16, and A-10 for various missions, including close air support and interdiction. The Navy operates F/A-18A-D and F/A-18E/F strike fighters, while the Marine Corps uses F/A-18 A-D and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. The Navy and Marine Corps operate F/A-18A-D and F/A-18E/F strike fighters, as well as AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. The Department of Defense had a total inventory of about 3,500 tactical aircraft in early 2009, with the Air Force having about 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125. Efforts for modernizing U.S. tactical aircraft focus on three main acquisition programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report in early 2009 revealed that the Department of Defense had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force owning 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having 1,125. Modernization efforts are centered around three main aircraft acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. The F-35, also known as the Lighting II, is being procured in different versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is a new, affordable fifth-generation strike fighter being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy to meet their operational needs efficiently. The F-35 program is DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to provide three services with a cost-effective fifth-generation strike fighter. It involves acquiring 2,456 JSFs at an estimated total cost of $246 billion in constant FY2009 dollars. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the three services at an estimated total cost of $246 billion in constant FY2009 dollars. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, while the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-D. The procurement of F-35s began in FY2007, with the Air Force acquiring the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, the Marine Corps getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-D, and the Navy acquiring the F-35C for carrier operations. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for 30 F-35s. The Navy is procuring the F-35C as a replacement for F/A-18A-D and AV-8B Harrier VSTOL attack planes. The proposed FY2010 budget includes funding for 30 F-35s, with 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy. The Air Force F-22 fighter, known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s includes 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities like stealth and high maneuverability. The administration plans to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. The procurement of F-22s began in FY1999, with a total of 187 aircraft procured through FY2009. The administration plans to halt F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, with no funding requested for additional F-22s in FY2010. Supporters aim to continue procurement for a total goal of 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F, also known as the Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter with enhanced capabilities compared to earlier models. The budget did not request funding for additional F-22s in FY2010. Supporters aim to procure 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F, also known as the Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter with advanced capabilities, considered a fourth-generation aircraft. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a fourth-generation aircraft with some fifth-generation technology. It is a core part of the Navy's aircraft carrier air wings, with over 40 Hornets and Super Hornets in each wing. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. The Navy's aircraft carrier air wings consist of over 40 Hornets and Super Hornets each. The Navy has been acquiring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortfalls, with projections of up to 800 aircraft by 2024 for the Air Force and over 100 aircraft by 2018 for the Navy. Some question the accuracy of these projections, suggesting they are influenced by assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual warfighting needs. The Air Force and Navy are dealing with fighter aircraft shortfalls, with projections of up to 800 aircraft by 2024 for the Air Force and over 100 aircraft by 2018 for the Navy. These projections are influenced by assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual warfighting needs. The peak size of the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on assumptions about service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This plan does not include the retirement of five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This plan excludes the retirement of five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The Air Force's combat air forces restructuring plan involves retiring 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to fund a smaller and more capable force for higher priority missions. This plan excludes the retirement of five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire 250 older aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, to prioritize higher missions. This strategic move will transition legacy fighters and F-22 Raptors into a more flexible and lethal force, serving as a bridge to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley highlighted the strategic opportunity for fighter aircraft restructuring, aiming to convert legacy fighters and F-22 Raptors into a smaller, more flexible, and lethal force as a bridge to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years will be used to reduce capability gaps and invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters. The Air Force plans to use cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years to reduce capability gaps. The funds will be invested in advanced capability modifications for remaining fighters and bombers, procuring munitions for joint warfighters, and sustaining critical intelligence capabilities.

The Air Force plans to reinvigorate its nuclear enterprise and deploy 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11 to meet current and future mission requirements. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a long-standing concern in Congress and elsewhere. Observers predict a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not meet acquisition plans for tactical aircraft. The issue was previously focused on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production winds down, it may shift to other areas. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a long-standing concern in Congress and elsewhere, as plans collide with insufficient funding for aircraft acquisition. The issue was previously focused on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production winds down, it may shift to the affordability of the F-35 program as DOD aims to increase procurement rates. The affordability of the F-35 program is a concern as DOD plans to increase procurement rates. Reductions in planned aircraft acquisitions have lowered costs since the 1990s. Since the early 1990s, DOD has reduced the planned number of new aircraft acquisitions for the Air Force and Navy, lowering costs. The Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan further decreased planned procurements by integrating strike fighter inventories. The Air Force and Navy have reduced planned aircraft acquisitions. The Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan integrated strike fighter inventories, leading to further reductions in procurements. The F-35 program aims to lower costs for developing, procuring, and operating tactical aircraft. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft through the acquisition of a strike fighter that can be procured in three versions for the three services. However, it is uncertain if the Department of Defense's tactical aircraft modernization plan will be affordable given future defense budget constraints. The Department of Defense's tactical aircraft modernization plan may not be affordable due to future defense budget constraints, potentially leading to a shortfall in Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps strike fighters. Policymakers may need to reduce funding for other DOD programs to fully fund the modernization plans. The Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall may indicate challenges in affording tactical aircraft modernization. Policymakers may need to choose between funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs or non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. Examples include Army and Navy surface-to-air missile systems. Policymakers may face funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions, such as surface-to-air missile systems and other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters. Funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and long-range aircraft due to improvements in regional anti-access capabilities. Some argue for less emphasis on tactical aircraft and more on long-range aircraft. Some argue for shifting funding emphasis from tactical aircraft to long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities. This includes funding for different mission aircraft like airlift, refueling tankers, electronic attack, airborne warning, and surveillance aircraft. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans is a subset of a larger issue. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans is a subset of a larger issue concerning the procurement of new aircraft of all types, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). UAVs have been increasingly used for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. DOD plans to prioritize UAVs and UCAVs for irregular warfare operations, focusing on improving capabilities for ground-attack missions and precision strikes on terrorist targets. The DOD plans to prioritize UAVs and UCAVs for ground-attack missions and precision strikes on terrorist targets, with a focus on improving capabilities for irregular warfare operations. Funding comparisons between land-based Air Force tactical aircraft and sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft acquisition programs are being discussed by observers. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 has sparked debates on funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft (F-22 vs. F-35A) and sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft (F/A-18E/F vs. F-35 B/C). Observers are discussing the relative capabilities and costs of these aircraft for various missions. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft has sparked debates on funding for land-based tactical aircraft (F-22 vs. F-35A) and sea-based tactical aircraft (F/A-18E/F vs. F-35 B/C). Discussions include the relative capabilities and costs of these aircraft for different missions. Funding for procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs is compared to funding for service life extensions of existing tactical aircraft. The proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A instead is a tradeoff example by the DOD. It compares funding for F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs to service life extensions of existing tactical aircraft or procuring upgraded models. Examples include upgraded F-15s instead of more F-22s, upgraded F-16s instead of some F-35As, and additional F/A-18E/Fs instead of some F-35Cs and Bs. The DOD's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A involves tradeoffs between funding for different aircraft models. This includes considering life extensions of older tactical aircraft or acquiring upgraded versions. Examples include upgrading F-15s instead of more F-22s, F-16s instead of some F-35As, and additional F/A-18E/Fs instead of some F-35Cs and Bs. These tradeoffs raise questions about costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility, which have been extensively studied and debated in the context of U.S. military goals and objectives. The potential tradeoffs between funding for different aircraft models, such as life extensions of older aircraft versus procuring new ones, raise questions about costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility. These issues have been extensively studied and debated in the context of U.S. military goals and objectives, which are currently under review in the Quadrennial Defense Review. One key issue being considered is the emphasis on preparing for irregular warfare operations. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is reviewing U.S. military goals and objectives, including the emphasis on preparing for irregular warfare operations versus conventional conflict. The need for large quantities of high-capability tactical aircraft is being questioned in the post-Cold War era. In the post-Cold War era, there is a debate on the need for high-capability tactical aircraft for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. Some suggest reducing procurement of these aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs and UCAVs. Some argue against high-capability tactical aircraft for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations, favoring investments in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, medical evacuation aircraft, and forward air controllers. Others believe these the aircraft are still necessary due to potential adversaries with Russian aircraft and SAMs. Investments in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, medical evacuation aircraft, and training forward air controllers are favored for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. However, some argue that high-capability tactical aircraft are still necessary due to potential adversaries with Russian aircraft and SAMs. Recent acquisitions of advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs by China and India have raised concerns among observers. Some European and Asian companies may soon market advanced aircraft and SAMs to potential adversaries, despite the end of the Cold War. Concerns have been raised about China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles, potentially challenging U.S. airpower in the future. Large numbers of advanced aircraft are seen as crucial for operational success in conflicts with well-armed adversaries. Representative Neil Abercrombie has requested further information on this issue. Some observers are concerned that European and Asian countries could challenge U.S. airpower in the future with advanced aircraft. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the military's plan to spend $109.3 billion on 570 new tactical aircraft in the next 7 years at the request of Representative Neil Abercrombie. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the military's plan to spend $109.3 billion on acquiring 570 new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones over the next 7 years. Significant cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have led to reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The military plans to acquire 570 new tactical aircraft and modernize existing ones, but cost increases, schedule delays, and changing requirements have reduced procurement quantities. The development of the F-22A faced doubled timelines, increased costs, and decreased procurement numbers. Similar challenges are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), crucial for future modernization efforts. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is facing cost increases and schedule delays, with development costs up by $31.6 billion since 2004. This is impacting the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure, similar to challenges faced by the F-22A. Funding for new and legacy aircraft is interdependent, with legacy systems needing to be sustained until new systems are operational. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is facing cost increases and schedule delays, with development costs up by $31.6 billion since 2004. Legacy systems must be sustained until new systems are ready to replace them, requiring additional funding to ensure the total force remains capable and sufficient in numbers. The uncertainty surrounding new systems costs and deliveries poses challenges in effectively planning and implementing modernization efforts and legacy retirement schedules. The services are currently investing an average of $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years, but there are significant unfunded requirements and potential costs. The services are investing about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years, with significant unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft are approaching, and DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. DOD faces decisions on retiring or extending legacy aircraft, lacking a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Each military service operates independently in planning and acquiring resources, leading to potential capability gaps or duplication. The military services lack a unified view of requirements for fighter and attack aircraft, leading to potential capability gaps and duplication. Each service operates independently to acquire resources for their specific force structures, resulting in underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding. The military services have underperformed in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels, as individual service plans rely on unrealistic assumptions about new acquisitions and funding levels. Future plans for military services may be unaffordable within projected funding levels due to unrealistic assumptions about new acquisitions and funding levels, especially with the projected decline in future federal discretionary spending. The projected decline in future federal discretionary spending may make future military service plans unaffordable, especially with the looming start-ups of big-ticket defense items competing for funds. GAO recommends that DOD recapitalize and sustain tactical air forces in a joint service perspective. Recent efforts to examine joint requirements on an integrated, DOD-wide basis have not significantly affected service plans and investments. GAO recommends that DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing and delivering new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated enterprise-level investment strategy for tactical air forces. GAO recommends that DOD shorten cycle times for developing new tactical aircraft and create an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on fighter capabilities and costs under DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2009 plans. The study compares seven alternative approaches for modernizing fighter forces to maintain inventory levels called for by current service requirements. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study comparing seven alternative approaches for modernizing fighter forces to maintain inventory levels required by current service needs. The report, issued in May 2009, highlights the potential increase in capability if the services' goals for modernizing their fighter forces are realized over the next few decades. The report from May 2009 discusses the modernization goals of the fighter force, aiming for significant capability increase with state-of-the-art aircraft offering advanced technology like increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities. The modernized fleets of fighter aircraft will have state-of-the-art technology with increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities, enhancing survivability. Despite DoD's focus on greater flight endurance, the unrefueled ranges of newer aircraft may not increase significantly. Fighter inventories are expected to fall below goals in the coming years, but overall capabilities will remain strong. Despite DoD's emphasis on fielding aviation forces with greater flight endurance, the unrefueled ranges of newer aircraft may not increase significantly. Fighter inventories are expected to fall below goals in the coming years, but overall capabilities will remain strong due to enhanced lethality and survivability expected from the new fighters. Some improvements may be offset by the increased capabilities of potential adversaries. Many aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to enhanced lethality and survivability of new fighters, although potential adversaries may have increased capabilities. Alternative approaches like purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements, especially in survivability. Purchasing upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle could offer short-term inventory relief and cost savings, albeit with lesser capability improvements compared to buying JSFs. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would provide improved basing flexibility and persistence. Forces with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft can maintain air-to-ground weapons capacities at similar costs to current plans, although with fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Force structures that replace fighters with attack aircraft can provide air-to-ground weapons capacities comparable to current plans at similar costs. However, this may result in fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Congress also needs to consider the impact of tactical aircraft acquisition decisions on the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. The implications of tactical aircraft acquisition decisions on the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry are a concern for Congress. This industry employs thousands of designers, engineers, and production workers at major aircraft manufacturing firms. Decisions on acquisition programs can impact employment levels and the industry's structure, with Lockheed being one of the active prime contractors for tactical aircraft production. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact employment levels and the industry's structure. The United States currently has two active prime contractors for tactical aircraft production - Lockheed and Boeing. Concerns have been raised about the potential reduction to one prime contractor (Lockheed) when F/A-18E/F production winds down. The production of tactical aircraft by Lockheed and Boeing may be reduced to one prime contractor (Lockheed) when F/A-18E/F production ends. Concerns have been raised about the impact on competition, innovation, pricing, and quality in future U.S. tactical aircraft development and procurement. The potential reduction to one prime contractor for tactical aircraft production (Lockheed) raises concerns about competition, innovation, pricing, and quality in future U.S. procurement. Congress may need to consider the number of prime contractors needed, the value of competition, and Boeing's role in preserving key skills.

It also mentions an exception for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010 and expresses Congress's findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure. The text discusses Congress's findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure, stating the requirement for not less than 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike fighter aircraft each. The Navy must maintain at least 11 operational aircraft carriers, which means having not less than 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike fighter aircraft each. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation aircraft, most of the carrier air wing's strike fighters will not be fifth-generation assets. Congress acknowledges the importance of these forces. The Navy must maintain at least 11 operational aircraft carriers with 10 carrier air wings, each consisting of not less than 44 strike fighter aircraft. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation aircraft, the majority of the strike fighters in a carrier air wing will not be fifth-generation assets. Congress recognizes the significance of these forces. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2647 emphasizes the need for the Navy to maintain at least 10 carrier air wings with not less than 44 strike fighter aircraft in each wing, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The Secretary of the Navy is urged to allocate resources to ensure this requirement is met.

Various factors contribute to this shortfall, including a decision made in fiscal year 2002. The committee predicts a fiscal year 2010 shortfall of 152 aircraft, with a potential peak strike-fighter shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include decisions made in fiscal year 2002 and delays in the development of certain aircraft programs. The committee finds these naval strike-fighter shortfalls unacceptable. The committee remains concerned about naval strike-fighter shortfalls, citing decisions made in fiscal year 2002 to reduce inventory and delays in aircraft program development. They emphasize the importance of matching carrier air wings to support sufficient naval aviation capabilities. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate naval strike-fighter inventory shortfalls and believes a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than acquiring new aircraft. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address naval strike-fighter inventory shortages. The committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address naval strike-fighter inventory shortages. Additionally, there is a provision in the Act to maintain at least ten carrier air wings with no less than 44 strike-fighters each. The committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address naval strike-fighter inventory shortages. Congress expresses the need for the Department of the Navy to maintain at least ten carrier air wings with no less than 44 strike-fighters each. Additionally, a report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of existing F/A-18A through D aircraft versus procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Congressional Budget Office was tasked with evaluating the costs and effectiveness of extending the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft to 10,000 flight hours versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report highlighted the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report on the F/A-18E/F program expresses concern about the Navy facing a significant aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The Navy is facing a fighter shortfall as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee is disappointed with the Navy's failure to provide a report on procurement costs. The Navy is facing a fighter shortfall as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee is disappointed with the Navy's failure to provide a report on procurement costs, specifically comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated by committee reports. Last year, the Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which increases to 125 when including requirements of the United States Marine Corps. The Navy is facing a projected shortfall in tactical aviation, with a potential gap of up to 250 aircraft according to the Chief of Naval Operations. The committee believes the Navy's budget for fiscal year 2010 does not effectively address this issue. The committee is concerned about the Navy's projected shortfall of up to 250 aircraft in its tactical air fleet for fiscal year 2010. They believe the Navy's budget does not adequately address this issue and could pose a risk to national security. The shortfall is based on assumptions regarding the F-35C's initial operation capability in 2015. The committee is concerned about the Navy's projected shortfall of up to 250 aircraft in its tactical air fleet for fiscal year 2010, which poses a risk to national security. The Navy's delay in taking action to address this shortfall is worrisome as it remains reliant on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s. The Navy's delay in addressing the projected shortfall of up to 250 aircraft in its tactical air fleet is concerning. It is overly reliant on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s and not considering realistic long-range procurement plans. The Navy is relying on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s instead of considering realistic long-range procurement plans to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall. The Navy is increasingly relying on a costly proposal to extend the life of select legacy F/A-18's from 8,600 to 10,000 flight hours through a SLEP, despite uncertainties about the number of planes capable of reaching 10,000 flight hours. The committee is concerned about the risky cost uncertainties of this plan. The Navy plans to extend the service life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours, but there are uncertainties about how many planes can reach that goal. The committee is concerned about the risky cost uncertainties of this plan and believes that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more cost-effective. The committee is concerned about the risky cost uncertainties of extending the service life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours. They believe that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more cost-effective, with new planes costing less than $50.0 million each in 2009 constant dollars. A SLEP to achieve an additional 1,400 flight hours would cost approximately $18,571 per flight hour gained, versus $8,333 per flight hour provided by a new F/A\u201318E/F. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities, including active electronically scanned array radar. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models come equipped with improved technological capabilities, including active electronically scanned array radar, modernized avionics, advanced aerial refueling system capability, and added weapon hard points. The Navy projects that the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040, with advanced features like electronically scanned array radar, modernized avionics, and added weapon hard points. This increases the benefit of purchasing new F/A-18E/Fs over conducting a SLEP on legacy aircraft. The Department of Defense plans to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. The Navy plans to keep the F/A-18E/F in the fleet until 2040, with advanced features. The Department of Defense will review tactical aircraft forces in the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects analysis on multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, including cost differences and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. The Department is expected to analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, including cost differences and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements.

The report addresses the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to sustained overseas operations. The report addresses the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall caused by sustained overseas operations, leading to the aging of the F-18 variant aircraft at a faster rate than planned for the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. The Department of the Navy's F-18 aircraft fleet is aging faster than planned due to high operational tempo, leading to critical shortfalls in strike fighter inventory. Delays in the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II have worsened the shortfall, with a peak predicted at 125 aircraft in fiscal year 2017. The Navy is forecasting critical shortfalls in its strike fighter inventory, with the shortfall now over 200 aircraft due to delays in the F-35 introduction and issues with the life extension of older F-18 aircraft. The Navy's strike fighter inventory shortfall is now over 200 aircraft, attributed to delays in the F-35 introduction and challenges with extending the life of older F-18 aircraft. Despite a reduction in F-18 purchases for fiscal year 2010, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft remains open. The Navy has reduced the number of F-18 aircraft being purchased in fiscal year 2010, moving the tactical aircraft inventory in the opposite direction of what is expected during a shortage. The production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The fiscal year 2010 aircraft are being purchased as standalone, annually priced procurement, with a substantial unit price difference compared to multi-year procurement. The Navy is not entering into another multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft, missing out on significant savings and the opportunity to mitigate the strike fighter shortfall. The Navy is missing out on significant savings and the opportunity to mitigate the strike fighter shortfall by not entering into another multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft. The recommendation provides $108,000,000 above the request for the procurement of long lead equipment in an economic order quantity and cost reduction initiatives for a five year, 150 aircraft multi-year procurement for the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G programs. The recommendation suggests significant savings through a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft, providing $108,000,000 above the request for long lead equipment. An additional $495,000,000 is allocated for nine more F/A-18E/F Aircraft to address the strike fighter shortfall. The recommendation allocates $495,000,000 for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18E/F Aircraft to address the Navy's strike fighter shortfall caused by aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The shortfall is currently estimated to be at least 129 aircraft. The Navy is facing a fighter shortfall due to aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 program. The shortfall is estimated to be at least 129 aircraft, with a potential increase if extending the F/A-18's life is too costly. To address this, the Committee provides an additional $512,280,000 to procure nine F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010.
