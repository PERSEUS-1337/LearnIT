    "content": "The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying equal protection of the laws to any person within their jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has extended equal protection principles to apply to the federal government as well. When courts review government actions that differentiate between classes of people, they apply varying levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved. When courts review governmental action that distinguishes between classes of people, they apply different levels of scrutiny under the Constitution's equal protection guarantees. The level of scrutiny depends on the classification involved, with higher scrutiny for more suspect classifications. There are three levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Increased scrutiny raises the likelihood of a court finding the action unconstitutional. The level of scrutiny applied by courts in evaluating government classifications depends on the level of discrimination involved. There are three levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review and applies to classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applying to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Courts consider historical discrimination, minority status with unchangeable characteristics, or inadequate political protection to determine suspect classifications, such as those based on race, national origin, and alienage. When applying strict scrutiny to governmental action, reviewing courts consider if the action is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny, showing that less discriminatory means cannot achieve its goals. When applying strict scrutiny to governmental action, reviewing courts consider if the action is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government bears the burden of proving the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny, showing that it cannot achieve its goals via less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny is less searching than strict scrutiny and applies to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy. Intermediate scrutiny is less searching than strict scrutiny, applying to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications such as gender or illegitimacy. Courts determine if governmental action is substantially related to an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny, with the government bearing the burden of proving constitutional validity. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny. Courts apply intermediate scrutiny to governmental action to determine if it is substantially related to achieving an important government interest. The government bears the burden of proving constitutional validity under this scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened scrutiny. Governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive rational basis review. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. Governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive this review. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and the action only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose to pass rational basis review. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, as courts presume governmental actions subject to this review are constitutionally valid. Parties challenging such actions bear the burden of proving their invalidity. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, prohibiting the government from depriving a person of \"life, liberty, or property\" without due process of law. The Fifth Amendment applies to actions by the federal government. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, ensuring that the government cannot deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without following certain procedural requirements. The Fifth Amendment applies to federal government actions, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action. The Fifth Amendment applies to federal government actions, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action. The Constitution's due process language prohibits the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following specific procedures. Substantive due process also protects fundamental rights from undue government interference. Substantive due process includes guarantees against government actions that burden liberty interests, protecting fundamental rights from undue infringement. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest, showing a substantial need for furtherance of that interest without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must show a substantial need for its action to further a compelling interest without burdening fundamental rights more than necessary. The Court has recognized rights such as the right to have children, use contraception, and marry. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. In Obergefell, the Court considered the constitutionality of state same-sex marriage bans, resolving a circuit split on the issue. In Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruled that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states, based on due process and equal protection principles. The Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges, citing due process and equal protection principles. States must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize their marriages. The decision was based on the fundamental right to marry, which applies equally to same-sex couples. The Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges, citing due process and equal protection principles. The Court recognized the fundamental right to marry as constitutionally protected for same-sex couples, based on reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and marriage's importance. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and marriage's importance in the nation's social order. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing marriage as a keystone of the nation's social order with no distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples in states conferring benefits. The Court departed from precedent by recognizing same-sex couples' right to marry based on individual autonomy and the importance of committed unions. The Court acknowledged its departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights, stating that rights are not solely based on historical practices but also on a modern understanding of constitutional imperatives. The Court departed from precedent by recognizing that rights are not solely based on historical practices but also on a modern understanding of constitutional imperatives, including the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, diverging from previous approaches. The Court recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry but did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, diverging from previous approaches. States argued for bans on same-sex marriage to wait and see how the debate progresses. The Court recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry but did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. States argued for bans on same-sex marriage to wait and see how the debate progresses, without the Court considering if the bans were narrowly tailored to these justifications. The Court invalidated state same-sex marriage bans, recognizing the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples without applying strict scrutiny. The Court did not consider if the bans were narrowly tailored to justifications such as changing marriage norms or incentivizing couples to stay together during child rearing. The Court invalidated state same-sex marriage bans, recognizing the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples without applying strict scrutiny. The Court did not consider if the bans were narrowly tailored to justifications such as changing marriage norms or incentivizing couples to stay together during child rearing. The Court held that both equal protection and due process guarantees protect the fundamental right to marry, and that states can no longer deny this right to same-sex couples. The Court did not mention the proper level of scrutiny applicable to classifications based on sexual orientation. Some dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the majority overstepped by removing the question of same-sex couples' right to marry from democratic processes. The Court in Obergefell did not specify the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. Dissenting Justices believed the majority should not have decided on same-sex marriage, as it should have been resolved through the democratic process. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed that the issue of same-sex marriage should have been resolved through the democratic process, not by the Supreme Court establishing a fundamental right. They were concerned that the majority went beyond history and tradition to make their decision. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell disagreed with the majority's decision to establish a fundamental right for same-sex marriage, believing it should have been resolved through the democratic process. They argued that the majority disregarded the importance of tradition and history in determining constitutional protection for rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about its broader impact on gay individuals' rights and the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about its broader impact on gay individuals' rights, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, and the implications for laws prohibiting plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about its impact on gay individuals' rights, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, and laws prohibiting plural marriages. The decision appears limited to the marriage context, with its holding resting entirely on same-sex marriage bans. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about its impact on gay individuals' rights, specifically whether it extends beyond the marriage context. The decision's holding was based on same-sex marriage bans infringing upon the fundamental right to marry, without addressing heightened scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell focused on same-sex marriage bans violating the right to marry, without addressing heightened scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications. If the Court had applied heightened scrutiny, it could have broader implications for gay individuals' rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell did not address heightened scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications, which could have broader implications for gay individuals' rights. Before Obergefell, federal appeals courts were divided on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth Circuit held that such classifications warrant heightened scrutiny, but did not specify if it was intermediate or strict scrutiny. The Second Circuit's stance on this issue was not mentioned. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth Circuit and Second Circuit consider such classifications as warranting heightened scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit does not specify a heightened level of scrutiny. The Second Circuit and Ninth Circuit view classifications based on sexual orientation as quasi-suspect, subject to intermediate scrutiny. In contrast, the Sixth Circuit does not consider such classifications as suspect or quasi-suspect, applying only rational basis review. The Court's decision in Obergefell, focusing on the right to marry, may not resolve the circuit split on this issue. The Court's decision in Obergefell focused on the fundamental right to marry, leaving unresolved the circuit split on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. This ambiguity allows for future lower courts to address the issue, potentially leading to varied approaches among circuit courts. The circuit split on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation remains unresolved. Lower courts may apply heightened scrutiny or rational basis review to laws that classify based on sexual orientation in the future. The circuit split on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation remains unresolved. Some lower courts may apply heightened scrutiny to laws that classify based on sexual orientation, potentially leading to different outcomes in constitutional challenges. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the fundamental right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting potential legalization. The classification based on sexual orientation could lead to differing outcomes in constitutional challenges depending on the evaluating court. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the fundamental right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting potential legalization. The majority's opinion in Obergefell seems crafted to limit its reach to same-sex marriage and prevent extending the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The majority's opinion in Obergefell appears to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, potentially preventing the legalization of plural marriages. Some argue that distinctions between plural and same-sex marriages could prevent extending the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples in Obergefell. Some believe this ruling may not apply to plural marriages, but others argue that aspects of the opinion could potentially support extending constitutional protections to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the right to marry to same-sex couples. Some believe this ruling may not apply to plural marriages, but others argue that aspects of the opinion could potentially support extending constitutional protections to plural marriages. The Court's departure from precedent in considering individual autonomy and family in the context of same-sex marriage could influence future decisions on the recognition of fundamental rights. The Obergefell decision departed from precedent by considering factors beyond historical recognition to determine fundamental rights. This shift may lead to a broader definition of fundamental rights in future cases. The Court did not specify the level of judicial review applied to state laws. The Obergefell decision expanded the definition of fundamental rights beyond historical recognition, potentially affecting the level of judicial review for state same-sex marriage bans. This raises questions about the appropriate scrutiny for government actions infringing on fundamental rights. The Obergefell decision expanded fundamental rights to include same-sex marriage, leading to questions about the level of judicial scrutiny for government actions infringing on these rights. This ambiguity could impact the government's ability to interfere with fundamental rights."
