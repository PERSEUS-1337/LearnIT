    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. Applicants must demonstrate that the project will not violate NAAQS to receive a \"Permit to Construct.\" To obtain a \"Permit to Construct\" for a new or modified source of air pollution, applicants must show compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations. This preconstruction review process is known as New Source Review. The New Source Review (NSR) process ensures that new sources of air pollution do not violate NAAQS or PSD regulations. It is triggered for sources potentially emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Specific requirements depend on the affected sources. The New Source Review (NSR) process is triggered for new sources potentially emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Specific requirements depend on whether the sources are subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. Sources covered by PSD must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined on a case-by-case basis. The NSR requirements for affected sources depend on whether they are subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. PSD sources must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) while non-attainment sources must install Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain offsets. Both BACT and LAER must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS. Despite NSR's broad coverage, few preconstruction permits have been issued. The NSR requirements for affected sources depend on whether they are subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. If covered by non-attainment provisions, the source is required to install LAER and obtain offsets for that area. Few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants over the program's history, which is not surprising given the steady U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity. The lack of preconstruction permits for coal-fired power plants is not surprising given the steady U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity. Emissions trends for electric utilities confirm the static situation with respect to coal-fired capacity. Emissions trends for electric utilities show a generally static situation with respect to coal-fired capacity. NOx emissions have remained constant over the last decade, while SO2 emissions saw a significant drop in 1995 due to the acid rain control program. Emissions of NOx from coal-fired electric generating facilities have remained constant over the last ten years. In contrast, SO2 emissions saw a significant drop in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments, requiring powerplants to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels. This led to a reduction in SO2 emissions from 10 million tons in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995. Additionally, many units installed Low-NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. The powerplants were required to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels specified in the title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments. Many units installed Low-NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. The affected phase 1 units emitted about 10 million tons of SO2 in 1990, reduced to 5.3 million tons in 1995. The NOx provisions reduced emissions by about 0.4 million tons in 1996. However, some of the reductions achieved under title IV were offset by increases in emissions from other plants. The NOx provisions reduced emissions by about 0.4 million tons in 1996, but some reductions were offset by increases in emissions from other plants. Title IV led to a 4.7 million ton reduction in SO2 by 1995, but overall emissions only decreased by about 3.6 million tons. Similarly, the reduction in NOx was only about 0.1 million tons despite a 0.4 million ton reduction under title IV. This slippage is expected as phase 1 does not cover all coal-fired facilities. Despite a 4.7 million ton reduction in SO2 emissions by 1995 and a 0.4 million ton reduction in NOx by 1996, overall emissions only decreased by 3.6 million tons and 0.1 million tons respectively. This discrepancy is due to phase 1 not covering all coal-fired facilities, leading to some sources of increasing emissions within the industry. Despite a lack of new plant construction, existing coal-fired facilities continue to operate, as shown in Figure 2. The continuing operation of existing coal-fired facilities has led to an increase in coal-fired electricity generation and related coal consumption over the past decade, despite the lack of new plant construction. Utilities are optimizing the performance of aging coal-fired facilities, moving them from baseload to cycling to maintain efficiency. Over the past decade, coal-fired electricity generation and related coal consumption have increased due to utilities optimizing the performance of aging facilities. Contrary to expectations, the efficiency of coal-fired units has not decreased, suggesting a fundamental change in plant maintenance economics. The efficiency of coal-fired units has not decreased over the past decade, indicating a shift in plant maintenance economics. The question raised by EPA lawsuits is whether increased spending on maintaining coal-fired capacity represents routine maintenance or a major modification. The EPA lawsuits question whether increased spending on maintaining coal-fired capacity represents routine maintenance or a major modification under the CAA, impacting the installation of pollution control equipment. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires pollution control equipment to be installed for \"major modifications\" during maintenance of facilities. Utilities are avoiding the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants due to CAA regulations. The industry is increasingly focusing on plant economics, which may intensify in the future. Utilities are hesitant to use the term \"life extension\" for old power plant spending due to Clean Air Act regulations. Plants built before 1971 are exempt from emission restrictions, but modifications can cause them to lose this exemption. The 1970 Clean Air Act requires power plants built after August 1971 to restrict emissions of pollutants like sulfur dioxide. Plants constructed before 1971 are exempt, but can lose this exemption if they are modified in a major way. Regulatory activities are ongoing regarding electricity generation and air quality. Regulatory activities regarding electricity generation and air quality include the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, revised Ozone NAAQS, NSPS for NOx for electric utilities, initiatives by the Ozone Transport Commission, and legislative initiatives. NSR enforcement is important as it is a primary permitting and enforcement tool for stationary sources. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are an attempt to enforce existing laws and regulations, not add new ones. NSR actions are fundamentally different from other regulatory activities related to air quality and electricity generation. EPA has explicitly stated that NSR enforcement is handled by a different office within the agency. NSR is a primary enforcement tool used by the Department of Justice/EPA to enforce existing laws and regulations, not create new ones. The enforcement actions under NSR are separate from regulatory development activities and are handled by a different office within EPA. EPA's enforcement actions under NSR are a result of an examination of coal-fired utilities that began in late 1996. The attractiveness of NSR as an enforcement tool lies in the remedial actions that EPA can seek the court to impose on affected utilities. The EPA's enforcement actions under NSR are not linked to regulatory development activities. The action stems from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. NSR allows EPA to seek court-imposed remedial actions, including monetary penalties and installation of the latest pollution control technology like flue-gas desulfurization units for SO2 emissions. The EPA can impose monetary penalties and require affected sources to install the latest pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization units for SO2 emissions. This could involve installing scrubbers on coal-fired utility boilers to meet reduction requirements. Additionally, new NOx NSPS for utility boilers may require the installation of selective catalytic reduction units to reduce emissions by 70-90%. The EPA can impose penalties and require pollution control technology like flue-gas desulfurization units (scrubbers) on coal-fired utility boilers. New NOx NSPS for utility boilers may mandate selective catalytic reduction units to reduce emissions by 70-90%. These controls could lead to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from powerplants. The EPA can impose penalties and require pollution control technology like flue-gas desulfurization units on coal-fired utility boilers to reduce emissions by 70-90%. Administrator Browner stated that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from powerplants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, equivalent to taking 26 million cars off the road and reducing acid rain by 15 percent. The focus on NSR reflects a belief in the importance of reducing emissions from aging coal-fired plants. The focus on NSR reflects a belief that continuing operation of aging coal-fired plants is a cost-effective alternative to constructing new capacity in the competitive generating market of a restructured industry. This could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15 percent. The agency [EPA] is taking legal action against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades, indicating a trend of extending the life of aging coal-fired plants under electric utility restructuring. This trend could be mitigated by requiring Best Available Control Technology (BACT) through New Source Review (NSR) to address environmental effects. A restructured industry could further encourage the trend of renovating existing coal-fired capacity, with potential environmental effects mitigated by requiring Best Available Control Technology (BACT) through New Source Review (NSR). The EPA is taking legal action against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades, signaling a trend of extending the life of aging coal-fired plants. This trend has been increasing in the industry for almost two decades, with potential emissions impacts recognized early on but not enforced until October 1988. The EPA struggled to enforce NSR on existing coal-fired facilities due to budget constraints and the challenge of defining a major modification. The term \"modification\" was first used in the Clean Air Act in October 1988. The EPA faced challenges enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired facilities due to budget constraints and defining major modifications. The term \"modification\" was introduced in the Clean Air Act in 1988. The Clean Air Act (CAA) introduced the term \"modification\" in 1970, defining it as any physical or operational change increasing air pollutant emissions. EPA regulations later specified it as any change resulting in an increase in maximum hourly emission rate. Additionally, replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital costs of a new facility also constituted a modification. In subsequent regulations, EPA defined modification as any physical or operational change that resulted in an increase in the maximum hourly emission rate of any controlled air pollutant. The focus shifted from enforcing emission rates to compliance with NAAQS and PSD in 1977 with the advent of NSR. EPA defined \"significant\" in promulgating regulations for the PSD and non-attainment programs. The EPA defined \"significant\" increase in emissions in terms of tons per year emitted by a major source, with thresholds set at 40 tons for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Facilities exceeding these thresholds are subject to NSR, although enforcing them has proven challenging. EPA's NSPS program also sets thresholds for compliance. The EPA's thresholds for significant emissions increases are set at 40 tons per year for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, triggering NSR requirements for facilities exceeding these limits. However, enforcing these thresholds has been challenging. The NSPS program also establishes compliance thresholds, but they do not effectively constrain utilities' life extension efforts, which mainly focus on improving unit availability and reliability without increasing maximum hourly emission rates or exceeding cost thresholds. Most life extension efforts under the NSPS program do not pose practical constraints on utilities. These efforts aim to enhance the availability and reliability of generating units without increasing their maximum hourly emission rate or exceeding cost thresholds. However, the NSR review process is more sensitive to increases in pollutant output, which may occur due to improved availability and reliability. The challenge lies in measuring these changes and establishing baselines, leading to issues in the late 1980s. The NSR review process is more sensitive to increases in pollutant output due to life extension activities, leading to challenges in measuring changes and establishing baselines. In the late 1980s, the EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension efforts, such as the Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) project. In the late 1980s, the EPA enforced NSR against facilities like Wisconsin Electric Power Company for life extension projects. EPA modified the emissions trigger in 1992 to compare actual emissions before and after modifications. After EPA enforcement of NSR in the late 1980s, the emissions trigger was modified in 1992 for electric utilities. The new test compares a facility's actual emissions before and after modifications using a 2-year average emission rate. Future actual emissions are based on projected rates and historical data. The NSR regulations for utility plants require comparing actual emissions before and after modifications. Future actual emissions are based on projected rates and historical data. EPA excludes routine maintenance, repair, and replacement from being considered modifications. Increases in production rates without capital expenditures are also not considered modifications. Utilities responded to EPA's inquiries about their life extension activities. Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to align with routine maintenance schedules, replacing the term \"life extension\" with terms like capital improvement and performance improvement in response to EPA regulations on modifications for utility plants. Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to align with routine maintenance schedules, replacing the term \"life extension\" with terms like capital improvement and performance improvement in response to EPA regulations on modifications for utility plants. The term \"life extension\" has been replaced with terms like capital improvement, performance improvement, unit integrity, condition assessment, and asset management, with the commonly used term now being rehabilitation program. By integrating life extension efforts into facilities' operation and maintenance schedules, utilities aim to distinguish between \"modification\" and routine maintenance. The term \"life extension\" has been replaced with terms like capital improvement, performance improvement, unit integrity, condition assessment, and asset management, with the commonly used term now being rehabilitation program. The distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" is effectively blurred by integrating life extension efforts into facilities' operation and maintenance schedules. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act for instances of \"new construction\" of coal-fired capacity by investor-owned utilities. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce the Clean Air Act's New Source Review requirements for instances of \"new construction\" of coal-fired capacity by investor-owned utilities and modifications to existing coal-fired facilities. The distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" is blurred, with no early resolution expected. EPA has issued a Compliance Order regarding modifications by the Tennessee Valley Authority of its coal-fired power plants. EPA has issued a Compliance Order concerning modifications by the Tennessee Valley Authority of its coal-fired power plants that should have triggered new source reviews. Tables 3, 4, and 5 identify facilities cited for violating NSR requirements and types of rehabilitations considered modifications by EPA. The Justice Department/EPA has cited facilities for violating NSR requirements and seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for modifications that trigger the \"modification\" criterion for NSR. Additional complaints may be issued as investigations proceed. The Justice Department/EPA has cited facilities for violating NSR requirements and seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for modifications that trigger the \"modification\" criterion for NSR. Complaints may be modified or new ones issued as investigations progress, with penalties of up to $25,000 per day. Defendants are required to comply with CAA requirements, remedy past NSR violations by installing BACT, apply for permits, and audit operations for compliance. EPA's compliance order for TVA includes developing a schedule for meeting all requirements. The Justice Department/EPA has cited facilities for violating NSR requirements and seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day. Defendants must comply with CAA requirements, remedy past NSR violations by installing BACT, apply for permits, and audit operations for compliance. TVA's compliance order includes developing a schedule for meeting all requirements affecting specified facilities. The TVA is asked to develop a schedule for meeting requirements affecting specified facilities, audit coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retire SO2 allowances for any reductions. The industry's response focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations. Industry argues that EPA has not objected to utilities engaging in these activities over the past 20 years, accusing EPA of changing the rules midway. Industry accuses EPA of changing rules midway by now citing activities as triggering NSR that were previously allowed for the past 20 years. The industry argues that these activities are necessary for plant operation and maintenance, similar to replacing worn tires on a car, and should not be considered violations of NSR. The industry argues that activities triggering NSR are necessary for plant operation and maintenance, akin to replacing worn tires on a car. Emissions must not exceed the cap, but if NSR is applied to sources under the cap, pollution will be shifted to other sources. The powerplants' emissions should not trigger major modifications under NSR. Emissions must not exceed the cap, but applying NSR to sources under the cap will shift pollution to other sources, leading to higher costs. The EPA Administrator claims controlling emissions could reduce SO2 by 1.87 million tons and NOx by 0.63 million tons. The EPA Administrator states that controlling emissions from power plants subject to NSR could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides pollutants, resulting in a reduction of 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. This would more than compensate for the erosion in original title IV reductions. At first glance, substantial emission reductions could be achieved by EPA's NSR action, with potential further reductions from utilities installing BACT or retiring offending facilities. The CAA is a complex legislation, but reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions could be significant. At first glance, substantial emission reductions could be achieved by EPA's NSR action. However, the CAA is complex, and reductions in SO2 would interact with reduction requirements under title IV. Specifically, title IV limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, with enforcement through tonnage limitations. In the case of SO2, reductions under NSR would interact with reduction requirements under title IV, which limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons starting in 2000, with interim reductions in 1995. Emissions are capped at individual plants based on historical data, not regulatory limits. Title IV of the program sets tonnage limitations on existing utility plants and requires an emission offset for new facilities. SO2 emissions are capped based on historical data, not regulatory limits. The program created an emissions allowance system where facilities are allocated allowances to emit SO2. Allowances can be used at the allocated plant. The 1990 CAA Amendments program under title IV established an emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions. Allowances are limited authorizations to emit SO2, allocated to existing facilities based on emission rate formulas. Allowances can be used at the allocated plant, traded, or banked for future use or sale. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The 1990 CAA Amendments program established an emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions, with allowances allocated to existing facilities. Allowances can be used at the plant, traded, or banked. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The NSR program focuses on modifications and BACT installation, while title IV compliance is based on the cap. The Title IV program focuses on reducing aggregate SO2 emissions by allowing utilities flexibility in compliance strategies. Compliance is determined by meeting the emissions cap, not by individual facility operations or BACT installation. The current SO2 NSPS sets a percentage reduction requirement for emissions, while title IV allocates allowances for existing facilities. The Title IV program aims to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions by giving utilities flexibility in compliance strategies. The current SO2 NSPS requires a 70%-90% reduction in emissions, while title IV allows for easier compliance with low-sulfur coal. Facilities installing BACT under NSR may \"overcontrol\" SO2 under title IV, leading to excess allowances for sale or banking. The allocations under title IV for existing coal-fired facilities are less strict and can be met with low-sulfur coal. Installing BACT under NSR may result in excess SO2 allowances under title IV, which can be sold or banked. Any reductions from NSR enforcement could be nullified if the plant sells its SO2 reduction to a facility not covered by NSR. There is no provision in title IV for adjusting allowance allocations due to NSR enforcement. The potential nullification of NSR enforcement by title IV could occur if a plant sells its SO2 reduction to a non-NSR covered facility. Title IV does not allow for adjustment of allowance allocations due to NSR enforcement, creating an \"allowance trap\" situation. Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to voluntarily surrender excess allowances from NSR actions to avoid this issue. The law on allowance allocations is based on historical data, not compliance with NSPS or SIP requirements. To avoid the \"allowance trap,\" Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to surrender excess allowances from NSR actions voluntarily. The interaction between NSR and NOx NSPS is complex, with the NOx NSPS historically lagging in technology development. The NOx NSPS historically lagged in technology development, with the standard set in 1979 at 0.6/0.5 lb. of NOx per million Btu for coal-fired facilities. This standard could be met with simple combustion modifications or low-NOx burners, not requiring pollution control devices like SCR. In 1998, a new standard reflecting the state of the art was set by the EPA. In 1998, EPA set a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, more aligned with available technology. However, this standard was challenged in court and vacated for modified utility boilers in September 1999. In 1998, EPA established a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, but it was challenged in court and vacated for modified utility boilers in September 1999. The NSPS for modified sources reverts to the 1979 standard until EPA proposes a revised NSPS, creating uncertainty for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The vacated modified standard for NSPS in 1998 creates uncertainty for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources, impacting NOx reduction programs under title IV. The 1998 NSPS modifications create uncertainty in determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources, affecting NOx reduction programs under title IV. The interaction of NSR and title IV exacerbates confusion, with the NOx program under title IV differing from the SO2 program in terms of emission rates. The title IV NOx program sets emission rates for existing facilities to be achieved by 1995 or 2000, regardless of modifications. The title IV NOx program differs from the SO2 program as it is based on emission rates, not tonnage limitations. Emission rates for existing facilities must be achieved by 1995 or 2000, with most boilers having a rate limitation of 0.45 to 0.5 lb. per million Btu, more stringent than the 1979 NOx NSPS. This results in some coal-fired facilities having stricter emission controls than the NSPS. The rate limitation for most boilers under title IV is 0.45 to 0.5 lb. per million Btu, more stringent than the 1979 NOx NSPS. Existing coal-fired facilities have emission controls since 1995 that are stricter than the NSPS. Surveying BACT determinations from 1991-1995 shows permitted emission rates ranged from 0.15 to 0.5 lb. per million Btu, making it difficult to project actual NOx reduction from EPA's NSR action. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, believing some sources are evading statutory rules. However, the actual NOx reduction from this action is uncertain due to varying permitted emission rates in the past. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions from sources that have been evading statutory rules. The outcome of this action is uncertain, as it may lead to costly litigation instead of actual emission reductions. The Clean Air Act's NSR approach is being questioned for its efficiency in controlling emissions. The Clean Air Act's NSR approach is being questioned for its efficiency in controlling emissions, with concerns about costly litigation consuming resources that could be better invested in other pollution controlling activities. More efficient methods, like title IV of the CAA enacted in 1990, have been developed to ensure declining emissions from existing sources over time. For example, title IV substantially reduces SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants. Title IV of the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1990, has been more effective in reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants compared to the NSR provisions added in 1977. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV has achieved 100% compliance, while NSR compliance has been questioned. The title IV program started without significant delays, unlike the NSR approach. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV of the Clean Air Act has been more successful in reducing emissions from utility plants compared to the NSR provisions. The program had 100% compliance and started without significant delays, in contrast to the NSR approach. One alternative suggested is to lower the cap on emissions from coal-fired power plants to further reduce SO2 emissions. EPA lawsuits against NSR could take years to resolve with uncertain outcomes. One alternative to address SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants is to lower the existing cap on emissions, which could achieve similar reductions as the 1990 SO2 cap. EPA lawsuits against NSR may take years to resolve with uncertain outcomes. Lowering the existing cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants could achieve similar reductions as the 1990 SO2 cap, with utilities having flexibility in meeting the requirements. Utilities may receive credit for shutdowns not allowed under NSR enforcement, but the administrative and cost advantages of the allowance system could be worth it. A new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx emissions could provide emission reductions similar to existing power plants meeting the 1978 NSPS. Utilities would have flexibility in achieving reductions and could receive credit for shutdowns not allowed under NSR enforcement. Implementing this program would require new legislation and could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives regarding NOx emissions. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade system. A new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx emissions could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives and require new legislation. EPA is urging states to consider implementing a regional cap and trade system for NOx emissions. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade program for NOx emissions as part of its proposed Federal Implementation Plan. This would require cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Another option is to focus on SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. The EPA is proposing a regional cap and trade program for NOx emissions, which would require cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Alternatively, focusing on SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives is also being considered. EPA has various regulatory initiatives in progress that aim to reduce SO2 and/or NOx emissions, including the OTR and Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. Several regulatory initiatives at EPA aim to reduce SO2 and/or NOx emissions, including the OTR and Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. These regulations have long implementation schedules with few reductions before 2010 and do not require further legislative authority. Another alternative to NSR would be to control other pollutants. The implementation schedules for regulatory initiatives to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions are long, with few reductions before 2010. Alternative options include tightening the title IV SO2 cap, creating an NOx cap, and controlling other pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide. Controls on these pollutants could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. Controls on pollutants from coal-fired power plants, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. Regulation of mercury emissions has been slow due to EPA determination requirements. Controversy surrounds EPA's authority to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. The regulation of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants has been slow due to EPA determination requirements. Controversy exists over EPA's authority to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. CO2 reductions may need to come from voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, or through reforming NSR. One proposed reform is to define \"modification\" based on plant age rather than physical or operational changes. In the midst of a legal battle over CO2 reductions, options for near-term reductions include voluntary initiatives, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, or reforming NSR. One proposed NSR reform suggests defining \"modification\" based on plant age, simplifying the trigger for older facilities. Another potential reform could stem from an EPA initiative aimed at addressing the current situation. One potential reform for NSR involves the \"Clean Unit Exclusion,\" which would exempt older facilities with state-of-the-art pollution control technology from complex NSR rules. EPA has been considering NSR reforms for years, with a focus on creating off-ramps from the regulations. The EPA has been considering reforms to NSR for years, including the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" proposal to exempt units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology from complex NSR rules. This proposal defines a \"clean unit\" as one with BACT or LAER installed within the last 10 years, allowing modifications that do not increase emissions. The EPA's proposal for the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" aims to exempt units with recent pollution control technology from NSR rules. However, the effectiveness of this proposal is debatable as it still requires legislative or regulatory finalization, which could be time-consuming and problematic. EPA already has the authority to enforce NSR regulations, but the outcome of any litigation remains uncertain. EPA is considering cap and trade programs as an alternative to NSR regulations. Replacing NSR with a cap could offer the same environmental protection at a lower cost. The focus of the debate on NSR has been on \"grandfathered\" powerplants. The outcome of the litigation is problematic as EPA is embracing cap and trade programs for pollutants, stating that NSR is duplicative and counterproductive. Replacing NSR with a cap offers the same environmental protection at a lower cost. The debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" powerplants, with examples of older coal-burning plants emitting significantly more pollution than newer plants due to exemptions in the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act of 1970 contains a loophole that allows older coal-burning power plants to emit significantly more pollution than newer plants. Industry lobbyists argued that these older plants would soon retire, but many are still operating without environmental controls. The Clean Air Act of 1970 loophole allows older coal-burning power plants to emit more pollution than newer plants. Industry lobbyists argued older plants would retire soon, but many are still operating without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is used in debates on emissions, indicating coverage under the Clean Air Act. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is often used in debates on emissions from existing powerplants, indicating coverage under the Clean Air Act. Passed in 1970, the Act requires the EPA to set regulations for new sources, including power plants, to install emission reduction systems. Section 111 of the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments mandates the EPA to establish New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new sources like power plants. These standards require major new sources to use the best emission reduction technology proven by the EPA. NSPS regulations currently cover sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter for power plants. \"Grandfathered\" refers to older coal-fired power plants not subject to these regulations. The NSPS regulations for power plants cover sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" refers to older coal-fired power plants not subject to these regulations, instead, they must meet emission rate limits established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP). The NSPS regulations for power plants cover SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" older coal-fired power plants are not subject to these regulations but must meet emission rate limits in a State Implementation Plan (SIP). Some pollutants like CO2 and Hg are not covered by NSPS for power plants, making the term \"grandfathered\" ambiguous or meaningless for these pollutants. The NSPS regulations cover SO2, NOx, and particulate matter for power plants. \"Grandfathered\" older coal-fired plants must meet emission rate limits in a State Implementation Plan (SIP). However, pollutants like CO2 and Hg are not covered by NSPS, making the term \"grandfathered\" ambiguous or meaningless for these pollutants. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years, increasing stringency as technology improves, leading to ambiguity in determining which power plants are \"grandfathered.\" The NSPS regulations cover SO2, NOx, and particulate matter for power plants, but pollutants like CO2 and Hg are not included, making the term \"grandfathered\" ambiguous. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years, increasing stringency as technology improves, leading to uncertainty in determining which power plants are \"grandfathered.\" The NSPS regulations for power plants are ambiguous with no set baseline. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx, sometimes stricter than NSPS requirements. Some \"grandfathered\" power plants had to meet more stringent NOx standards under phase 1 in 1995. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx, sometimes stricter than NSPS requirements. For example, some \"grandfathered\" power plants had to meet more stringent NOx standards under phase 1 in 1995, and coal-fired power plants had to meet equivalent or more stringent SO2 standards under phase 2 in 2000. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in these circumstances. Under phase 2 of title IV, existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired power plants must meet SO2 standards equivalent to or more stringent than the 1971 NSPS for SO2. The term \"grandfathered\" is irrelevant when discussing NOx emissions, as the focus should be on coal-fired facilities regardless of age. For SO2 emissions, the title IV emissions cap is the key consideration. If the focus of debate about \"grandfathered\" powerplants is NOx emissions, then age of plant is not relevant \u2013 fuel source is. Coal-fired facilities are the focus for increasing NOx controls. For SO2 emissions, the title IV emissions cap is the key consideration, with age being a factor in allocating emission credits. NSPS compliance is not the basis for defining \"grandfathered\" plants. New powerplants must comply with SO2 NSPS. The focus on reducing SO2 emissions from electric generating facilities suggests that shrinking the current cap on SO2 is the most logical approach. Similarly, implementing a cap on NOx emissions would be a logical extension to reduce NOx emissions. New powerplants must comply with SO2 NSPS, and all new sources must offset their emissions under the cap as they receive no allocation of emission credits. The NSPS for new powerplants requires them to offset their emissions under the cap as they receive no allocation of emission credits. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 and implementing a cap on NOx emissions are logical approaches to reducing pollution from electric generating facilities. EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast, sparking public debate and congressional oversight. The WEPCO decision and DOJ/EPA actions on NSR may also prompt further discussion on these issues. The EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address pollution from electric generating facilities. The WEPCO decision and DOJ/EPA actions on NSR may prompt further discussion on legislative intent and alternatives for addressing NSR issues. Many alternatives would require new legislation amending the Clean Air Act. Many issues are being raised regarding interpretations of legislative intent of CAA provisions, especially with modifications of existing sources. Addressing NSR issues may require new legislation to bring consistency and update the Clean Air Act's approach to regulating the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
