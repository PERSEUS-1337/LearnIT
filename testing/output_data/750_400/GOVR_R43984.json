However, they do not have complete control over their music, as cover versions can still be heard on streaming services like Spotify. Copyright holders, such as Taylor Swift and her record label, may not have total control over their music. For example, even if an artist like Ryan Adams covers Ms. Swift's album, he can still perform, reproduce, and distribute her musical works under certain conditions by paying her a royalty. This means that while Ms. Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings, she cannot dictate how her musical works are used as a songwriter who owns the rights to her music. Copyright law allows artists like Ryan Adams to perform, reproduce, and distribute Taylor Swift's musical works under certain conditions by paying her a royalty. While Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as a singer, she cannot control how the music service uses other versions of her works as a songwriter. The payment she receives for her works depends on market forces, contracts, and federal laws. Congress updated some copyright laws in the 1990s to address the emergence of music distribution on the internet, which changed how consumers accessed music. This update was necessary as laws were originally written when music was primarily accessed through radio broadcasts or physical media. The amount Taylor Swift gets paid for her musical works and sound recordings is determined by market forces, contracts, and federal laws governing copyright and competition policy. While Swift can control her own recorded music on platforms like Spotify, she cannot dictate how the service uses other versions of her works. With the emergence of music distribution on the internet, Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address unauthorized use of copyrighted content while protecting revenue sources in the music industry. Different copyright provisions were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts. The 1990s saw updates to copyright laws to combat unauthorized use of copyrighted content in the music industry. Different provisions were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. Music distribution has since evolved with the rise of streaming services, allowing consumers to stream songs on demand. The evolution of music distribution has blurred traditional lines of exploitation. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of the free Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing service. The Copyright Office has observed a blurring of traditional music exploitation lines. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion with the introduction of Napster. Apple launched iTunes Music Store in 2003, marking a shift towards digital downloads surpassing physical media sales in 2012. In 2012, the recording industry earned more from digital downloads than physical media, with Apple holding a 65% market share. However, sales from digital downloads started declining as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. Apple responded by launching its own subscription streaming music service. After peaking in 2012, digital music downloads sales declined as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. Apple responded by launching Apple Music in 2015 to compete in the subscription streaming music market. The rise of subscription music services has significantly changed music consumption patterns in the U.S. according to the RIAA. The launch of Apple Music in 2015 has transformed music consumption patterns in the US. Subscription music services now account for a significant portion of total industry retail spending, increasing from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017. Despite years of declining revenues, consumer spending on music remained flat in 2014-2015, grew 10% in 2015-2016, and 14% in 2016-2017. Consumer spending on music in the US shifted towards audio radio, cable services, and streaming music subscriptions, increasing from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017 out of a total of $8.5 billion. Despite years of declining revenues, spending on music remained flat in 2014-2015, grew 10% in 2015-2016, and 14% in 2016-2017. However, adjusted for inflation, annual spending on music is still significantly below its 1999 peak, impacting how creators and artists are compensated for their work. Consumer spending on music in the US shifted towards audio radio, cable services, and streaming music subscriptions, increasing from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017 out of a total of $8.5 billion. Despite years of declining revenues, spending on music remained flat in 2014-2015, grew 10% in 2015-2016, and 14% in 2016-2017. However, adjusted for inflation, annual spending on music is still nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak, impacting how creators and artists are compensated for their work through copyright law. Musical works and artists have legal rights that are typically licensed to third parties for exploitation. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including reproduction and distribution rights. The Copyright Act grants exclusive rights to owners of musical works, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work. In music publishing, the combination of reproduction and distribution rights is known as a \"mechanical right,\" dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for mechanical reproductions. The term \"mechanical right\" in music publishing dates back to the 1909 Copyright Act, where manufacturers paid for the right to reproduce musical compositions. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for reproductions, even as technology has evolved from piano rolls to digital copies. The term \"mechanical rights\" in music publishing originated from the 1909 Copyright Act, where manufacturers paid for the right to reproduce musical compositions. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, with works fixed before that date protected by state laws until February 15, 2067. The Copyright Act grants reproduction and distribution rights for recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Some music services have agreements to pay royalties for pre-1972 recordings. The Copyright Act grants reproduction and distribution rights for sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Examples of digital audio transmission services include webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. Public performance rights for sound recordings under federal copyright laws are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. The services mentioned include webcasting, digital subscription services like SiriusXM and Music Choice, and music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify. Public performance rights for sound recordings under federal copyright laws are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on compact discs privately, while record labels pay music publishers for recording rights. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on compact discs privately. Record labels pay music publishers for recording rights. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels for sound recordings. Radio listeners have less control over when and where they listen to music. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels for sound recordings. Radio listeners have less control over when and where they listen to music. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but it does require them to pay public performance royalties to music publishers and songwriters for notes and lyrics in broadcast music. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for notes and lyrics. Congress in 1995 decided that the promotional value of broadcast radio airplay outweighs any revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. In 1995, Congress concluded that the promotional value of broadcast radio airplay outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Both traditional broadcast radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners, known as \"ephemeral recordings\" under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Radio stations and music streaming services create temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners. These copies, known as \"ephemeral recordings,\" fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand by downloading digital files to their devices. Users of on-demand music streaming services can listen to songs by downloading digital files to their devices, known as conditional downloads. These services pay royalties to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute musical works. The music industry involves conditional downloads of digital files to consumers' devices. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute musical works and sound recordings. The industry comprises songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Some entities may fall into multiple categories. The music industry involves royalties paid to record labels/artists for reproducing and distributing sound recordings. It comprises songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs and license intellectual property for royalties. Some songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs, license intellectual property, and collect royalties. Publishers may provide advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Music publishers work with songwriters to collect royalties and provide advances in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Publishers monitor and generate revenue from music use in various formats, including sheet music, digital downloads, and broadcast radio. They often partner with performing rights organizations to license and collect payments for public use. The publisher's role is to monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music in formats requiring mechanical licensing rights. They may contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers share royalty income, with a standardized 50-50 division in contract terms for new songwriters entering the industry. Music publishers play a crucial role in monitoring, promoting, and generating revenue from music through mechanical licensing rights. They work with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Royalty income is shared between them, typically with a 50-50 division for new songwriters. Major publishers dominate the industry, with the top three firms accounting for over half of U.S. music publishing revenue. Music publishers, with a 50-50 income division between publisher and songwriter, fall into four categories: Major Publishers (Sony/ATV, Universal, Warner), Major Affiliates, Independent Publishers, and Songwriters. Multiple songwriters can complicate revenue division. Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group are the top three revenue earners in the music publishing industry. Independent publishing companies handle creative aspects of songwriting management and affiliate with major publishers for royalty administration. Independent publishers manage their own music catalogs, while some songwriters control their own publishing rights. Independent publishers administer their own music catalogs and are not affiliated with major publishers. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights and may hire individuals to handle royalties. Record labels are responsible for discovering talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Record labels are responsible for finding musical talent, recording their work, and promoting artists. The parent companies of major record labels reproduce and distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. Major labels have large distribution networks that traditionally moved physical recordings from manufacturing plants to retail outlets. The distribution role of record labels is evolving. The largest record labels, known as \"majors,\" distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. They have extensive distribution networks that are evolving to focus more on digital sales. Record labels handle functions like adding data for royalties and negotiating deals. The role of record labels is evolving with the decline in physical recordings. They now focus on selling digital copies, adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists can either contract with a label or retain their copyrights. Recording contracts typically involve transferring copyrights to the label. Recording artists negotiate with streaming services for rights to use sound recordings and monitor sales. They may contract with a record label or retain copyrights. Contracts require transferring copyrights to labels for defined periods and regions. Artists receive royalties from sales and licenses. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds, and guide artists' careers. Major stars earn royalties. Record labels require recording artists to transfer copyrights for defined periods and regions in exchange for royalties. They also finance recordings, provide advances, and offer career guidance. Major stars may negotiate full ownership of future sound recordings. The three major record labels, Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, dominate the industry's U.S. revenue. The three major record labels, Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, dominate the industry's U.S. revenue, earning about 65%. Each label shares a corporate parent with major music publishers. Smaller record labels specialize in genres like country or jazz. The major music publishers, Sony Corporation, Vivendi SA, and Access Industries, are associated with corporate parents. While smaller record labels focus on specific genres, they often rely on major labels for distribution. For example, Taylor Swift is signed to Big Machine Records, which has a distribution agreement with Universal Music Group. In genres like country or jazz, artists often depend on major record labels for distribution. Taylor Swift is signed to Big Machine Records, which has a deal with Universal Music Group. Chance the Rapper retains his copyrights and distributes his music independently, earning from tours and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights. Chance the Rapper retains his copyrights and distributes his music independently, earning from tours and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights for his album, Coloring Book, which became the first streaming-only album to rank among the top 10 U.S. albums. Chance the Rapper's album, Coloring Book, was the first streaming-only album to rank among the top 10 U.S. albums. A record producer is responsible for bringing the creative product into tangible form, involving creative and administrative tasks. In the past, record labels hired producers, but now artists enter into contracts with multiple producers for a single album. A record producer's role involves creative tasks like selecting songs and administrative tasks like booking studios. Artists now enter contracts with multiple producers for a single album, giving them control over compensation terms. Producers with negotiating power may demand royalties. Sound engineers run recording sessions under the producer's oversight, while mixers piece together polished finished products. The artist controls the producer's compensation terms instead of labels. Producers with negotiating power may demand royalties. Sound engineers run recording sessions under the producer's oversight, while mixers piece together finished products. Mixers may receive one-time payments per track or a portion of the artist's royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the copyright owner's exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of the copyright owner to make mechanical reproductions of music, allowing for audio-only reproduction through mechanical devices. Mixers may receive one-time payments per track or a portion of the artist's royalties, similar to producers in high demand. The 1909 Copyright Act allowed for mechanical reproductions of music through devices like player pianos and phonograph records. A mechanical license permitted the distribution of these copies for private use. Concerns were raised about a player-piano manufacturer, Aeolian Company, potentially creating a monopoly by acquiring exclusive rights from music publishers. The 1909 Copyright Act allowed for mechanical reproductions of music through devices like player pianos and phonograph records. Concerns were raised about Aeolian Company potentially creating a monopoly by acquiring exclusive rights from music publishers. Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to address this issue. Aeolian's player pianos were incompatible with competitors' piano rolls, leading consumers to buy Aeolian player pianos for popular music. To prevent a monopoly, Congress created the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allows others to use a sound recording or player-piano roll after it's distributed to the public, as seen in Ryan Adams' cover of Taylor Swift's album 1989 in 2015. In 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking her permission. Instead, they paid a compulsory mechanical license royalty rate set by the government. The 1909 Copyright Act established the rate at $0.02 per \"part manufactured,\" which remained unchanged for nearly 70 years. The 1909 Copyright Act set a royalty rate of $0.02 per \"part manufactured\" for mechanical licenses, which remained unchanged for almost 70 years. Technological advancements in the first half of the 20th century allowed record labels to increase the amount of music on each record side, leading to a shift in royalty rates to a \"per song\" basis. Congress revisited the mechanical license in the Copyright Act of 1976. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying that rates would be payable for each record made and distributed. Congress defined \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings, amending the law multiple times since then. The 1976 Copyright Act codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying rates for each distributed record. Congress defined \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings and established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses. The 1976 Copyright Act established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music, including serving a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office. Licensees must file the notice within 30 days of making a new recording. Licensees that cannot locate copyright owners must set aside money owed until owners can be located and paid. The 1976 Copyright Act made it easier for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and making potential licensees who fail to provide a notice of intention ineligible for a compulsory license. Failure to obtain a negotiated license constitutes infringement. The 1976 Copyright Act made it easier for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and making potential licensees who fail to provide a notice of intention ineligible for a compulsory license. Failure to obtain a negotiated license constitutes infringement under 17 U.S.C. Section 501 and is subject to remedies provided by Sections 502-506. Additionally, the Act removed the requirement for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" in the Copyright Office to recover against an unauthorized record manufacturer. Failure to identify itself to the Copyright Office precludes the holder from receiving certain benefits. The 1976 Copyright Act removed limitations on liability for copyright owners, making failure to obtain a negotiated license infringement under 17 U.S.C. Section 501. It also eliminated the need for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" in the Copyright Office to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. The Copyright Office only precludes the holder from receiving royalties under a compulsory license. There may be no public record of the copyright owner triggering the NOI requirements. Reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis. Controversy exists between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. In a 1982 article, Frederick F. Greenman Jr. and Alvin Deutsch discussed adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate. The Copyright Office's database of musical works has led to controversy between rights holders and licensees. In a 1982 article, Frederick F. Greenman Jr. and Alvin Deutsch discussed adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically. In 1967, a representative of the National Music Publishers Association suggested adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically. In 1975, Barbara Ringer proposed simplifying the administration of compulsory licenses by establishing a separate royalty tribunal. Congress created this tribunal in the 1976 Copyright Act. Establishing a separate royalty tribunal, appointed by the President, simplifies administering compulsory licenses alongside mechanical licenses. The tribunal, created by Congress in the 1976 Copyright Act, considers policy objectives such as maximizing public access to works and ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users. The 1976 Copyright Act established a royalty tribunal to determine rates for mechanical licenses, with policy objectives including maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions, and minimizing industry disruption. The tribunal was later replaced by an arbitration panel known as the Copyright Arbitration Royalty. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), established in 2004, sets licensing rates every five years for mechanical and certain other licenses. Composed of three judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress, the CRB aims to ensure fair income for copyright owners and users while minimizing industry disruption. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), established in 2004, sets licensing rates every five years for mechanical and certain other licenses. Composed of three judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress, the CRB acts as a ceiling for what an owner may charge, while also ensuring fair income for copyright owners and users. In 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA), amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works. The CRB-set rate acts as a ceiling for what an owner may charge, and users can negotiate voluntary licenses. In 1995, Congress passed the DPRA, amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover digital transmission of musical works. Rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries should distinguish between different types of transmissions. The Copyright Office proposed new rules in July 2008 regarding the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission, specifically focusing on distinguishing between different types of digital phonorecord deliveries. The Copyright Office proposed new rules in July 2008 to address the distinction between phonorecord delivery and digital phonorecord deliveries. This led to a debate on defining \"incidental DPD\" and the importance of resolving these issues for the music industry's survival in the 21st Century. The Copyright Office proposed new rules in July 2008 to address the distinction between phonorecord delivery and digital phonorecord deliveries, emphasizing the importance of resolving these issues for the music industry's survival in the 21st Century. In September 2008, a landmark agreement was reached regarding the applicability of mechanical licenses to music streaming, aiming to prevent a decline in revenues for music publishers as consumers shifted to on-demand streaming. The music industry, songwriters, and music streaming services reached a landmark agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming. Music publishers were concerned about declining revenues from mechanical royalties due to the shift to streaming. The agreement involved streaming services paying publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive, audio-only streaming services like Pandora were exempt from obtaining mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted a modified version of this agreement in 2009, valid until 2012. The CRB adopted a modified version of the agreement in 2009, extending it until 2012. In 2012, a new agreement was reached for mechanical royalty rates and standards for various music streaming services, which was subsequently adopted by the CRB. In 2012, a new agreement was reached for mechanical royalty rates and standards for music streaming services, covering rates from 2013 through 2017. In January 2018, the CRB issued its initial determination of royalty rates for the 2018-2022 period. Licensees pay a flat rate for physical phonorecord deliveries and permanent digital downloads. The CRB adopted the terms of the agreement for mechanical royalty rates from 2013 through 2017. In January 2018, they issued initial determination of rates for 2018-2022. Licensees pay a flat rate for physical phonorecord deliveries and permanent digital downloads, while interactive streaming rates are based on formulas considering the music service's revenues or total licensing costs. For interactive streaming, mechanical royalty rates are calculated based on formulas considering the music service's revenues or total licensing costs. The amount each publisher receives for a song is determined by another set of formulas, with minimum per-subscriber payments set for different categories of music services. Free trial periods may also impact royalty payments. The pool of money for mechanical royalty payments to publishers is determined by formulas based on music service revenues. Rates are set with minimum per-subscriber payments for different service categories. Free trial periods result in zero royalty rates. Rates are overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. In 1897, Congress granted songwriters the exclusive right to publicly perform their works, requiring establishments to obtain permission from songwriters and publishers. Public performance royalties are overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between parties. In 1897, Congress granted songwriters the exclusive right to publicly perform their works, requiring establishments to obtain permission from songwriters and publishers for public performances. This right allowed copyright owners to profit from their musical works, but the logistical challenge of licensing and collecting payment for public performances in various settings led to the need for a system to address this issue. To address the challenge of licensing and collecting payment for public performances, composers formed ASCAP in 1914. ASCAP is a performance rights organization that issues public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers. In 1914, composers formed the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), a performance rights organization that issues public performance licenses for musical works. Licensees can obtain a blanket license to perform any works in ASCAP's catalog for a fee. PROs collect public performance royalties and distribute them to publishers and songwriters. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. SESAC expanded its representation to include U.S. composers as broadcast radio grew more popular in the United States. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. To strengthen their bargaining power, broadcasters founded a competing PRO, SESAC, to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on advertising revenues. To strengthen their bargaining power, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. ASCAP and BMI originally acquired the. In 1939, broadcasters founded BMI to attract new composers and secure copyrights, convincing publishers to switch from ASCAP. ASCAP and BMI initially had exclusive negotiating rights for their members and offered blanket licenses for all songs in their catalogs. In 1940, a dispute between radio stations and ASCAP led to a policy prohibiting the broadcast of songs by ASCAP-affiliated composers. This conflict prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate. In December 1940, a dispute between ASCAP and radio stations led to a policy banning songs by ASCAP composers. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated for antitrust violations, leading to consent decrees by BMI and ASCAP in 1941. The decrees share similar features. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated ASCAP and BMI for antitrust violations in 1941. Both PROs entered consent decrees to avoid lawsuits, with similar requirements such as nonexclusive licensing rights and non-discriminatory terms for users. ASCAP and BMI share many features, including nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory terms for users, and accepting any songwriter or music publisher that meets certain standards. They must offer alternative licenses and allow federal district court judges to determine reasonable license fees. ASCAP and BMI must offer alternative licenses and allow federal district court judges to determine reasonable license fees for prospective licensees who cannot agree on royalty rates. SESAC and GMR, on the other hand, base their rates on different criteria. The public performance of musical works by ASCAP and BMI is overseen by federal district court judges, ensuring that the rates charged are \"reasonable.\" SESAC and GMR, on the other hand, negotiate rates based on marketplace dynamics. The Second Circuit Court emphasizes the need to consider the disproportionate power ASCAP and BMI hold in the industry. The federal district court must approve rates charged by ASCAP and BMI as \"reasonable\" due to their disproportionate market power. Current law prohibits consideration of rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. BMI exercise \"disproportionate power over the market for music rights.\" Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was included in the 1995 DPRA to address concerns about license fees affecting music performance. The 1995 DPRA included a provision to address concerns about license fees affecting music performance royalties for sound recordings transmitted by digital services. Congress aimed to dispel fears that these fees would impact music performance royalties. Billboard magazine described this concern as the \"pie theory.\" The concern among writers and publishers is that digital services paying a public performance licensing fee for sound recordings may reduce the money available for public performances of musical works. The DOJ periodically reviews the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, with the last amendments in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have been periodically reviewed by the DOJ, with the last amendments in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ's interpretation of the consent decrees in 2017. Congress enacted the 1971 Sound Recording Act to specifically apply copyright laws to sound recordings due to the prevalence of audiotapes and recorders in the 1960s. The Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ's interpretation of the consent decrees regarding copyright laws for sound recordings. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was enacted to address unauthorized duplications of sound recordings due to the prevalence of audiotapes in the 1960s. The 1971 Sound Recording Act aimed to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings by amending federal copyright laws. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that California's record piracy law applied to pre-1972 sound recordings. States also passed their own antipiracy laws, leading to a recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice to exclude pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. The U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. This was in response to California's record piracy law being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act addressed the issue of works potentially entering the public domain without this exclusion. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws that provided rights equivalent to copyright, but exempted pre-1972 works from federal protection. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt all state protection and these recordings will enter the public domain if not previously protected. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws that provided rights equivalent to copyright, exempting pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection and these recordings may enter the public domain. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to create temporary reproductions of sound recordings. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to create temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rules for these licenses are similar to those for incidental reproduction and distribution of musical works. Rates and terms for the Section 112 license are set by the CRB through SoundExchange. The rules for licenses governing temporary reproductions of sound recordings under Section 112 of the Copyright Act are similar to those for incidental reproduction and distribution of musical works. The rates and terms for these licenses are established by the CRB through SoundExchange, where copyright owners of sound recordings receive fees. Recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not receive Section 112 fees. Prior to the 1990s, record labels and recording artists did not have public performance rights for their sound recordings and primarily earned income from retail sales. Performance Royalties are received by copyright owners of sound recordings, usually record labels, through Section 112 fees. Recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not receive these royalties. The Copyright Act did not initially provide public performance rights to record labels and artists for their sound recordings. The recording industry faced challenges with music piracy with the rise of the internet in the 1990s, leading to amendments to the Copyright Act such as the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act in 1995. The recording industry primarily earned income from retail sales of physical products like CDs. Concerns over music piracy led to amendments to the Copyright Act in the 1990s, including the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998. The DPRA granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services, and created a compulsory license for copyright owners to license. The DPRA in 1995 and the DMCA in 1998 addressed concerns over music piracy by granting record labels and artists exclusive public performance rights for sound recordings. The DPRA also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for certain digital audio services. The DPRA in 1995 created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for certain subscription services. Music publishers and writers were concerned about record companies withholding licenses, compromising between trade groups representing music publishers and record labels. The DPRA in 1995 created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for certain subscription services, compromising between trade groups representing music publishers and record labels. The provision led to debates between the Recording Industry Association of America and nonsubscription streaming services on public performance royalties. After reaching a compromise, Congress adopted the DMCA, which expanded on these issues. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, were included in this system. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, were subject to one standard, while webcasters and other noninteractive music streaming services entering the market after that date are subject to different rates and terms. Noninteractive music streaming services established before July 31, 1998, are subject to the Section 801(b)(1) standard, while those entering the market after that date are subject to rates and terms reflecting marketplace negotiations. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruptive impacts on industry structure. The Section 801(b)(1) standard for rate-setting in noninteractive music streaming services aims to represent negotiated marketplace rates and minimize disruptive impacts on industry structure. This standard led to lower copyright royalty rates in one case, but its overall effect is hard to predict. According to a 2010 report from the Government Accountability Office, the Section 801(b)(1) rate-setting standard aims to prevent disruption of existing operations in services prior to July 31, 1998. The DPRA allows owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. The DPRA, enacted in 1998, allows owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. The term \"interactive service\" refers to services enabling individuals to arrange specific recording transmissions. The Senate Judiciary Committee expressed concerns in 1995 about certain subscription and interactive audio services potentially impacting sound recording sales and copyright owners' control over their work. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 expressed concerns about certain subscription and interactive audio services potentially impacting sound recording sales and copyright owners' control over their work. Interactive services are seen as the most likely to affect traditional record sales and pose a threat to those dependent on revenue from record sales. Congress does not mandate broadcast radio stations to obtain public performance licenses from owners. Interactive services are the most likely to impact traditional record sales, posing a threat to those dependent on revenue from record sales. Congress does not require broadcast radio stations to obtain public performance licenses from owners of sound recordings. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 aimed to strike a balance among various interested parties regarding the benefits of airplay and promotional activities for sound recordings and performers. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 aimed to strike a balance among various interested parties regarding the benefits of airplay and promotional activities for sound recordings and performers, emphasizing the mutually beneficial relationship between broadcast radio and the music industry. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 emphasized the mutually beneficial relationship between broadcast radio and the music industry. The legislation should not jeopardize this relationship, as free over-the-air broadcasts provide entertainment, non-entertainment programming, and public interest activities to local communities. The CRB sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users and holders. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates for broadcast radio, ensuring a mix of entertainment and non-entertainment programming for local communities. Participants in rate determination proceedings include copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Negotiations occur over a three-month period, with written statements and discovery if no agreement is reached. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates for broadcast radio, involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups in negotiations. Parties have a three-month period for voluntary negotiations, followed by written statements and discovery if no agreement is reached. Proposed rates are submitted to the CRB for review and potential adoption. During the rate-setting proceeding, participants may reach agreements on statutory rates and submit them to the CRB for review. If no agreement is reached, the CRB holds an evidentiary hearing and issues a determination in the Federal Register. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) can adopt proposed rates or decline them, holding evidentiary hearings if no agreement is reached. Participants can request rehearings or appeal CRB determinations to the U.S. Court of Appeals. SoundExchange was established by RIAA in 2000 as a common agent for record labels. In 2003, RIAA spun off SoundExchange as an independent entity responsible for distributing royalties to record labels after deducting costs. The CRB adopts \"per-performance\" rates for public sound recording performances based on the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. Participants can challenge CRB decisions through appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals. SoundExchange, spun off by RIAA in 2003, distributes royalties to record labels after deducting costs. CRB sets \"per-performance\" rates for online music services based on the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. Percentage-of-revenue rates are adopted for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services. The CRB sets \"per-performance\" rates for online music services, while percentage-of-revenue rates are adopted for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services. Congress has passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates. The CRB sets \"per-performance\" rates for online music services, but Congress has passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates. The agreements enabled music streaming services to pay royalties based on a percentage of their revenue instead of a \"per-performance\" rate, with the most recent agreements expiring in December 2015. The CRB allowed music streaming services to pay royalties based on revenue percentage instead of \"per-performance\" rates. Agreements expired in December 2015, leading to a rate-setting proceeding for 2016-2020. Questions arose about interpreting the provision barring consideration of negotiated agreements. The CRB rate proceeding for music streaming services from 2016-2020 raised questions about the exclusion of negotiated agreements in setting royalties. Pandora Media, Inc., Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia, Inc.), and SoundExchange disagreed on whether direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement could be used as evidence. SoundExchange argued that Congress intended to prevent these agreements from being used against settling parties. The CRB rate proceeding for music streaming services from 2016-2020 involved a dispute between Pandora Media, Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia, Inc.), and SoundExchange over the use of direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement as evidence. SoundExchange argued that Congress intended to prevent these agreements from being used against settling parties. The CRB rate proceeding for music streaming services from 2016-2020 involved a dispute between Pandora Media, Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia, Inc.), and SoundExchange over the use of direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement as evidence. SoundExchange argued that Congress intended to prevent these agreements from being used against settling parties in subsequent proceedings. The CRB referred novel material questions of substantive law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution, who ruled that the CRB may consider directly negotiated licenses that reflect provisions in a Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. The CRB rate proceeding for music streaming services from 2016-2020 involved a dispute over the use of direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement as evidence. The CRB referred novel material questions of substantive law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution. In December 2015, the CRB issued its decision on rates for 2016-2020, setting a rate of $0.17 per 100 streams on nonsubscription services. The CRB issued a decision on rates for music streaming services from 2016-2020, setting a rate of $0.17 per 100 streams on nonsubscription services. Annual rate increases from 2017-2020 are tied to the Consumer Price Index, and ephemeral royalties fees are set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties. The CRB tied annual rate increases from 2017-2020 to the Consumer Price Index and included ephemeral recording fees with Section 114 royalties. Ephemeral royalties fees were set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties for the 2016-2020 period. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for 2018-2022, with public performance rates varying based on music service type and rate-setting standards specified by the Copyright Act. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for the 2018-2022 period. Public performance rates vary based on music service type and rate-setting standards specified by the Copyright Act. Royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed as follows: 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured recording artist, 2.5% to an agent for nonfeatured musicians, and 2.5% to an agent for nonfeatured vocalists. Record producers are not included in the distribution. The Copyright Act specifies the distribution of royalties collected under Section 114: 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured recording artist, 2.5% to an agent for nonfeatured musicians, and 2.5% to an agent for nonfeatured vocalists. Record producers are not included in this distribution for public performances by noninteractive digital services. Producers can be compensated through SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The Copyright Act specifies royalty distribution for public performances of sound recordings, excluding record producers. Producers can be compensated through SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is debated. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services in defining the process for setting rates for public performance rights has been a matter of debate. Interactive services allow the public to receive specially created programs or specific sound recordings upon request. (For information on proposed legislation regarding producer compensation, refer to \"Bills Introduced in the 115th Congress.\") Section 114 of the U.S. Copyright Act defines an interactive service as one that allows the public to receive specially created programs or specific sound recordings upon request. This distinction is not considered in Section 115, which addresses mechanical rights for digital services. The U.S. Copyright Act does not distinguish between interactive and noninteractive services for obtaining mechanical rights from music publishers. In a 2009 ruling, a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre was deemed noninteractive. The CRB has adopted distinctions for setting rates for mechanical licenses. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not considered interactive. This decision aimed to protect sound recording copyright holders from sales cannibalization. The court's decision on interactive services aimed to protect sound recording copyright holders from cannibalization of record sales by analyzing user control and predictability in music selection. The court's decision focused on the concern that interactive services could impact record sales by offering predictability in music selection, even though unique playlists were created for each user. The court determined that LAUNCHcast's unique playlists did not guarantee predictability, classifying it as a noninteractive service eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Noninteractive services must limit features to qualify for licensing. LAUNCHcast was classified as a noninteractive service eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Noninteractive services must limit features to qualify for licensing, such as not announcing in advance when specific songs will be played. The Launch Media decision affirmed this for personalized music streaming services like Pandora. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses as noninteractive services for their public performances of sound recordings. The CRB-established rates do not currently differentiate between customized services and other services that transmit radio-style programming over the internet. Spotify's services, however, offer more flexibility. Streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can get statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The rates set by the CRB do not distinguish between personalized services and others that transmit radio-style programming. Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists. Users can access songs for free with ads or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening. Spotify allows users to access specific albums, songs, and artists on demand. Users can listen for free with ads or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening on both personal computers and mobile devices. Congress provided antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners of sound recordings to negotiate collectively with SiriusXM and subscription services over royalties. In 1995, Congress provided antitrust exemptions for copyright owners of sound recordings to negotiate collectively with SiriusXM and subscription services over royalties. The exemption is only available if common agents designated are nonexclusive, preserving the ability to negotiate directly with copyright owners. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. Copyright owners and entities can still negotiate directly with copyright owners for sound recordings. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. Copyright owners and entities can use common agents for a clearinghouse function, not rate-setting. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to address ephemeral server reproductions and provided an antitrust exemption for negotiations between copyright owners and licensees through designated common agents. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to address ephemeral server reproductions and provided an antitrust exemption for negotiations between copyright owners and licensees through designated common agents, allowing them to negotiate, pay, and receive royalty payments for ephemeral recordings. Unlike Section 114(e)(1), Section 112(e)(2) does not specify that the designation must be on a nonexclusive basis. Section 112(e)(2) allows copyright owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating and receiving royalty payments for ephemeral recordings. Unlike Section 114(e)(1), this section does not require the designation to be nonexclusive. The House Judiciary Committee report attributes this omission to aligning with existing antitrust exemptions in copyright law. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 with provisions stating that licensees must make payments to designated entities other than the Copyright Office. The CRB, established in 2004, allows for the designation of entities to receive royalties, following existing antitrust exemptions in copyright law. Congress specified that a government entity could designate an agent to receive royalties for the first time. The Copyright Royalty Judges designated an entity to receive royalties for the first time, allowing parties to make payments while appealing royalty decisions until final rates are established. The House Judiciary Committee report highlighted a provision allowing parties to continue making royalty payments while appealing decisions by the Copyright Royalty Judges, until final rates are established. SoundExchange was designated as the sole \"collective\" by the CRB in 2006. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" on an interim basis. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a \"designated agent\" to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are already designated agents under the Copyright Act, so formal recognition of Royalty Logic was unnecessary for its involvement in royalty distribution. The CRB argued that Royalty Logic does not need formal recognition as a designated agent to be involved in royalty distribution, citing Sections 112(e) and 114(e) of the Copyright Act. They also stated that Royalty Logic's argument for promoting competition on pricing does not apply to statutory licenses. The CRB found that selecting a single collective is the most efficient way to collect royalties under statutory licenses, based on the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with this decision in 2009. The CRB determined that choosing a single collective is the most efficient method for collecting royalties under statutory licenses, supported by the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. This decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. The CRB's decision upheld the authority to designate a single entity to receive royalty payments under statutory licenses, as supported by the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. The court upheld the CRB's authority to designate a single entity, SoundExchange, to receive royalty payments under statutory licenses. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single collective. SoundExchange was chosen for the period 2011-2014 as the most economically and administratively efficient option. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for the period 2011-2014, citing economic and administrative efficiency. In 2015, agreements were reached with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, approved by the CRB. In 2015, SoundExchange reached agreements with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, approved by the CRB. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting royalties for the period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting, monitoring, and distributing sound recording royalties for the rate period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. Congress also created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses for DPDs. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting sound recording royalties. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating mechanical licenses. Music publishers collect royalties through third-party administrators in the US. In the US, music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, who distribute the royalties to publishers and then to songwriters. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in September 2015. The Harry Fox Agency is a major third-party administrator that distributes mechanical royalties to publishers, who then pass them on to songwriters. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in September 2015. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association trade organization. Music publishers issue and administer mechanical licenses themselves. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. Royalty Logic raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and collecting mechanical royalties. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and collecting mechanical royalties. Noncash considerations may influence the price interactive services pay for music access, such as major labels acquiring an 18% equity stake in Spotify. Noncash considerations, such as major labels acquiring equity in Spotify, may impact the price interactive services pay for music access. Sony shared proceeds from selling its stake with artists and independent labels. Sony sold a portion of its stake in Spotify when the company went public in 2018, and announced plans to share proceeds with artists and independent labels. Rates paid by interactive music services to music publishers are linked to those paid to record labels for performance rights. Sony distributes music and has ties to rates paid by interactive music services to both record labels and music publishers. This allows music publishers to participate in deals involving equity stakes or advertising revenues when negotiating for mechanical royalties. Copyright law prohibits rates for public performances from being linked to rates for other rights. Music publishers can participate in deals with digital music services for mechanical royalties, assigning value to items like equity stakes or advertising revenues. Concerns have been raised about fair sharing of payments between publishers and record labels from these services, potentially leading to lower payments. ASCAP and BMI, representing 90% of songs in the US, are concerned about fair payments from digital music services. SESAC and Global Music Rights also play a role in performance rights licensing. Music publishers may affiliate with multiple PROs, while songwriters can only choose one. Publishers have raised concerns about receiving a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to alleged limitations imposed by ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. SESAC and Global Music Rights also play a role in performance rights licensing. Beginning in 2011, music publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to withdraw digital rights from blanket licenses to negotiate directly with digital services. ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to grant music publishers the right to license their songs. In 2011, publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to negotiate directly with digital services by withdrawing their digital rights from blanket licenses. ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to grant music publishers the right to license their public performance rights for new media uses, enabling them to negotiate market prices with digital streaming services. Pandora Media, Inc. challenged the publishers' partial withdrawal of rights. Pandora Media, Inc. challenged music publishers' partial withdrawal of rights for new media uses, arguing that publishers must either have their entire song catalog \"all in\" or \"all out\" of the PRO, according to court rulings in the Southern District of New York. The courts ruled that music publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights from PROs, requiring their song catalog to be either fully included or excluded. Major publishers and PROs requested DOJ to modify consent decrees to allow partial rights grants, expedited arbitration for rate-setting, and flexibility for ASCAP and BMI. The major music publishers and PROs requested modifications to consent decrees, seeking partial rights grants, expedited arbitration, and bundled licenses. DOJ announced a review in June 2014, soliciting comments on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing.\" The DOJ announced in June 2014 that it would evaluate the consent decrees, including the issue of \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing.\" Fractional licensing is the industry practice where each writer's publisher licenses only a portion of a song. If the consent decrees required 100% licensing, any writer or rights holder could issue a performance license without the consent of other rights holders. The DOJ completed its review in August 2016 and announced that the consent decrees required PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs. DOJ argued that this promotes competition and called on Congress to reconsider how copyright law is applied to music. On August 4, 2016, the DOJ completed its review and announced that the consent decrees required PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs. DOJ argued that this promotes competition and called on Congress to reconsider how copyright law is applied to the music industry. Additionally, DOJ suggested that a more comprehensive legislative solution may be preferable. The DOJ completed its review on the consent decrees in August 2016, requiring PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs. They suggested a more comprehensive legislative solution for copyright law in the music industry. BMI filed a lawsuit in response, leading to a ruling by Judge Stanton allowing fractional licensing under BMI's consent decree. In September 2017, Judge Stanton ruled that BMI's consent decree allows fractional licensing, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in December 2017. A Notice of Intention (NOI) must be served to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords, along with applicable royalties. If the copyright owner's address is not known, filing the NOI with the Copyright Office suffices. The Copyright Office announced new procedures in April 2016 for licensees to file Notices of Intention (NOIs) to reproduce and distribute musical works under Section 115 in bulk electronic form, reducing filing costs significantly. In 2016, the Copyright Office introduced new procedures for licensees to file Notices of Intention (NOIs) in bulk electronic form, reducing filing costs from $2 per song to $0.10 per song. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the procedural change. The Copyright Office reduced filing costs for Notices of Intention (NOIs) from $2 per song to $0.10 per song, with an upfront fee of $75. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google started filing NOIs in bulk after the procedural change. Digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office in 2015 to argue for digitizing the compulsory licensing process. In late 2015, digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office to advocate for digitizing the compulsory licensing process. This move aimed to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. Lawsuits were filed against Spotify and other online music services for illegally streaming copyrighted works, with some cases settled and others pending as of April 2018. The Music Modernization Act, passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018, aims to create a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. Several lawsuits were filed against Spotify and other online music services for illegally streaming copyrighted works, with some cases settled and others pending. The House of Representatives passed the Music Modernization Act in April 2018 with a vote of 415-0. The bill creates a nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer blanket mechanical licenses. It also changes the process for suing for infringement and setting royalty rates for music services like Music Choice, Muzak, and SiriusXM. The Music Modernization Act passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018 aims to create a nonprofit mechanical licensing collective funded by online music services. This collective would offer blanket mechanical licenses and change the process for suing for infringement and setting royalty rates for music services like Music Choice, Muzak, and SiriusXM. Additionally, the bill extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 and establishes procedures for producers, mixers, and sound engineers to receive royalties. The Music Modernization Act passed by the House of Representatives aims to create a nonprofit mechanical licensing collective funded by online music services. This collective would offer blanket mechanical licenses and change the process for setting royalty rates for music services like Music Choice, Muzak, and SiriusXM. The bill would extend federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 and establish procedures for producers, mixers, and sound engineers to receive royalties. Online music services could pay for a broad blanket mechanical license under the bill. The Music Modernization Act allows for royalty payments to producers, mixers, and sound engineers for sound recordings. Online music services can pay for a blanket mechanical license through a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC). The Register of Copyrights would designate the MLC and a digital licensee coordinator every five years. The Music Modernization Act establishes a Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) and a digital licensee coordinator. The MLC will have a 17-member board of directors and will be funded by online music services through an assessment set by the CRB. The MLC's duties include maintaining a musical works database. The MLC, under the Music Modernization Act, will have a 17-member board of directors funded by online music services through a CRB-established assessment. Its duties include maintaining a musical works database, administering blanket licenses, identifying musical works, locating copyright owners, and facilitating ownership claims. The MLC, authorized under the Music Modernization Act, will maintain a musical works database, administer blanket licenses, identify and locate copyright owners, facilitate ownership claims, and collect/distribute royalties from online music services to rights holders. The MLC, established under the Music Modernization Act, is responsible for managing musical works ownership, administering licenses, collecting and distributing royalties from online music services, and ensuring songwriters receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC is prohibited from negotiating royalty rates or granting licenses for public performances of musical works. The Music Licensing Coordinator (MLC) is responsible for managing musical works ownership, administering licenses, and distributing royalties. They are prohibited from negotiating royalty rates, granting licenses for public performances, or engaging in government lobbying activities. The digital licensing coordinator's duties include establishing governance structure, membership criteria, and enforcing payment obligations. The digital licensing coordinator's duties include establishing a governance structure, membership criteria, enforcing payment obligations, setting administrative assessment rates, participating in proceedings before the CRB and Copyright Office, and maintaining records of activities. They are prohibited from engaging in government lobbying activities. The digital licensing collective is responsible for establishing governance structure, membership criteria, enforcing payment obligations, setting administrative assessment rates, participating in proceedings before the CRB and Copyright Office, and maintaining records of activities. They are prohibited from engaging in government lobbying activities. Failure to provide monthly reports or royalties may result in default of the blanket license, with the option to seek review in federal district court if the collective improperly terminates the license. Claims can be brought to federal district court for unresolved issues. An online music service could seek review in federal district court if the digital licensing collective improperly terminated a blanket license. Copyright owners would be prohibited from suing a music service with a valid blanket license for infringing reproduction and distribution rights. Copyright owners of musical works would be prohibited from suing an online music service that complies with a valid blanket license. Lawsuits filed after January 1, 2018, against online music services for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of musical works prior to the blanket license availability date can be reviewed in federal district court. If a musical works copyright owner filed a lawsuit after January 1, 2018, against an online music service for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of a musical work before the blanket license availability date, they could only recover royalties under the new system, not damages or other remedies, provided the service complied with specified requirements like good faith. After January 1, 2018, if a musical works copyright owner sued an online music service for unauthorized use before the blanket license availability date, they could only recover royalties under the new system, not damages or other remedies, as long as the service complied with specified requirements like good faith efforts to locate the copyright owner. The CRB would set royalty rates using the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. The CRB would be required to use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard in setting royalty rates for the reproduction and distribution of musical works and public performances of sound recordings by certain subscription services and satellite digital audio services. Judges in the Southern District of New York would set rates for public performances of musical works by online services and digital subscription services. Judges in the Southern District of New York may consider rates for public performances of sound recordings by subscription services and satellite digital audio services. This does not apply to broadcast radio stations. The current system of assigning judges in the Southern District of New York to oversee cases related to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees would change. Instead of permanently assigned judges, a random process would determine which judge hears rate setting cases for public performances of sound recordings by subscription services and satellite digital audio services. This does not apply to broadcast radio stations. The Southern District of New York is considering changing the system of assigning judges for ASCAP and BMI cases. Instead of permanently assigned judges, a random process would determine which judge hears rate setting cases. Original judges overseeing consent decrees would not be allowed to oversee rate proceedings. This change is based on the belief that rate decisions should be assigned randomly to judges. The House Judiciary Committee report suggests that judges overseeing consent decrees should not be allowed to oversee rate proceedings for ASCAP and BMI cases in the Southern District of New York. This change aims to ensure that rate decisions are assigned randomly to judges. Sound recording creators from specific time periods may be entitled to payments from digital music services for publicly performing their recordings. Creators of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, but after January 1, 1923, could receive payments from digital music services for public performances. This entitlement under federal law would be in addition to any state copyright protections for these recordings. To receive statutory damages or attorney's fees, rights owners must file specific information with the Copyright Office. Rights owners of pre-1972 sound recordings can receive payments for public performances under federal law, in addition to state copyright protections. To be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees, owners must submit required information to the Copyright Office, including sound recording identification and licensee contact details. Regulations for filing this information must be issued by the Copyright Office within specific timeframes. The Copyright Office must issue regulations for filing sound recording identification and licensee contact information. Federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings would be in place until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings allows producers, mixers, and sound engineers to seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist until February 15, 2067. The entity in charge of distributions must be a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB, as per the modified 17 U.S.C. \u00a7114(g). The CRB allows for a nonprofit collective to handle royalty distributions for pre-1972 sound recordings. The collective must adopt a policy for distributions and can be designated by copyright owners and performers. Legislators have introduced additional measures related to music. In 2007, the CRB stated that a collective does not need formal recognition to be involved in royalty distribution. Copyright owners and performers can designate collectives for royalties. Legislators introduced resolutions in 2017 to support the Local Radio Freedom Act, opposing new fees or charges for sound recordings. In January 2017, Senator John Barrasso and Representative Michael Conaway introduced resolutions supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act, opposing new fees for sound recordings on radio stations. In April 2017, Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, giving copyright owners exclusive rights to sound recordings. The PROMOTE Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Issa, grants copyright owners the exclusive right to withdraw their music from broadcast radio stations for public performance of sound recordings. This bill aims to give more control to copyright owners over their music on radio stations. The PROMOTE Act of 2017 grants copyright owners the exclusive right to withdraw their music from broadcast radio stations for public performance. Broadcast radio stations may play sound recordings without permission under certain conditions. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350 in July 2017. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, which aims to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. The bill also includes restrictions on remedies for copyright owners who do not provide required information in the database. The bill introduced by Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, H.R. 3350, aims to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. It also includes restrictions on remedies for copyright owners who do not provide required information in the database. Additionally, Representative Hakeem Jeffries introduced the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, which would establish a Copyright Claims Board as an alternative forum for copyright owners to protect their work from infringement. The Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, proposes a Copyright Claims Board for civil copyright cases capped at $30,000 in damages.
