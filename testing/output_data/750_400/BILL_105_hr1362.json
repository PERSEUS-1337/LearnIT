The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facility selection in a demonstration project. The selection of facilities will be done in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a plan for selecting facilities within designated geographic service areas to participate in the project. The selection plan will prioritize facilities suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals due to high potential demand. The selection plan for facilities in designated geographic service areas will prioritize those suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals due to high potential demand and capability in billing and accounting.

Payments under this section will be made on a periodic basis consistent with the periodicity of payments under the Medicare program. The Secretaries will establish rules for computing payment amounts, made periodically from Medicare trust funds. Payments will be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. There will be an annual limit on Medicare payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will determine payments from Medicare trust funds for a demonstration project with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The annual limit for the demonstration project with the Department of Veterans Affairs is $50,000,000. Payment amounts may be reduced if the VA fails to maintain effort to prevent shifting costs to the Medicare program. The annual limit for the project may be reduced based on actual VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans compared to the maintenance of effort level. Maintenance of effort level is determined based on the preceding fiscal year. The maintenance of effort level for any fiscal year is the amount equal to the maintenance of effort level for the preceding fiscal year or the amount of VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans for fiscal year 1997, adjusted by the same percentage change. The maintenance of effort level for a fiscal year is adjusted based on the percentage change in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the preceding fiscal year. The maintenance of effort level for a fiscal year is adjusted based on the percentage change in the VA medical care appropriation compared to the previous fiscal year, and is also influenced by any decrease in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans.

The plan developed under Public Law 104-204 defines VA medical expenditures for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans as the amount spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a fiscal year for hospital care and medical services under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. The Department of Veterans Affairs spent an amount in a fiscal year for hospital care and medical services for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans, excluding certain expenditures. The Department of Veterans Affairs monitors expenditures under the Medicare program for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans to ensure no increase in costs compared to what would have been spent without the demonstration project. The Comptroller General closely monitors expenditures under the Medicare program for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans during the demonstration project to compare with what would have been spent without the project. The Comptroller General audits these expenditures annually and reports to the Secretaries.
