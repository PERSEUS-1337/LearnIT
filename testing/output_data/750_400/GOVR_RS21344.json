This process has helped former dictatorships and communist states become stable democracies and market economies. The EU keeps the door open for any European country, like Turkey and the Western Balkans, that meets its political and economic criteria. The EU's enlargement policy has been a powerful tool in transforming former dictatorships and communist states into stable democracies and market economies.

The EU's enlargement policy has transformed former dictatorships and communist states into stable democracies and market economies.

The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established in 1952 by six states to create a single market in coal and steel industries. This was a key stage in the process of European integration aimed at promoting peace, stability, and economic growth in Europe after World War II. In 1952, six states established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) to create a single market in coal and steel industries.

In 1957, the six ECSC member states signed two new treaties in Rome: the first established the European Economic Community (EEC) to develop common economic policies and merge national markets into a single market; the second created a European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for peaceful nuclear energy use. These treaties, known as the \"Treaties of Rome,\" came into force in 1958.
