    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that Type 2 diabetes affects 17 million Americans, with over 1 million new cases diagnosed annually, costing the nation an estimated $138 billion per year. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common complication of diabetes, leads to visual degradation and blindness, affecting individuals aged 20 to 74. Up to 24,000 diabetics become legally blind each year. Most diabetes patients will develop diabetic retinopathy, increasing the risk of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 74, with up to 24,000 diabetics becoming legally blind each year. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes, and the prevalence is expected to rise due to the onset of type 2 diabetes at younger ages. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is expected to increase due to the onset of type 2 diabetes at younger ages. Clinical trials show that early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%, with remote assessment offering potential for reaching diabetic patients in underserved areas. Medicare coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy is being added under Section 1861 of the Social Security Act. This allows for early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy, which can reduce vision loss by 90%, especially beneficial for reaching underserved diabetic patients. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' is a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes. It must meet technical standards set by the Secretary and be conducted via a telecommunications system by a physician or practitioner. The remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy must meet technical standards determined by the Secretary in consultation with industry and practitioner groups. It is conducted via a telecommunications system by a qualified physician, practitioner, or non-physician technician to eligible patients enrolled in the program. The text chunk discusses the provision of remote healthcare services to eligible patients by qualified physicians, practitioners, or non-physician technicians, despite not being physically present with the patient. Payment for these services is allowed, bypassing limitations on store and forward technology as outlined in the Social Security Act. The text chunk allows for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies, despite the provider not being physically present with the patient. The text allows for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies, enabling asynchronous transmission of health information in various formats. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide interim payment for these assessments until a final regulation is published. During the interim period after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make payments for retinopathy assessments and assign temporary HCPCS codes. A study on reimbursement for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy will be conducted within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the costs of providing remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report on the study will be submitted to Congress within two years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the costs of providing remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report with recommendations on reimbursements under the Medicare program and the need for repeating the study will be submitted to Congress within two years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted regarding reimbursements for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy under Medicare and whether the study should be repeated. The amendments will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the Act's enactment. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will now cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act specifying the effective date and state compliance requirements. The Act specifies state compliance requirements for Medicaid coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The State plan is not considered non-compliant with Medicaid requirements solely for not meeting an additional requirement before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session following the enactment of the Act. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is seen as a separate regular session of the State legislature. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to provide grants to 5 eligible entities for setting up mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants can only be used for projects related to designing, demonstrating, and implementing such programs. The Secretary will provide grants up to $1,000,000 for eligible entities to establish mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Applications must be submitted within 90 days of funding availability. The Secretary may provide grants up to $1,000,000 for eligible entities to establish mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Applications must be submitted within 90 days of funding availability. The Secretary will publish a notice for grant applications under this section, specifying required information. Eligible entities must submit applications to the Secretary, with priority given to those with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment. The Secretary may require grant applications to prioritize experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment and serving rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. The Secretary may require grant applications to prioritize experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment and serving rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. Congressional notification is necessary before making a grant under this section, and an evaluation and report must be conducted within 3 years of the first grant. The Secretary must notify Congress at least 3 days before granting funds under this section. An advisory committee will evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program within 3 years of the first grant. The Secretary will convene an advisory committee to evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in increasing early detection and decreasing prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy. The advisory committee will assess the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in early detection and prevention of diabetic retinopathy, as well as its potential as a model for similar screening programs for other chronic conditions. A report is due within 42 months. The advisory committee will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in detecting complications related to diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. A report must be submitted to Congress within 42 months. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 42 months, containing the results of the advisory committee's evaluation. Definitions include an advisory committee and eligible entities like hospitals or educational institutions. The term 'eligible entity' refers to hospitals, educational institutions, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, or community health centers receiving assistance under section 330. The term 'mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program' refers to a program that offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy to patients primarily residing in rural, underserved, and remote areas. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy to patients residing in rural, underserved, and remote areas. It is a mobile program established under this section. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this program. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program, a mobile program established under this section, is authorized to receive $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 for its operations."
