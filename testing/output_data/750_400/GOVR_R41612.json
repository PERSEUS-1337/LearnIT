    "content": "The United States has been a major provider of global food aid for over 55 years, with a historical focus on agricultural development. However, funding for this assistance has decreased from 20% of U.S. official development assistance in 1980 to around 5% in 2007. Critics argue that this decline has reduced the U.S.'s capacity to provide agricultural assistance. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority in his inaugural address. In 2009, global hunger reached a historic high due to the food price crisis and economic recession. The Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger initiative called Feed the Future. In response to the global hunger crisis caused by the 2007-2008 price crisis and economic recession, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Feed the Future initiative in 2009. This initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and enhance food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. Some view this as a crucial moment in U.S. foreign assistance history, particularly in agriculture development and food security reform. The Feed the Future initiative aims to promote global agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. Some argue that reform of American food aid and foreign assistance is necessary, with a focus on innovative approaches to address these issues. Some argue that reform of American food aid and foreign assistance is necessary, with a focus on innovative approaches to achieve global food security objectives through increased local buy-in and engagement from the private sector. Interagency reviews have examined strategies and coordination in development and foreign assistance policies and programs. The interagency review processes of development and foreign assistance policies and programs have focused on strategies, programs, and coordination to achieve global food security objectives. These events will be relevant to Congress as it discusses the U.S. global food security initiative. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs administered by various U.S. agencies and international organizations. The interagency review processes focus on strategies, programs, and coordination for global food security. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs administered by U.S. agencies and international organizations. Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative. The U.S. government, including agencies like USAID, State Department, and USDA, along with multilateral organizations like the World Bank, are involved in food security initiatives. Congress influences funding through appropriations and may consider legislation to support agricultural development, research, and food security safety nets. Legislation introduced in previous sessions aimed to increase support in these areas. The 111th Congress introduced legislation to support agricultural development, research, and food security safety nets. Uncertainty exists regarding potential increases in U.S. foreign assistance funding due to changes in House leadership and the federal budget deficit. The 111th Congress introduced legislation to support agricultural development, research, and food security safety nets. Uncertainty exists regarding potential increases in U.S. foreign assistance funding due to changes in House leadership and the federal budget deficit. A bill to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance was introduced in the last Congress, relevant to the U.S. global food security initiative. The prospects for consideration of funding increases are uncertain. The report aims to provide context on global food insecurity, overview the Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, and highlight issues for the 112th Congress on agricultural development and global food security. The report aims to provide context on global food insecurity, overview the Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, and highlight issues for the 112th Congress on agricultural development and global food security. The number of food-insecure people worldwide reached historic levels in 2009, with more than 1 billion undernourished according to the FAO. The global food insecurity crisis in 2009 saw over 1 billion people undernourished, with the number expected to decrease to 925 million in 2010. The proportion of hungry people in the world increased in 2008 and 2009 due to global food and economic crises. The estimated number of people suffering from chronic hunger in 2010 is 925 million, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The number of undernourished people had been slowly increasing for the past decade before the recent crises. The decline in the number of chronically hungry people in the world in the 1980s and early 1990s was attributed to increased investment in agriculture following the global food crisis of the early 1970s. The number of undernourished people globally had been increasing steadily for the past decade, with a decline in hunger in the 1980s and early 1990s attributed to increased investment in agriculture. However, between 1995-2006, hunger increased in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean due to a decline in official development assistance for agriculture. The gains in hunger reduction were later reversed in this region as well, following food and economic crises. The number of hungry people globally increased between 1995-2006 due to a decline in official development assistance for agriculture. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in the proportion of undernourished people. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in the proportion of undernourished people, impacting progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The proportion of hungry people rose in 2008, slowing progress towards reducing hunger and poverty. The majority of undernourished individuals are in developing countries, with millions suffering in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Near East, North Africa, and even in developed countries. The 2010 hunger report by FAO estimated that 578 million people in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries suffer from chronic undernourishment. Global hunger decreased by 9.6% from 2009 to 2010, with the most significant reduction in Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa saw a smaller decrease of about 12 million people. In 2010, global hunger decreased by 9.6%, with Asia seeing the most significant reduction of 80 million fewer people going hungry. Sub-Saharan Africa had a smaller drop of about 12 million people, still having the highest rates of food insecurity. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index also showed improvement from 1990 to 2010. Africa has the highest rates of food insecurity in the world, with one out of three people undernourished. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index showed improvements in various regions, with significant progress in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) showed significant improvements in various regions from 1990 to 2010. The GHI scores decreased by 14% in sub-Saharan Africa, 25% in South Asia, and 33% in the Near East and North Africa. Southeast Asia and Latin America saw the greatest progress, with scores decreasing by 40% or more. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest regional GHI scores, but South Asia made more progress since 1990. The Global Health Index (GHI) scores decreased significantly in various regions from 1990 to 2010, with the Caribbean showing the greatest improvement of over 40%. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest GHI scores, with South Asia making more progress. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with South Asia attributing it to low women's status and sub-Saharan Africa to government effectiveness, conflict, and health issues like HIV/AIDS. According to IFPRI, the causes of hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa differ. In South Asia, low women's status contributes to underweight children, while in sub-Saharan Africa, factors include low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV/AIDS. Most countries with high GHI scores are in these regions, where progress in reducing hunger has been slower compared to Latin America. High child mortality and inability to meet calorie requirements are influenced by factors like instability and high rates of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. IFPRI reports that progress in reducing the Global Hunger Index (GHI) has been slower in these regions compared to Latin America. Few countries have achieved significant reductions in their GHI scores, with one-third making modest progress and another third showing minimal improvement. Among the nine countries where GHI scores increased, all are in regions facing challenges like low government effectiveness and conflict. Few countries reduced their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores by 50% or more over the past decades, with one-third making modest progress and another third showing minimal improvement. Among the nine countries where GHI scores increased, all are in sub-Saharan Africa, except for North Korea. Conflict and political instability have worsened hunger in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. Swaziland's high prevalence of HIV/AIDS has also contributed to its GHI increase. The Global Hunger Index rose in nine countries, all in sub-Saharan Africa except North Korea. Conflict and political instability have increased hunger in The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. In Swaziland, HIV/AIDS and high inequality have undermined food security. The Gambia saw an increase in undernourishment due to lower social protection spending. Zimbabwe's economic collapse has led to more underweight children. The high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, along with high inequality, has severely impacted food security despite higher national incomes. In The Gambia, undernourishment increased due to lower social protection spending. In Zimbabwe, economic collapse has led to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries, like Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam, have shown significant improvements in their Global Hunger Index scores. Ghana was the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve noteworthy progress. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) noted that some countries, including Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam, made significant improvements in their scores. Ghana was the top performer in sub-Saharan Africa. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years to address global hunger during the G8 Summit in Italy. Ghana was the top performer in sub-Saharan Africa in improving their GHI score since 1990. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in Italy to address global hunger and promote agricultural development. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched to mobilize at least $20 billion over three years to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit leaders and other countries announced the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security to combat hunger and poverty by mobilizing $20 billion over three years. They committed to five principles for a food security initiative. The G8 summit leaders announced a Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security, committing at least $20 billion over three years. They also agreed to five principles for the initiative, focusing on sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth, along with social protection mechanisms for the most vulnerable. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to promote sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth, along with social protection mechanisms for the most vulnerable. They also committed to reversing the trend of decreasing official development assistance funding. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes in line with the Accra Agenda for Action. The L'Aquila declaration aims to provide official development assistance (ODA) funding for agriculture in line with the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA), which emphasizes country-led coordination processes for implementing agricultural strategies and plans. Developing and donor countries, along with multilateral and bilateral development institutions, have committed to reforming the way development aid is given and spent through the AAA. The AAA was agreed upon by developing and donor countries, along with multilateral and bilateral development institutions. Developing countries committed to country-led strategies, donors pledged better coordination, and both parties agreed to be accountable. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 endorsed the CAADP to target resources to country priorities. The G8 endorsed the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) in sub-Saharan Africa to target resources to country priorities. CAADP, part of the African Union, focuses on improving food security, nutrition, and increasing incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. The CAADP program, established in 2003 as part of the African Union, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. The program is aligned with the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. The L'Aqulia declaration calls for allocating 10% of national budgets to agriculture annually. It aligns with the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis, focusing on immediate and long-term actions to address rising food prices. The CFA proposed actions to address global food price rises, focusing on immediate needs of vulnerable populations and longer-term food security. Immediate actions include enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For longer-term security, the CFA called for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, and improving international food market accessibility.

For longer-term food security, they called for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries. Countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged $2 billion to support the Global Partnership, totaling $22 billion, although these commitments have not been fully realized yet. At the G20 Summit in 2009, countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged an additional $2 billion to support the Global Partnership for agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries, bringing the total commitment to $22 billion. The United States also collaborated with private philanthropists and the private sector to coordinate food security efforts. In November 2009, FAO organized a World Summit on Food Security in Rome, where 60 heads of state and government endorsed the Global Partnership. In November 2009, FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state and government endorsing the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported that agricultural output would need to increase by 70% over current levels. The Global Partnership was endorsed at the World Summit on Food Security in Rome, with a commitment to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported that agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a population expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document in 2009. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document in 2009, outlining priorities and strategies for addressing global food security. In 2010, the initiative was officially launched as \"Feed the Future\" (FtF), with a new guiding strategy document and implementation plans. The Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document outlined priorities and strategy for the Administration's food security initiative. In May 2010, the initiative was officially launched as \"Feed the Future\" (FtF), with new guiding strategy and implementation documents developed through a consultative process with various stakeholders. The FtF strategy guide and implementation documents were developed through a consultative process with global stakeholders, including other countries, international institutions, foundations, civil society organizations, the private sector, and farmers. The initiative builds on five principles for sustainable food security and mentions three cross-cutting priorities: gender, environment, and climate change. FtF has two key objectives according to the U.S. State Department strategy guide. The FtF initiative, based on principles for sustainable food security, focuses on gender, environment, and climate change. It aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries through interventions like improving agricultural productivity and expanding markets. The Feed the Future initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries by focusing on interventions that improve agricultural productivity and expand markets for agricultural commodities. It also works to develop policies, services, and infrastructure to help smallholder farmers manage risk and adapt to dynamic environments. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production levels. The Feed the Future initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth by improving agricultural productivity, expanding markets, and developing policies and infrastructure to help smallholder farmers manage risk. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production levels and income of farmers in rural areas. The initiative is driven by country-owned plans, with activities and investments varying by country based on key priorities.

The criteria for selecting these countries include chronic hunger and poverty, potential for agricultural-led growth, regional synergies, host government commitment, and resource availability. FtF investments will be in two phases based on country investment plans. Phase 1 countries are preparing their country investment plans with assistance in capacity-building, technical support, stakeholder consultations, and identifying necessary actions. Phase 1 countries are in the process of developing their country investment plans (CIPs) with assistance in capacity-building, technical support, stakeholder consultations, and identifying necessary actions. Phase 2 countries have completed their CIPs, which include priority areas, clear costing, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, technical feasibility, and implementation plans. Phase 2 countries should have completed a CIP that outlines priority areas, clear costing, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, technical feasibility, and implementation plans. Additionally, they must commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural development and improved nutrition. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for the Feed the Future (FtF) program includes $1.64 billion, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. FtF aims to partner with countries to develop and implement Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) roundtable process.

Discussions during the 111th Congress focused on reforming U.S. foreign aid to address modern national security challenges and development needs. During the 111th Congress, there was a push to reform U.S. foreign aid to better address national security challenges and development needs. Criticisms included inefficiency and lack of alignment with national security interests. The Obama Administration made efforts to address these issues and potential reforms. The Obama Administration attempted to address criticisms of U.S. aid programs by launching the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review in 2009. This review aimed to create a more coordinated and effective approach to U.S. development policy. The State Department launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power\" in 2010. The QDDR, led by the Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources, was released by Secretary Clinton in 2010 as \"Leading Through Civilian Power.\" It aims to elevate American civilian power to advance national interests and be a better partner to the military, outlining foreign policy and development objectives, strategies, and resource management. The QDDR, released in 2010, aims to elevate American civilian power to advance national interests and be a better partner to the military. It developed a statement of U.S. foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies, tools, resources, and management reforms. Additionally, the Administration launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009 for a government-wide review of global development policy. The Administration also launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009 to review the roles and effectiveness of U.S. government agencies involved in global development. Led by the President's National Security Advisor and the Chairman of the National Economic Policy Council, the PSD aims to make U.S. development policy more effective. The PSD review is examining the roles and advantages of U.S. government agencies in global development. Key NSC staff are involved in the process. A draft of PSD-7 prioritizes economic growth and democracy in U.S. development policy. The National Security Council (NSC) staff are key players in the PSD review, focusing on development, democracy, and regional issues. A draft of PSD-7 emphasizes economic growth and democratic governance as priorities in U.S. foreign policy, creating a new government structure to elevate development. This approach has generated enthusiasm in the development community, with the Administration stating that the QDDR will complement the PSD efforts. The PSD-7 process, focusing on economic growth and democratic governance, aims to create a new government structure prioritizing development in U.S. foreign policy. The QDDR will assess how its recommendations align with broader government approaches. The completion of PSD-7 has been significantly delayed. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD by assessing how its recommendations fit into broader government approaches and the Administration's foreign policy framework. The completion of PSD-7 has been significantly delayed, with uncertainty about whether final outputs will be made public. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, emphasizing the importance of development, diplomacy, and defense working together. The completion of PSD-7 has been delayed, with uncertainty about public release. President Obama's new Presidential Policy Directive emphasizes development, diplomacy, and defense working together for national security. Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health are highlighted in the directive. Global Food Security is a key development initiative highlighted in the President's Policy Directive, along with Climate Change and Global Health. The directive emphasizes the coordination of interagency efforts to implement the directive, starting with the FY2012 budget process. In November 2010, the USAID Administrator announced the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to lead food security efforts and implement President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. The USAID Administrator announced the creation of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to lead food security efforts and implement President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. BFS will coordinate interagency efforts with the State Department, Millennium Challenge Corporation, USDA, and expand partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress may face issues regarding agricultural development, global food security, and food aid. The creation of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) will lead food security efforts and implement President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. BFS will coordinate interagency efforts and expand partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress may face issues regarding agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform, including the pledge of $3.5 billion over three years to support the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. At the G8 Summit in L'Aquila in 2009, President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years to support global agriculture and food security. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative, with a proposed funding bill of $52.81 billion. The House and Senate are considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House bill proposed $52.81 billion, $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request. The Senate also approved a funding bill for State-Foreign Operations. The House bill proposed $52.81 billion for FY2011 appropriations, $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request.

The Senate bill for FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding allocated $54.22 billion, $1.40 billion less than the House subcommittee draft and $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. Funding for the federal government was enacted through continuing resolutions, with the most recent one continuing funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. The FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding bill allocated $54.22 billion, less than the House subcommittee draft and below the Administration's request. Funding for the federal government was enacted through continuing resolutions, with the most recent one continuing funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. The current fiscal situation and congressional leadership shift may lead to further debate on food security and agricultural development funding. The Administration's FY2012 request is due in mid-February. The Administration's FY2012 request for funding related to food security and agricultural development is due in mid-February. There is skepticism in the international community about the G8 pledge of $22 billion over three years for the Global Partnership. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund has received $914 million in pledges, but actual resources received from donors are lower. Skepticism exists in the international community regarding the G8's $22 billion commitment to the Global Partnership. Despite pledges of $914 million to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund, only $263 million has been received from donors. Concerns have been raised about the G8 falling short of previous aid commitments. Many foreign policy and development experts are concerned about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for global development. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing key officials, leaving several key posts at USAID unfilled. Many critics have expressed concern over the lack of strong leadership at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for global development. The Obama Administration faced criticism for significant delays in appointing key officials, leaving key posts at USAID unfilled. This leadership vacuum has allowed other federal agencies like the State Department, Department of Defense, and U.S. Department of Agriculture to take on a larger role in development activities typically overseen by USAID. Critics have raised concerns about unfilled posts at USAID, leading to a \"leadership vacuum\" that has allowed other federal agencies to take on development activities typically overseen by USAID. This divided approach has been questioned for potentially undermining USAID's authority and resources. Some critics question the divided development approach among federal agencies, expressing concerns about the decline in staff capacity at USAID. Senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, have highlighted the absence of USAID in significant foreign policy challenges. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the severe decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades, particularly in addressing challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Secretary Gates emphasized the imbalance between military and civilian elements in the national security apparatus, attributing it to a lack of capacity rather than willingness. In an article published in Foreign Affairs in January/February 2009, Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalanced growth of the United States' national security apparatus, attributing it to a lack of capacity rather than willingness. This imbalance stems from the consequences of the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced or neglected. The State Department froze hiring new Foreign Service officers, and USAID's staff capacity dropped significantly. Security capabilities are still dealing with the aftermath of the 1990s when key U.S. power instruments abroad were reduced. The State Department froze hiring new Foreign Service officers, and USAID's staff capacity significantly declined. USAID's staff has significantly decreased from 15,000 during the Vietnam War to less than 3,000 today. In 2008, the agency had only 2 engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. These staff cuts have led to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness and the closure of overseas missions, impacting the agency's technical expertise. In 2008, USAID had only two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. Staff cuts have led to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness, closure of overseas missions, and a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs. This has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. Staff cuts at USAID have led to a loss of technical expertise and a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs. This has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. Additionally, USAID faces challenges in managing its agricultural development portfolio due to shortages of staff with expertise in agriculture and related technical areas. Since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative, USAID has been addressing the fragmentation in its agricultural development assistance by hiring more agriculture foreign-service officers. The U.S. government collaborated with land-grant universities in the 1950s and 1960s to establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. Since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative, USAID has hired nearly 40 additional agriculture foreign-service officers to address rebuilding its technical capacity. In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government collaborated with land-grant universities to establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. The Title XII \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment formalized the universities' role in international development efforts in 1975. Capacity building has been a strategic direction at USAID since the 1990s. Since the 1990s, USAID's role in capacity building in developing countries has declined, with a significant decrease in post-graduate training support. Agricultural research funding and duration have also been reduced over the last decade. USAID's support for capacity building in developing countries, including post-graduate training and agricultural research, has significantly declined over the past decade. This reduction has weakened partner institutions' institutional capacity, despite USAID recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. USAID's support for capacity building in developing countries has declined, impacting partner institutions' institutional capacity. Despite recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness, USAID has not restored funding for training and capacity-building programs, especially in agriculture. Questions remain about the sufficiency of institutional capacity. Some concerns exist about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural programs. Sub-Saharan Africa lacks a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture, and governments and donors have been hesitant to invest in this area. There is sufficient institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, especially Africa, to implement agricultural research, education, training, and market development programs. Some concerns exist about the weak scientific foundation for modern agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, with governments and donors hesitant to invest in science and technology for increasing agricultural productivity. Several U.S. agencies, including USAID, the State Department, and USDA, are involved in formulating policy and implementing agricultural development and food security assistance.

Bills in the 111th Congress aim to enhance the U.S. role in addressing global hunger. The Feed the Future initiative under the new food security program lacks clear coordination with other U.S. government entities and funding implications. Bills in the 111th Congress highlight the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies recognized the need for coordination to make international aid more effective. The United States collaborates with other donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union to harmonize strategies and activities. It is uncertain if these issues will be a priority in the 112th Congress. The United States collaborates with partner countries and international bodies to harmonize strategies and activities for more effective international aid.

The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes country-led planning for program sustainability, which some Members of Congress have concerns about due to potential lack of donor control and oversight in aligning with specific objectives. Developing countries may also face challenges in developing robust strategic plans and carrying out accountability measures. Some Members of Congress are concerned about country-led planning diminishing donor control and oversight, as it may not align with donor-specific objectives. Developing countries may lack capacity for strategic planning and accountability measures required by donors.

Key questions include how food aid will be coordinated with Feed the Future activities and if it will reinforce FtF objectives. The FtF strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change, but it is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans. The FtF strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. It is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans and strategies for implementation, and how FtF will be coordinated with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and the Global Climate Change Initiative. The Administration has been developing the FtF results framework, key indicators, and metrics to track progress towards the initiative's goals. It is unclear which agency and specific individuals will be responsible for coordinating FtF with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and GCCI.
