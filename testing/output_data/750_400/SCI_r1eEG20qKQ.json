Regularization hyperparameters for neural networks can be adapted by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function. Scalable best-response approximations for neural networks can be constructed by modeling the best-response as a single network with gated hidden units. This approximation is justified by showing that the exact best-response for a shallow linear network with L2-regularized Jacobian can be represented by a similar gating mechanism. We construct scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the best-response as a single network with gated hidden units, justified by the exact best-response for a shallow linear network with L2-regularized Jacobian.

Bilevel optimization involves solving two sub-problems, the upper-level and lower-level problems, where the upper-level problem must be solved subject to optimality of the lower-level problem. Minimax problems are an example of bilevel programs where the upper-level objective equals the negative lower-level objective. Bilevel optimization involves two sub-problems: the upper-level and lower-level problems. Minimax problems are an example where the upper-level objective equals the negative lower-level objective. Bilevel programs were first studied in economics for leader/follower dynamics and have applications in various fields, including machine learning for hyperparameter optimization, GAN training, meta-learning, and neural architecture search. In economics, bilevel programs model leader/follower dynamics and have applications in machine learning for hyperparameter optimization, GAN training, meta-learning, and neural architecture search. Bilevel problems are NP-hard even with linear objectives and constraints, leading to a focus on obtaining local solutions in nonconvex settings. In contrast to previous work focusing on restricted settings, this study aims to find local solutions in nonconvex, differentiable, and unconstrained scenarios. The objective is to design a gradient-based algorithm for solving the optimization problem with upper-and lower-level objectives and parameters. The study aims to find local solutions in nonconvex, differentiable, and unconstrained scenarios by designing a gradient-based algorithm for optimization problems with upper-and lower-level objectives and parameters. The simplest method, simultaneous gradient descent, updates \u03bb using \u2202F /\u2202\u03bb and w using \u2202f /\u2202w, but often gives incorrect solutions due to neglecting the dependence of w on \u03bb. The study proposes a gradient-based algorithm for solving Problem 4, emphasizing the importance of using gradient information for faster optimization. Simultaneous gradient descent updates \u03bb and w but may lead to incorrect solutions. A more principled approach involves using the best-response function to convert Problem 4. The study proposes a gradient-based algorithm for solving Problem 4 by using the best-response function to convert it into a single-level problem. This method requires a unique optimum w * (\u03bb) for each \u03bb and differentiability of w * for gradient descent optimization. The best-response function w* converts Problem 4 into a single-level problem, allowing for gradient descent optimization on F* with respect to \u03bb. Sufficient conditions for unique optima w*(\u03bb) and differentiability of w* are provided in a neighborhood of a point (\u03bb0, w0) where w0 solves Problem 4b for \u03bb0. Sufficient conditions for unique optima w*(\u03bb) and differentiability of w* are provided in a neighborhood of a point (\u03bb0, w0) where w0 solves Problem 4b for \u03bb0. The gradient of F* decomposes into direct and response gradients, with the direct gradient capturing the direct reliance of the upper-level objective on \u03bb. The gradient of F* decomposes into direct and response gradients, stabilizing optimization by converting the bilevel problem into a single-level one. The response gradient stabilizes optimization by converting the bilevel problem into a single-level one, ensuring a conservative gradient vector field. Unique solutions and differentiability of w* can lead to effective algorithms in practice. Metz et al. (2016) proposed a method for GAN optimization by converting the problem into a single-level one to avoid issues described by Mescheder et al. (2017). Assuming uniqueness of a solution and differentiability of w* can lead to efficient algorithms. Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization methods aim to approximate the best-response w* or its Jacobian, but they can be computationally expensive and struggle with discrete and stochastic hyperparameters. Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization methods aim to approximate the best-response w* or its Jacobian, but struggle with discrete and stochastic hyperparameters. Lorraine & Duvenaud (2018) proposed promising approaches to directly approximate w* using a differentiable function \u0175 \u03c6 with parameters \u03c6. Lorraine & Duvenaud (2018) proposed methods to approximate w* using a differentiable function \u0175 \u03c6 with parameters \u03c6, which can serve as a proxy for w* in hyperparameter optimization. The proposed method by Lorraine & Duvenaud (2018) uses a differentiable function \u0175 \u03c6 with parameters \u03c6 to approximate w* in hyperparameter optimization. The algorithm locally approximates w* in a neighborhood around the current upper-level parameter \u03bb. The algorithm by Lorraine & Duvenaud (2018) uses a flexible function to approximate w* in hyperparameter optimization. They locally approximate w* around the upper-level parameter \u03bb using a Gaussian noise distribution. An alternating gradient descent scheme updates parameters \u03c6 and \u03bb to minimize specific equations. The algorithm by Lorraine & Duvenaud (2018) approximates w* around \u03bb using Gaussian noise with a fixed scale parameter \u03c3. An alternating gradient descent scheme updates \u03c6 and \u03bb to minimize specific equations, showing promise on problems with L2 regularization on MNIST. However, its applicability to different regularizers or larger problems, handling high-dimensional w, setting \u03c3, and adaptability remain unclear. The approach by Lorraine & Duvenaud (2018) approximates w* around \u03bb using Gaussian noise with a fixed scale parameter \u03c3. It is unclear if this approach works with different regularizers or scales to larger problems, and handling high-dimensional w remains a challenge. In this section, a best-response approximation \u0175 \u03c6 is constructed for memory efficiency and scalability to large neural networks. Automatic adjustment of the neighborhood scale \u03c6 is described to address these challenges.

The best-response architecture for Self-Tuning Networks operates on pre-activations, adding a correction for hyperparameters. It enables parallelism and improves sample efficiency during training by perturbing hyperparameters independently for different examples in a batch. This approximation can be easily implemented in deep learning libraries by replacing modules with \"hyper\" counterparts. The best-response function in Self-Tuning Networks can be represented compactly by using a linear network with Jacobian norm regularization. The hidden units in the network are modulated based on the hyperparameters, allowing for a more efficient training process. In this section, a model is presented where the best-response function is represented using a linear network with Jacobian norm regularization. The network's hidden units are modulated based on hyperparameters, improving training efficiency. The model uses a 2-layer linear network to predict targets from inputs, with a squared-error loss regularized with an L2 penalty on the Jacobian. In this section, a 2-layer linear network with weights is used to predict targets from inputs. The model employs a squared-error loss with an L2 penalty on the Jacobian. The network's hidden units are modulated based on hyperparameters for improved training efficiency. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of a regular network with weights w 0 = (Q 0 , s 0 ) and sigmoidal gating of hidden units to approximate the best-response for deep, nonlinear networks. This architecture simplifies the sigmoidal gating from the preceding section for small approximations of the best-response function. The architecture shown in FIG0 uses sigmoidal gating of hidden units to approximate the best-response for deep, nonlinear networks. For a narrow hyperparameter distribution, a smooth best-response function can be approximated by linear gating, replacing the sigmoidal gating to ensure weights are affine in the hyperparameters. The best-response function can be approximated by linear gating for a narrow hyperparameter distribution, ensuring weights are affine in the hyperparameters. This approach yields the correct best-response Jacobian for quadratic lower-level objectives, leading to convergence to a local optimum in gradient descent on the approximate objective. Using an affine approximation to the best-response function for quadratic lower-level objectives ensures gradient descent on the approximate objective converges to a local optimum. The effect of the sampled neighborhood is crucial, as a small neighborhood may only match the exact best-response at the current hyperparameter without guaranteeing matching gradients. The effect of the sampled neighborhood is crucial in using an affine approximation to the best-response function for quadratic lower-level objectives. A small neighborhood may only match the exact best-response at the current hyperparameter without guaranteeing matching gradients. The Gaussian distribution of DISPLAYFORM0 with mean 0 and variance DISPLAYFORM1 controls the scale of the hyperparameter distribution on which \u03c6. The sampled neighborhood size is important for approximating the best-response function. The scale of the hyperparameter distribution controlled by \u03c3 affects the flexibility of the approximation. Entries of \u03c3 must balance flexibility and capturing local shapes. Adjusting \u03c3 during training based on the sensitivity of the upper-level objective to the sampled hyperparameters is proposed to balance flexibility and capture local shapes. An entropy term weighted by \u03c4 \u2208 R + enlarges the entries of \u03c3 in the objective. To address the changing smoothness of the loss landscape during training, adjusting \u03c3 based on the sensitivity of the upper-level objective to sampled hyperparameters is proposed. An entropy term weighted by \u03c4 \u2208 R + enlarges the entries of \u03c3 in the objective, leading to an objective similar to variational inference with \u03c4 = 1, interpolating between variational optimization and variational inference. The objective function in the current chunk is similar to variational inference, with \u03c4 ranging from 0 to 1 to interpolate between variational optimization and variational inference. Minimizing the first term moves probability mass towards an optimum \u03bb*, balancing \u03c3 to avoid heavy shrinkage. The current chunk discusses the training algorithm for better representation learning and tuning hyperparameters using stochastic operations like batch normalization or dropout. It emphasizes balancing the optimization process to avoid heavy entropy penalties. The current chunk describes the STN training algorithm for tuning hyperparameters that other gradient-based algorithms cannot handle, such as discrete or stochastic hyperparameters. It involves an unconstrained parametrization of hyperparameters and a non-differentiable discretization for discrete hyperparameters. The STN training algorithm involves an unconstrained parametrization of hyperparameters and a non-differentiable discretization for discrete hyperparameters. It uses gradient descent to update parameters and alternates between training and validation losses. The STN training algorithm involves an unconstrained parametrization of hyperparameters and a non-differentiable discretization for discrete hyperparameters. It uses gradient descent to update parameters and alternates between training and validation losses. STNs are trained by a gradient descent scheme which alternates between updating \u03c6 for T train steps to minimize f (\u03bb, w) and updating \u03bb and \u03c3 for T valid steps to minimize DISPLAYFORM0. The possible non-differentiability of r due to discrete hyperparameters poses no problem. The algorithm for training STNs involves updating parameters \u03c6 for T train steps to minimize f(\u03bb, w) and updating \u03bb and \u03c3 for T valid steps to minimize DISPLAYFORM0. The reparametrization trick is used to estimate derivatives without involving the discretization of r. The derivative of E \u223cp( |\u03c3) [f (\u03bb + ,\u0175 \u03c6 (\u03bb + ))] with respect to \u03c6 can be computed using the reparametrization trick. Two cases are considered for the gradient computation with respect to a discrete hyperparameter \u03bb i. Case 1 involves regularization schemes where L V and F do not directly depend on \u03bb i, while Case 2 deals with scenarios where L V explicitly relies on \u03bb i. The reparametrization gradient can be used for regularization schemes where F does not depend on hyperparameter \u03bb i directly. For cases where L V relies on \u03bb i, the REINFORCE gradient estimator can be used. This approach is necessary for hyperparameters like the number of hidden units in a layer that directly impact the validation loss. The method was applied to convolutional networks and LSTMs. Estimator BID15 is used to estimate the derivative of the expectation with respect to \u03bb i. This method was applied to convolutional networks and LSTMs, resulting in self-tuning CNNs (ST-CNNs) and self-tuning LSTMs (ST-LSTMs).

STNs discovered hyperparameter schedules that outperformed fixed values, optimizing hyperparameters online during training. Self-tuning networks (STNs) outperform fixed hyperparameters by discovering schedules for adapting hyperparameters online during training. STNs were compared to traditional optimization methods on CIFAR-10 and PTB datasets, showing superior performance. An ST-LSTM was used to tune output dropout rates, with the discovered schedule outperforming fixed rates. The schedule discovered by an ST-LSTM for output dropout outperforms fixed rates, achieving 82.58 vs 85.83 validation perplexity on the PTB corpus. This improvement is attributed to the schedule, not stochasticity from sampling hyperparameters. The fixed output dropout rate of 0.68 was found through grid search, resulting in 82.58 vs 85.83 validation perplexity. The improved performance is attributed to the schedule, not stochasticity from sampling hyperparameters. STNs outperformed standard LSTM with perturbations in dropout rate. During STN training, a standard LSTM was trained with perturbed dropout rates using random Gaussian and sinusoid perturbations. STNs outperformed both perturbation methods on the PTB word-level language modeling and CIFAR-10 image-classification tasks. Training a standard LSTM with the output dropout schedule discovered by ST-LSTM resulted in performance close to STN, suggesting limited capacity of\u0175 \u03c6 acts as a regularizer. The limited capacity of \u0175 \u03c6 acts as a regularizer, as shown by training a standard LSTM with the output dropout schedule discovered by ST-LSTM. The schedule itself, rather than other aspects of STN, was responsible for the performance improvement. Additionally, using the final dropout value found by STN did not result in as good performance as using the schedule. The STN's schedule, rather than other aspects, improved performance. Training a standard LSTM with the final dropout value from STN did not perform as well as following the schedule. The STN discovers the same schedule regardless of initial hyperparameter values. The STN schedule implements a curriculum by using a low dropout rate early in training, aiding optimization, and then gradually increasing the dropout. Hyperparameters adapt over a shorter timescale than weights, leading to equilibration in training. At any point in training, hyperparameter adaptation has equilibrated. Low regularization is best early on, while higher regularization is better later. The STN schedule implements a curriculum with a low dropout rate early on, gradually increasing for better generalization. Evaluated on the PTB corpus, a 2-layer LSTM with 650 hidden units and 650-dimensional word embeddings was used.

Comparison was made with grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization, showing the lowest validation loss achieved over time. The study compared STNs to grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization for tuning 15 hyperparameters. STNs found better configurations in less time, as shown in FIG4 and Table 2. The hyperparameter schedules found by STN are illustrated in FIG3. Bilevel Optimization is also discussed in BID10. The final validation and test losses for each method are shown in Table 2. STNs find better hyperparameter configurations in less time. The hyperparameter schedules found by STN are illustrated in FIG3. Bilevel Optimization is discussed with references to linear, quadratic, or convex constraints. In the context of discussing hyperparameter configurations and schedules found by STNs, bilevel optimization is explored with references to linear, quadratic, or convex constraints. The work involves replacing lower-level problems with KKT conditions as constraints for upper-level problems, resembling trust-region methods and evolutionary techniques used to estimate best-response functions iteratively. Hypernetworks, initially considered by Schmidhuber, are functions mapping to neural net weights. Our work is similar to trust-region methods and evolutionary techniques used to estimate best-response functions iteratively. Hypernetworks, introduced by Schmidhuber, map to neural net weights and have been used to generate weights for CNNs and RNNs. Unlike other approaches, our method does not optimize the architecture during training, requiring a large hypernetwork. Hypernetworks are used to generate weights for CNNs and RNNs, with different approaches for predicting weights in neural nets. Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization involves approximating the value of weights after gradient descent steps. Gradient-Based Hyperparameter Optimization involves two main approaches for approximating the value of weights after gradient descent steps. The first approach uses differentiation to approximate the gradient, while the second approach utilizes the Implicit Function Theorem under certain conditions. The first approach approximates \u2202w * /\u2202\u03bb(\u03bb 0 ) using differentiation, proposed by BID13 and utilized by various studies. The second approach, developed for hyperparameter optimization in neural networks, uses the Implicit Function Theorem. Similar approaches have been applied in log-linear models, kernel selection, and image reconstruction. Both approaches face challenges with certain hyperparameters during gradient descent. Optimization techniques in neural networks have been developed and applied in various fields such as log-linear models, kernel selection, and image reconstruction. However, challenges arise with certain hyperparameters during gradient descent, making differentiation and computation of Hessian-vector products expensive. Differentiating gradient descent becomes expensive as the number of steps increases, requiring Hessian-vector products with conjugate gradient solvers. Model-based hyperparameter optimization, like Bayesian optimization, models the conditional probability of performance given hyperparameters and dataset. Various methods can be used to model this probability. Model-Based Hyperparameter Optimization involves using Bayesian optimization to model the conditional probability of performance based on hyperparameters and dataset. Different methods can be used for this modeling, and an acquisition function is used to balance exploration and exploitation in choosing the next hyperparameters to train on iteratively. Assumptions on learning curve behavior can help avoid training each model to completion. Model-Based Hyperparameter Optimization uses Bayesian optimization to model performance based on hyperparameters and dataset. An acquisition function balances exploration and exploitation in choosing the next hyperparameters to train on iteratively. Model-free approaches like grid search are also used for hyperparameter optimization. Our approach differs from existing methods like grid search and random search in hyperparameter optimization by incorporating inductive biases into the model, leveraging network structure, and scaling efficiently with the number of hyperparameters. In contrast, model-free approaches such as Successive Halving and Hyperband do not take advantage of problem structure like our method, which utilizes rich gradient information. Model-free approaches like grid search and random search are advocated by BID3, with Successive Halving and Hyperband extending random search using multi-armed bandit techniques. These methods do not consider problem structure but are easily parallelizable and perform well. Population Based Training (PBT) considers hyperparameter schedules by training a population of networks in parallel. Population Based Training (PBT) involves training a population of networks in parallel, periodically evaluating their performance and replacing under-performing networks with better ones. This method also copies and perturbs hyperparameters for training new network clones, allowing for different hyperparameter settings to be experienced. Self-Tuning Networks (STNs) efficiently approximate the best-response of parameters to hyperparameters by scaling and shifting their hidden layers. STNs replace the population of networks with a single best-response approximation and use gradients to tune hyperparameters during training.

The Jacobian of \u2202f /\u2202w decomposes as a block matrix with sub-blocks. f is C 2 in a neighborhood of (\u03bb 0 , w 0 ), so \u2202f /\u2202w is continuously differentiable. The Hessian \u2202 2 f /\u2202w 2 is positive definite and invertible at (\u03bb 0 , w 0 ). By the Implicit Function Theorem, there exists a unique continuously differentiable function w * : V \u2192 R m such that \u2202f /\u2202w(\u03bb, w * (\u03bb)) = 0 for \u03bb \u2208 V and w * (\u03bb 0 ) = w 0.

By the Implicit Function Theorem, there exists a unique continuously differentiable function w * : V \u2192 R m such that \u2202f /\u2202w(\u03bb, w * (\u03bb)) = 0 for \u03bb \u2208 V and w * (\u03bb 0 ) = w 0. Using second-order sufficient optimality conditions, we conclude that w * (\u03bb) is the unique solution to Problem 4b for all \u03bb \u2208 U. This discussion is based on Hastie et al. (2001). The data matrix X is decomposed using SVD into orthogonal matrices U and V, and a diagonal matrix D. The function y(x; w) is simplified by setting u = s Q, leading to y(x; w) = s Qx = u x. The Jacobian \u2202y /\u2202x \u2261 u. The SVD decomposition of the data matrix X results in orthogonal matrices U and V, and a diagonal matrix D. The function y(x; w) is further simplified by setting u = s Q, leading to a constant Jacobian \u2202y /\u2202x \u2261 u. The optimal solution minimizing the L2-regularized least-squares linear regression is given by u * (\u03bb). The Jacobian \u2202y /\u2202x \u2261 u is constant, simplifying Problem 13 to standard L2-regularized least-squares linear regression. The optimal solutions u * (\u03bb) and u * are well-known. Q0 = V and s0 solve the unregularized regression problem, with s0 = D\u22121Ut. The optimal solution to the unregularized version of Problem 19 is given by Q0s0 = u*, where Q0 = V and s0 = D\u22121Ut. Best-response functions Q*(\u03bb) = \u03c3(\u03bbv + c) row Q0 and s*(\u03bb) = s0 are chosen to satisfy Q(\u03bb)s(\u03bb) = v*(\u03bb). The optimal solution to Problem 19 is Q0s0 = u*, where Q0 = V and s0 = D\u22121Ut. Best-response functions Q*(\u03bb) = \u03c3(\u03bbv + c) row Q0 and s*(\u03bb) = s0 are chosen to satisfy Q(\u03bb)s(\u03bb) = v*(\u03bb).

The model parameters were updated, but hyperparameters were not updated, and training was terminated when the learning rate dropped below 0.0003. Variational dropout was tuned. The best-response Jacobian was approximated using the first-order Taylor series of w* about \u03bb0. Variational dropout was tuned on the input, hidden state, and output of the LSTM, along with embedding dropout. Regularization was applied to the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix. We applied variational dropout to the LSTM input, hidden state, and output, along with embedding dropout. DropConnect was used to regularize the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix, and activation regularization was also implemented. DropConnect was used to regularize the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix in the LSTM model. Activation regularization (AR) and temporal activation regularization (TAR) were also applied to penalize large activations and promote slowness, respectively. Scaling coefficients were tuned for AR and TAR regularization.

The ST-CNN model demonstrated robustness to hyperparameter initialization, with low regularization aiding optimization in the initial epochs. Curriculum learning, such as BID2, is part of a family of continuation methods that optimize non-convex functions by solving a sequence of functions ordered by increasing difficulty. Curriculum learning, like BID2, is a continuation method that optimizes non-convex functions by solving a sequence of functions ordered by increasing difficulty. It involves optimizing simpler versions of the problem before gradually increasing the parameter \u03bb from 0 to 1. This method is believed to aid optimization and improve generalization. Hyperparameter schedules implement a form of curriculum learning by gradually increasing a parameter \u03bb from 0 to 1 while optimizing a simpler version of the problem. This method is believed to aid optimization and improve generalization. Hyperparameter schedules implement curriculum learning by gradually increasing parameters like dropout over time to make the learning problem more challenging. Grid searches were conducted to analyze the effects of different hyperparameter settings, showing that greedy schedules can outperform fixed values. Validation perplexity was measured for various combinations of input and output dropout values at different epochs during training. During training, grid searches were conducted to analyze the effects of different hyperparameter settings on validation perplexity. The results showed that greedy hyperparameter schedules can outperform fixed values, with larger dropout rates leading to better performance as training progresses. An example was presented to illustrate the benefits of greedy schedules. During training, grid searches were conducted to analyze the effects of different hyperparameter settings on validation perplexity. The results showed that larger dropout rates lead to better performance as training progresses. A simple example demonstrated the benefits of greedy hyperparameter schedules, showing that taking the best output dropout value in each epoch yields better generalization than fixed hyperparameter values. During training, a fine-grained grid search was conducted to optimize the output dropout hyperparameter values. The schedule formed by selecting the best dropout value at each epoch resulted in improved generalization compared to fixed values. The strategy involved using small dropout values initially for a rapid decrease in validation perplexity, followed by larger dropout values for better overall performance. The schedule achieved improved generalization by selecting the best dropout values at each epoch. The perturbed values for output dropout were used to investigate the regularization effect of STNs. PyTorch code listings for HyperLinear and HyperConv2D classes are provided for constructing ST-LSTMs and ST-CNNs. In Section 4.1, we investigated whether the improved performance of STNs is due to regularization rather than the schedule. PyTorch code listings for constructing ST-LSTMs and ST-CNNs using HyperLinear and HyperConv2D classes are provided, along with simplified optimization steps for the training and validation sets."
