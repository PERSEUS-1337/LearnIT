The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. For FY2008, the President requested $324.2 million for the program, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million, also including $310 million for the state grant program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding amounts for the SDFSC program, with the House recommending $526.0 million and the Senate recommending $492.5 million, both including $310 million for state grants. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The 107th Congress reauthorized and appropriated $568.8 million for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities (SDFSC) program in FY2006. This includes $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The No Child Left Behind Act amended and reauthorized the SDFSC program as Part A of Title IV\u201421st Century Schools. The No Child Left Behind Act reauthorized the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program, providing funds to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, and outlying areas in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. The SDFSC program is a federal initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, and outlying areas in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. Funds also support national programs to prevent drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. Funds from the SDFSC program support state and national programs to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. $650 million was authorized for state grants for FY2002, with funds reserved for specific territories. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants under the SDFSC program. Funds are reserved for specific territories and programs for Indian youth, native Hawaiians, and states based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants under the SDFSC program. Funds are reserved for specific territories and programs for Indian youth, native Hawaiians, and states based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. A portion of the funds is distributed to the states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on a formula involving school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Each state receives no less than 0.5% of the total allotted amount or the amount received in FY2001. If total appropriations are less than the FY2001 level, each state receives an equal proportional share. State grants are distributed based on a formula involving population and concentration grants. Each state receives no less than 0.5% of the total amount or the FY2001 level. If appropriations are lower than FY2001, states receive an equal share. Funds can be redistributed if not used within two years. National program funds cannot increase without a 10% rise in state grant funding. For FY2006, each state receives a proportional share of its grant, with the possibility of redistribution if funds are not used within two years. A limitation on increasing national program funds without a 10% rise in state grant funding was negated for FY2006 due to lower appropriations. The Administration did not propose funding for FY2007. The FY2006 limitation on increasing national program funds without a 10% rise in state grant funding was negated due to lower appropriations. For FY2007, the Administration did not propose funding for state grants. 20% of the total state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts, with a maximum of 3% for administrative costs. The Administration did not suggest funding for state grants, so the limitation provision would not need to be considered. 20% of the total state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts, with a maximum of 3% for administrative costs. An SEA must distribute at least 93% of its allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention and education programs. In FY2002, SEAs must distribute 93% of funds to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. 60% is based on ESEA Title I, Part A funding, and 40% on school enrollments. LEAs can use up to 2% for administrative costs. SEAs can use up to 3% for program administration. Additionally, 1% of the allotment can be used for a management information system. In FY2002, SEAs could use up to 3% of their allotments for program administration. Additionally, they could use 1% of their allotment to implement a uniform management information and reporting system (UMIRS) to collect information on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. The UMIRS was created to collect data on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. SEAs could allocate up to 5% of funds for state activities such as planning. The PART instrument was developed by the Administration to assess program performance in schools, focusing on curricula, programs, services, drug use, violence among minors, and risk perception. SEAs can use up to 5% of funds for state activities like capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" by the PART instrument in 2002 and 2006 due to a lack of demonstrated program effectiveness and funds being spread too thinly for quality interventions. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" in 2002 and 2006 because funds were distributed too thinly to support quality interventions, with approximately 64% of LEAs receiving less than $10,000 per year. The program did not have a track record of producing measurable results. The state grants program of the SDFSC was deemed ineffective due to insufficient funding for quality interventions, with 64% of LEAs receiving less than $10,000 per year. The program lacked measurable outcomes, leading to its termination in favor of higher-priority programs. The Administration proposed to terminate the state grants program of the SDFSC in order to fund higher-priority national programs that were deemed more promising in achieving important results in drug and violence prevention. The Administration believed that national programs under SDFSC had more potential to achieve results in drug and violence prevention compared to state grants. The Department of Education planned to use national survey data to assess the effectiveness of these programs. The Department of Education's strategy to assess the effectiveness of state grants programs in drug and violence prevention involves using national survey data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. This data will help determine the extent of teen drug use and violence nationwide, along with evaluating how well research-based programs are being implemented by grant recipients. Additionally, the Department is conducting a rigorous evaluation to measure positive outcomes. The program aims to use national survey data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to assess teen drug use and violence nationwide. The Department of Education is conducting a rigorous evaluation to measure the impact of interventions and support states in improving their data collection and analysis for SDFSC programs. Funding is authorized for FY2002 through FY2007. The evaluation uses rigorous methodology to measure the impact of interventions and support states in improving data collection for SDFSC programs. National programs are funded for FY2002 through FY2007 to prevent violence and drug use among students. The ED Secretary consults with other agencies to administer programs aimed at preventing violence and illegal drug use among students. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative continues to receive necessary funding. The National Coordinator Initiative allows LEAs to recruit, hire, and train personnel. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was created under national programs allowing LEAs to recruit, hire, and train persons to serve as SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. ED officials believed that middle school students were at the age where they were most likely to begin experimenting with drugs and becoming more involved in violence and crime. NCLBA expanded the coverage of this permissive activity for national coordinators to serve as drug prevention and school safety coordinators. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. The National Coordinator Initiative allowed LEAs to hire SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools to address drug and safety issues. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004. National program funds could be allocated to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Funding for the National Coordinator Initiative, which aimed to address drug and safety issues in schools, was terminated in FY2004. States may receive national program funds as formula grants based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants may also be awarded to LEAs for developing and implementing programs. Title I, Part A concentration grants for the preceding fiscal year ensure that no state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted. Competitive grants can be awarded to LEAs for programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Grants are available for LEAs and community-based groups to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for localities affected by hate crimes and a School Security Technology and Resource Center at Sandia National Laboratories. The ED Secretary can make grants to LEAs and community-based groups to assist localities affected by hate crimes and establish a School Security Technology and Resource Center at Sandia National Laboratories for school security assessment and technology development. The Sandia National Laboratories, in partnership with other organizations, will establish a National Center for School and Youth Safety to provide emergency assistance and establish a student hotline for reporting violent behavior. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with funds allocated for state grants and national programs. Additionally, a National Center for School and Youth Safety will be established to provide emergency assistance, establish a student hotline for reporting violent behavior, and offer consultation on school safety best practices. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with funds allocated for state grants and national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants and $216.0 million for national programs.

For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs, $6.3 million less than FY2006. The Administration cited fiscal constraints and an ineffective state grants component for not requesting state grant funding. The Administration did not request state grant funding for FY2007 due to fiscal constraints and an ineffective state grants component. The President requested $216.0 million for national programs, $6.3 million less than FY2006. Additionally, for FY2008, funding was not requested for the mentoring program, as FY2007 marked the final year of a two-year phase-out that was believed to have met its objectives. For FY2008, the President did not request funding for the mentoring program, which received $19 million in FY2007 as part of a two-year phase-out. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, with a slight reduction due to a 1% budget cut. In FY2006, Congress appropriated $48.8 million for mentoring, slightly lower than the requested $49.3 million due to a 1% budget reduction. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program from FY2005 to FY2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for it in FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration slightly lowered mentoring funding to $48.8 million in FY2006. Funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program was not requested from FY2005 to FY2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for it in FY2005 and FY2006. Funding for the program was slightly reduced to $32.4 million in FY2006.

In FY2006, funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program was slightly reduced to $32.4 million. For FY2007, the House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for the program, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million, the same as the previous year. The SDFSC program continues to operate at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. The Gun-Free Schools Act was incorporated into the SDFSCA due to its close relationship with the program. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was incorporated into the SDFSCA program, requiring states to have laws expelling students who bring weapons to school for one year. LEAs can modify this requirement on a case-by-case basis. GFSA allows expelled students to receive educational services in an alternative setting. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) mandates states to have laws expelling students who bring weapons to school for one year. LEAs can adjust this requirement case-by-case. States can allow LEAs to provide educational services to expelled students in alternative settings. LEAs seeking SEA assistance through GFSA funds must ensure compliance with expulsion requirements and provide details on the circumstances of expulsions. The Gun-Free Schools Act requires states to expel students who bring weapons to school for one year. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements and report details to the ED Secretary annually. GFSA funds cannot be received without a policy for reporting students who bring firearms to school. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, but all were referred to the appropriate committees.

H.R. 283, introduced by Representative Sanchez, aimed to cover bullying, gang prevention, drug, and violence prevention under SDFSCA. The bill also proposed amending the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to create accountability-based programs. H.R. 284, introduced during the 109th Congress, aimed to amend SDFSCA to include bullying and harassment prevention programs. It also proposed creating accountability-based programs under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to enhance school safety. H.R. 284 and H.R. 3655 were introduced to enhance school safety by including bullying and harassment prevention programs under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) and the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) aimed to improve school safety by addressing bullying and harassment through prevention programs. Representative Baca introduced H.R. 3655 in 2005, directing the Education Secretary to revise guidelines for state and local prevention programs. H.R. 5295, introduced by Representative Geoff Davis in 2006, focused on student and teacher safety measures. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) aimed to improve school safety by revising guidelines for state and local prevention programs. Introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, the bill passed the House and was referred to the Senate HELP Committee. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) introduced by Representative Geoff Davis aimed to improve school safety by allowing full-time teachers to search students under reasonable suspicion for weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials on school property. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to award grants for statewide pilot programs to test school safety measures, including allowing full-time teachers to search students for weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials on school property. Non-compliant LEAs would risk losing SDFSCA funds after FY2008. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) directed the ED Secretary to award grants for statewide pilot programs testing high school students for performance-enhancing drug use. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA and increase state grants authorization level. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) introduced by Senator Menendez aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization level, and allocate funds for national programs. It would require LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention/safety program staff. The bill aimed to increase the authorization level for state grants to $700 million for FY2007 and allocate $400 million for national programs. It required LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention/safety program staff. Additionally, it reserved $50 million for mentoring program grants and gave priority to entities serving elementary and middle school children. The bill aimed to increase state grants to $700 million for FY2007, allocate $400 million for national programs, and require LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention/safety program staff. It also reserved $50 million for mentoring program grants, prioritizing entities serving elementary and middle school children in high-need areas. Additionally, an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant would reserve $50 million for competitive grants to nonprofit groups for creating programs. The bill proposed increasing state grants to $700 million for FY2007, allocating funds for national programs, hiring gang prevention coordinators, and drug prevention/safety program staff. It also included an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of $50 million for nonprofit groups to create programs targeting teens in high-crime communities. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to combat gang activity in schools and communities by providing grants to nonprofit groups for innovative programs targeting teens in high-crime areas. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to improve school safety by allowing students in unsafe environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district. The SAVE Act allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools. Counseling or removal of offenders may also be an option. H.R. 354 allows students who are victims of violent crimes at school, on a school bus, or at a school function to transfer to a safe school within the same district, including public charter schools. This differs from current law by expanding the scope of protection beyond just persistently dangerous schools. H.R. 354 allows students who are victims of violent crimes at school to transfer to a safe public school within the same district, including public charter schools. The bill does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and extends protection to incidents on school buses or at school functions. It also provides options for counseling or removal of the offender. The bill was referred to the House Education and Labor Committee, with no further action taken. In the 110th Congress, the SDFSCA may be considered for reauthorization. H.R. 354, referred to the House Education and Labor Committee, offers protection for students involved in violent incidents at school or school-related events. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to create safe, drug-free school environments. The Administration proposes restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free school environments through a consolidated discretionary grant program. The program would prioritize emergency planning, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture and climate, and other needs to improve the learning environment for students. The discretionary grant program proposed by the Administration would prioritize emergency planning, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture and climate, and other needs to improve the learning environment for students. Congress may also consider requiring K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies. Policy makers may consider requiring K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies, as there is currently no federal mandate for this. The Department of Education relies on self-reported surveys and academic studies for data on school crime, but giving the responsibility to the Department of Justice, with its expertise in public safety and crime data analysis, could be considered. The Department of Education relies on self-reported surveys and academic studies for school crime data, but there is no federal mandate for reporting incidents to law enforcement. Consideration could be given to the Department of Justice taking responsibility for school safety and crime data collection, as they have expertise in public safety and crime analysis beyond the scope of the Department of Education. The Department of Justice could take over school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education, as they have expertise beyond the scope of ED. One suggestion is to restructure state grant programs, with ED focusing on drug and alcohol prevention, suicide prevention, and curriculum-based programs in collaboration with HHS. One suggestion is to restructure the responsibility for state grant programs, with ED focusing on drug and alcohol prevention, suicide prevention, and curriculum-based programs in collaboration with HHS. School safety, security, and emergency preparedness programs could be placed under the direction of DOJ for its public safety expertise. Another option could be legislation allowing K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for increased security. One potential option is legislation that would enable K-12 schools to seek Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for enhanced security and emergency preparedness to guard against potential terrorist attacks. Consideration could be given to including K-12 schools in national Critical Infrastructure programs. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, as modified by the No Child Left Behind Act, may have unintended consequences. The DHS funding for increased security and emergency preparedness to protect against possible terrorist attacks on schools and school buses is being considered. There are concerns about unintended consequences of the Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, which allows students to transfer from persistently dangerous schools to safer ones. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA allows students to transfer from persistently dangerous schools to safer ones, but this may lead to unintended consequences such as pressure on state officials to define dangerous schools in a way that local schools never meet the criteria. Legal concerns may also arise as definitions of \"persistently dangerous\" vary between states, and some school officials may underreport crime and violence to avoid negative labels. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, which could impact funding for violence prevention grants. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting their chances of receiving funding for violence prevention grants. The lack of data prevents them from qualifying for grants, and there is no funding available to help schools improve safety programs once labeled as persistently dangerous."
