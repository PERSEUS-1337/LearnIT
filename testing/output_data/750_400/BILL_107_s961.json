According to findings by Congress, an estimated 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants over the last 35 years. In 1999, 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that in 1999, 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and 167,318 American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. FDA received 127,770 adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled implants from 1985 until January 2000. Women need complete and accurate information about the potential health risks and advantages of breast implants. Silicone gel-filled breast implants had 127,770 adverse reaction reports, while saline-filled implants had 65,720 reports from 1985 to January 2000. Women require accurate information on the risks and benefits of breast implants to make informed decisions. Silicone implants were never FDA-approved, while saline implants received approval in 2000. Silicone breast implants were never FDA-approved; saline implants, approved in 2000, had high complication rates. 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications after three years. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery due to complications and device failure. In 1998, the FDA investigated breast implant manufacturers for manipulating research data. FDA panel in 2000 considered market approval for saline implants. The FDA conducted a criminal investigation into a breast implant manufacturer for manipulating research data. The manufacturer's saline breast implant was approved in May 2000, but the investigation is ongoing. A 1997 Mayo Clinic study found that 1 in 4 women with breast implants required additional surgery within 5 years. The FDA is investigating a breast implant manufacturer for manipulating research data. A 1997 Mayo Clinic study found that 1 in 4 women with breast implants needed additional surgery within 5 years. Research in 2000 showed that 70% of women with implants had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. In 2000, FDA research found that 70% of women with breast implants had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migrating in 21% of cases. The relationship between free silicone and disease development is unknown. A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. at the University of California found a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with silicone breast implants, suggesting serious implications from their use. The 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. at the University of California found a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with silicone breast implants, indicating potential serious implications from their use. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study on silicone breast implant safety highlighted local complications as the primary concern, emphasizing the need for more research on these issues. The 1999 Institute of Medicine study on silicone breast implant safety emphasized the importance of studying local complications, as they are the primary safety concern. Concerns remain about potential connective tissue or autoimmune diseases from exposure to silicone implants. A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found higher rates of lung and brain issues in breast implant recipients. Concerns persist regarding the safety of silicone breast implants, with studies showing higher rates of lung and brain cancer among recipients. Evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured implants has led to severe local inflammation. A 1999 case report found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured silicone breast implants, leading to severe local inflammation and complications. Once silicone gel leaves the implant, it can elicit profound pathologic responses. Complications can arise from silicone migration to the axilla, arm, or abdominal wall. Studies show that once silicone gel escapes the implant, it can trigger severe pathological reactions. Silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms, potentially masking up to 40% of breast tissue and delaying early detection of breast cancer. The presence of silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms, potentially masking up to 40% of breast tissue and delaying early detection of breast cancer. Women considering breast implants should be aware of the negative impact on breast feeding. According to a 2000 FDA publication, women of childbearing age should be aware of the negative impact of breast implants on breast feeding. It is unknown if silicone from implants can pass into breast milk and its effects on nursing infants. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants and ensure women receive accurate information. The Act aims to promote research on the health effects of breast implants and ensure women receive accurate information. It also encourages the FDA to conclude its investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by implant manufacturers that may impact the health of American women. The Act encourages the FDA to conclude its criminal investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by implant manufacturers that may affect the health of American women. It clarifies that existing regulations regarding silicone breast implants for reconstruction, correction of deformities, and replacement for ruptured implants remain unaffected. The National Institutes of Health will provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act adds a section on breast implant research.

The Director of NIH appoints a Department of Health and Human Services official as the National Institutes of Health coordinator for breast implant research, coordinating research efforts. The NIH will review grant applications for research on breast implants to ensure high quality and appropriate design. Additionally, the Director will conduct or support research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants. The Director of NIH will conduct or support research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study of women with implants for at least eight years, focusing on differentiating between mastectomy, reconstructive, and cosmetic purposes, as well as subsets of women with saline and silicone implants. A study on women with breast implants for at least eight years should focus on local complications like capsular contracture, leakage, and rupture, as well as atypical symptoms, silicone migration, and immune system irregularities. It should also compare their health to suitable controls. The study on women with breast implants for at least eight years will evaluate local complications such as capsular contracture, leakage, loss of nipple sensation, deflation, and rupture, as well as atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities.
