    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal is an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Act establishes a pilot project for implementing this proposal in specific national forests. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal promotes ecologic and economic health for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. A pilot project is required by the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct on specified Federal lands after completing an environmental impact statement. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Forest Service, will conduct a pilot project on specified Federal lands to demonstrate resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement and demonstrate resource management activities in a pilot project on Federal lands in California as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal recommends a pilot project in California's Lassen National Forest and Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. The project area is designated as \"Available for Group Selection\" on a map dated June 1993. All spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers within the pilot project area are excluded. The pilot project in California's Lassen National Forest and Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest excludes all spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers within the designated project area from resource management activities and timber harvesting during the project term. The Regional Forester for region 5 will oversee compliance with these exclusions. During the pilot project in California's Lassen National Forest and Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest, resource management activities and timber harvesting are deferred on Federal lands within specified areas. The Regional Forester for region 5 will ensure compliance with these restrictions. All road building and timber harvesting activities are prohibited on designated Federal lands in California's Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. Riparian protection guidelines apply to all resource management activities. The guidelines for riparian system protection apply to resource management and timber harvesting activities in the pilot project area. The guidelines for riparian system protection in the pilot project area include activities conducted under subsection (d) and all timber harvesting activities during the project term. These guidelines are based on a Forest Service research document from March 1993 co-authored by the Scientific Analysis Team, including Dr. Jack Ward Thomas. The Forest Service research document from March 1993, co-authored by the Scientific Analysis Team including Dr. Jack Ward Thomas, provides guidelines for resource management activities in compliance with applicable Federal law and standards for the conservation of the California spotted owl. During the pilot project, resource management activities on Federal lands must comply with applicable Federal law and conservation guidelines for the California spotted owl. During the pilot project, the Secretary will implement resource management activities on Federal lands in accordance with the California Spotted Owl Sierran Provence Interim Guidelines or subsequent final guidelines. This includes constructing fuelbreaks using various vegetation management methods. The pilot project area will involve constructing fuelbreaks using vegetation management methods like thinning and individual tree selection on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year. Group selection and individual tree selection will be utilized for uneven-aged forest management. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal involves group selection and individual tree selection for uneven-aged forest management on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year. Group selection will be done on an average acreage of .57 percent of the pilot project area land each year. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal aims to achieve fire-resilient forests through group and individual tree selection on up to 70,000 acres annually. The pilot project aims to implement resource management activities on up to 70,000 acres annually, including individual tree selection and riparian management for wide protection zones and restoration projects. The Secretary will ensure cost-effectiveness during the project. The pilot project aims to implement resource management activities on up to 70,000 acres annually, including riparian management with wide protection zones and restoration projects. The Secretary will ensure cost-effectiveness in implementing these activities. Funding for the project will be sourced according to relevant guidelines. The Secretary will use cost-effective means to implement resource management activities for the pilot project. Funding will come from specific Forest Service funds and excess allocations. The Secretary will use specific Forest Service funds and excess allocations for resource management activities according to the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. Prohibition on using funds allocated for other National Forest units. During a pilot project, the forest supervisors of Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest have flexibility to allocate and use excess funds for resource management activities. The Secretary is prohibited from using funds allocated for other National Forest units. During a pilot project, forest supervisors of Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests can use excess funds for resource management activities. The Secretary is restricted from using these funds for other National Forest units. The forest supervisors of Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests can use excess funds for resource management activities, with restrictions to ensure other multiple use activities are not limited. Forest supervisors of Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests can use excess funds for resource management activities, with restrictions to ensure other multiple use activities are not limited. Up to 12 percent of available funds can be used for general administration, with at least 88 percent allocated for implementing required activities. Authorized supplemental funds are also available. Authorized supplemental funds are available to be appropriated as necessary for implementing and carrying out the pilot project. Baseline funds for resource management activities must include existing funding levels. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate necessary funds for the pilot project. Baseline funds for resource management activities must meet existing funding levels. The pilot project will run from the enactment of the Act until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for Plumas. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate necessary funds for the pilot project, with baseline funding levels meeting existing levels. The project will run from the enactment of the Act until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest. Within 180 days after the commencement of the pilot project, the Forest Service may use private contracts to carry out the requirements of the section in consultation with the Quincy Library Group. Within 180 days of the pilot project's start, the Forest Service can use private contracts in consultation with the Quincy Library Group to fulfill the requirements. Additionally, the Regional Forester for Region 5 must begin amending the land and resource management plans for specific national forests within the same timeframe. The Regional Forester for Region 5 must start amending the land and resource management plans for Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest within 180 days of the pilot project's initiation. The process should include preparing an alternative that incorporates the pilot project, resource management activities, and aspects of the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal, along with other necessary changes.
