Differences between the two versions are resolved in a conference committee. Congressional staff receive numerous requests for information on these bills. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. After the passage of these bills by both chambers, a conference committee is convened to resolve differences. Congressional staff receive many requests for information on these bills. This report highlights personnel-related issues of interest and compares differences between House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The report summarizes key highlights of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA), comparing differences between House and Senate versions. It mentions the passage of S. 1356 by both chambers and the President's veto of an earlier version, H.R. 1735, before signing P.L. 114-92. The House passed the FY2016 NDAA on November 5, 2015, which was later signed by the President on November 25, 2015. The President vetoed an earlier version of the bill, H.R. 1735, on October 22, 2015, citing concerns about exceeding defense spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President vetoed bill H.R. 1735 due to concerns about exceeding defense spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. He later signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending in FY2016. The President vetoed bill H.R. 1735 for exceeding defense spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending in FY2016, leading to modifications in the NDAA bill to comply with the revised caps. The initial bill H.R. 1735 was modified to comply with revised spending caps while keeping military personnel provisions intact. The revised NDAA bill was substituted for S. 1356, passed by the House and Senate, and signed by the President. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills on various dates in 2015. Related CRS products offer more detailed background information and analysis. The amended version of S. 1356, the revised FY2016 NDAA, was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills on multiple dates in 2015. Related CRS products provide detailed background information and analysis. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2015 NDAA. The CRS report provides information and analysis on various issues, with contact information for analysts. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2015 NDAA. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 are outlined. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were outlined in the Defense Authorization Act. Congress increased the Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Authorized end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have fluctuated in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress increased personnel strength but began reversing these increases due to withdrawals and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were as follows: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (172,600). In anticipation of U.S. forces' withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress began reversing personnel increases post FY2006. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been decreasing since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), Air Force (312,980). Due to budget constraints, the Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, and the Marine Corps to 175,000-182,000 in FY2017-2019. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have varying planned reductions in active personnel strength due to budget constraints. The Army aims to decrease to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 by FY2017-2019. The Administration's request includes reductions for the Army but proposed level or increased strengths for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to FY2015. The Administration's request proposed reductions in Army strength but level or increased strengths for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to FY2015. The final bill authorized end-strengths identical to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which was 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to repeal 10 U.S.C. 691, which sets minimum end-strengths for the armed forces. The final bill authorized end-strengths identical to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which was 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to repeal 10 U.S.C. 691, which sets minimum end-strengths for the armed forces and allows the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel by up to 3% below authorized levels. The DOD budget must include amounts to maintain congressionally directed minimum strength levels. The initial Senate-passed bill allowed reductions in personnel numbers for active components, National Guard, and Reserve components, as well as for personnel performing active duty for operational support. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) allowed reductions in personnel numbers for active components, National Guard, and Reserve components by up to 2%, and for personnel performing active duty for operational support by up to 10%. It also adjusted the minimum end-strengths required by 10 USC 619 downward to slightly below the authorized end-strengths set in section 401. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) authorized reductions in personnel numbers for active components and reserve components by up to 2%, adjusting minimum end-strengths downward to slightly below authorized levels. The final bill authorized reductions in personnel numbers for active and reserve components by up to 2%, allowing the Secretary of Defense to decrease minimum end-strengths. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor.

Increasing concern with the overall cost of military personnel has led to a focus on the military pay raise, which is determined by a formula indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The proposed increase in basic pay for 2016 is 2.3%. The military pay raise for 2016 is determined by a formula indexed to the Employment Cost Index, with a proposed increase of 2.3%. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% raise, lower than the statutory formula. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%, in line with DOD plans to limit pay increases through FY2020. The DOD Budget Request Overview projects limited pay raises of 1.3% in FY2017, 1.5% in FY2018 and FY2019, and 1.8% in FY2020. The DOD plans to limit basic pay increases through FY2020, with estimated ECI increases of 2.3% per year. Outyear pay raise planning factors assume limited pay raises of 1.3% in FY2017, 1.5% in FY2018 and FY2019, and 1.8% in FY2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay. The initial House bill (H.R. 1735) did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but the committee supported a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. The initial Senate version of the bill included a provision setting the pay increase at 1.3% for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade and maintaining the cap on officer pay at the Executive Schedule level II rate. The final bill (H.R. 1735) maintained a 1.3% pay increase for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade and capped officer pay at the Executive Schedule level II rate for 2014.

President Obama specified a 1.3% pay increase for 2016, but section 601 of the enacted bill freezes the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to provide recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) was established by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 to provide recommendations on modernizing pay and benefits for the armed services. The Commission's final report and recommendations were delivered to Congress on January 29, 2015, with many proposed changes included in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission delivered its final report and recommendations to Congress on January 29, 2015. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with government matching contributions through the Thrift Savings Plan. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay as a retention incentive. The new military retirement system will implement a reduced multiplier for the defined benefit to 2.0% from 2.5% and authorize continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering the military before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while those with less than 12 years of service on December 31, 2017 can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed.

Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received significant attention in recent years, leading to changes in previous NDAAs. The final version of the bill includes various provisions addressing this issue. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted the prevalence of unwanted sexual contact among military personnel, with 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men experiencing such incidents in 2014. The bill addressed legal procedures, policies, and programs for military sexual assaults. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report revealed that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. Social retaliation was reported by 53% of those who experienced unwanted sexual contact, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting. The Government Accountability Office identified a need for improvements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified a need for the DOD to enhance care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault by enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified a need for the DOD to enhance care for male sexual assault victims.

On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women to serve in previously restricted combat occupations, with a deadline of January 1, 2016 for reviews and implementation plans. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the rescinding of the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule, allowing women to serve in previously restricted combat occupations. The military services were given until January 1, 2016, to conduct reviews and develop implementation plans. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter later declared that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress had established requirements for \"gender-neutral\" occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established requirements for \"gender-neutral\" occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 and subsequent years directed DOD on their development and application. Section 524 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ''Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 emphasized the need for performance standards related to the service of women in the Armed Forces. The Carl Levin and Howard P. ''Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 directed DOD on developing and applying gender-neutral occupational performance standards. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for combat unit readiness standards, potentially requiring validation efforts for unit-level performance. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness, requiring DOD to validate unit-level performance. DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies affecting females under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7652. Congress had 30 days to review changes before DOD could implement them. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortens the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies affecting females under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7652 from 30 days in continuous session to 30 calendar days. This change provides a more definitive timeline for DOD implementation and reduces the in-session time for Congress to review and act on proposed changes. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortens the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies affecting females under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7652 from 30 days in continuous session to 30 calendar days, providing a more definitive timeline for DOD implementation and reducing Congress' in-session review time. The congressionally mandated Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially impacting servicemembers, military families, and readiness.

The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially impacting servicemembers, military families, and readiness. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. Enhancing personal financial management training programs could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill includes provisions for financial literacy training at various points in a servicemember's career. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires financial literacy training for servicemembers at different career points, such as entry into service, life changes, and transitions. Military retirement system changes may also necessitate enhanced financial management training. The statutory requirements for enlistment in the active component differ from those in the reserve components. Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504, an individual must be a U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or a person described in the Compact of Free. Contact [author name scrubbed] at [phone number scrubbed]. The enlistment requirements for the reserve components under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504 include being a U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or falling under the Compact of Free Association. Service secretaries can make exceptions if enlistment is deemed vital to national interest. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions to enlistment requirements for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or individuals who have previously served in the armed forces. The program is based on a provision in Title 10 of the United States Code that allows service secretaries to make exceptions if enlistment is vital to national interest. Section 513 of a Senate-passed bill would have linked statutory requirements. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions to enlistment requirements for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or individuals who have previously served in the armed forces. Section 12102 of Title 10 specifies eligibility criteria. The enacted bill did not include a provision linking reserve component enlistment requirements with active component requirements. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include a provision linking reserve component enlistment requirements with active component requirements. Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) in 2004 to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. Four years later, the Post\u20109/11 GI Bill provided more generous benefits, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP for new applicants. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) due to the more generous benefits provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The enacted bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The enacted bill terminated the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) four years after the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Only those enrolled in REAP prior to the enactment date could continue using the program.

The Senate bill (H.R. 1735) would entitle individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces. The Senate bill (H.R. 1735) would provide a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to veterans one year after discharge, verifying their military service with a photo and name. The Secretary of Defense could negotiate discounts with national retail chains for cardholders. The Senate bill (H.R. 1735) proposed a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans, verifying their military service with a photo and name. The Secretary of Defense could negotiate discounts with national retail chains for cardholders. An alternative option for honorably discharged veterans is to use state-issued ID cards that designate veteran status. The enacted bill did not include a provision for a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans. Veterans can use state-issued ID cards to show their veteran status in 44 states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, honorably separated members of the Uniformed Services can obtain an ID card through the joint DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. Veterans in 44 states and the District of Columbia can apply for a driver's license or ID card indicating veteran status. Since January 2014, honorably separated Uniformed Services members can obtain a military service proof ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue identification cards to veterans with proof of military service. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans who demonstrate their military service with official documents like the DD-214. This law aims to assist in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel in the armed forces by offering incentives such as educational benefits and bonus pay authorities. Congress has an ongoing interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel in the armed forces. The use of recruiting bonuses and incentives, such as educational benefits, helps attract well-qualified applicants. Section 531 of the House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would authorize service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. The pay authorities for recruitment incentives are outlined in Chapter 5 of Title 37 of the United States Code. Section 531 of the House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) allows service secretaries to develop up to three types of recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to a 30-day congressional review. Section 522 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes this provision. More information on recruitment and retention can be found in CRS Report RL32965. Implementation of the proposed recruitment incentive for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel would require a 30-day congressional review and approval period.

When reservists are called into active federal service, they are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under USERRA. This act allows for reemployment after military service, with a limit of five years cumulative service. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 grants the right to reemployment for those leaving civilian jobs for military service, with a five-year limit on cumulative service. Certain types of duty, such as reservist activations under specific authorities, are exempt from this limit. In 2011, Congress introduced new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 grants reemployment rights for military service with a five-year limit on cumulative service. Certain types of duty, like reservist activations under specific authorities, are exempt from this limit. In 2011, Congress introduced new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These new authorities are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 introduced new activation authorities for reservists, allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These activations are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit on military service. Section 565 of the House-passed bill aims to exempt military duty under these new authorities from counting towards the cumulative limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. Section 565 of the House-passed bill exempts military duty under new reserve activation authorities from the five-year cumulative limit on military service for reemployment protection under USERRA. A veteran is defined as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Not all types of service are considered active military service for most VA benefits. For more information on USERRA and mobilization authorities, refer to CRS Report RL30802. According to 38 U.S.C. 101(2), a veteran is someone who served in active military, naval, or air service and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service refers to full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Active service is defined as full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also includes active duty for training and periods of inactive duty for training where injuries or certain health conditions were incurred. Active service is defined as full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It includes active duty for training and periods of inactive duty for training where injuries or certain health conditions were incurred. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in law, and members of the National Guard and reserves who are never activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of veteran. Members of the National Guard and reserves who are never activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of veteran, even if they eventually qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of qualifying service. Reservists who qualify for reserve retirement may not necessarily be considered veterans unless they have completed the required active service. The House-passed bill honored reservists as veterans but did not provide additional benefits. The House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) initially honored reservists as veterans, but the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include this provision. Reservists must complete required active service to be considered veterans. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the House provision on reservists being considered veterans.

Section 1585 of Title 10, US Code authorizes DOD policies on carrying firearms on military bases. Section 1585 of Title 10, United States Code allows the Secretary of Defense to set policies for carrying firearms on military bases. Current DOD policies restrict the carrying of government-issued firearms to personnel on duty. Personal firearms are prohibited for military servicemembers on military installations. Following recent active shooter incidents on military installations, questions have been raised about the adequacy of force protection measures and current DOD policies regarding carrying personal firearms on military bases. The Reserve Center was attacked by an armed shooter, raising concerns about force protection measures at military installations. Some question whether DOD policies should be modified to allow servicemembers to carry firearms. An enacted bill would give more flexibility to commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would compel DOD to give more flexibility to commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action. Servicemembers may be authorized to carry firearms for force protection. On April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including six servicemembers. These servicemembers are ineligible for the Purple Heart award. The April 19, 1995 domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including six servicemembers. There is a debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart award. Supporters argue they were victims of terrorism, while opponents claim they were victims of domestic terrorism and do not qualify under current law. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility for servicemembers killed in the Oklahoma City bombing continues. Supporters argue they were victims of terrorism, while opponents claim they were victims of domestic terrorism and do not qualify under current law. Eligibility was expanded in the FY2015 NDAA to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. The FY2015 NDAA expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX, despite initial concerns over anti-Muslim overtones. The FY2015 NDAA expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded and killed in attacks by Muslim perpetrators angered over U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Section 571 redefined what constitutes an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for Purple Heart eligibility. The Purple Heart eligibility was expanded to include attacks by foreign terrorist organizations, requiring communication with the organization before the attack and motivation by the organization. However, servicemembers affected by the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill.

However, servicemembers affected by the Oklahoma City bombing will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years with Congress enacting laws and provisions in the NDAA related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to require the immediate termination of the Department of Defense practice of euthanizing military dogs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to end the euthanizing of military working dogs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 included language limiting liability claims related to the transfer of these dogs. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt military working dogs to include handlers, family members, and limited liability claims. Military working dogs were classified as \"equipment\" and adopters paid for transportation. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt military working dogs to include handlers, family members, and limited liability claims. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring MWDs to be transferred for adoption. The NDAA for FY2013 (P.L 112-239) allowed retiring military working dogs to be transferred stateside for adoption, including provisions for dogs located overseas to be brought back to the United States. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) does not require the Department of Defense to transfer retired military working dogs located overseas back to the United States. It includes provisions for retiring MWDs overseas to be transferred to the U.S. and gives adoption priority to former handlers, but does not change existing policy allowing law enforcement agencies to adopt MWDs. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) does not require the Department of Defense to transfer retired military working dogs located overseas back to the United States. It gives adoption priority to former handlers and aims to facilitate the domestic transfer of these dogs. Critics argue that the lack of appropriated funds for the transfer of retiring MWDs from abroad will make it costly.

The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act addressed military personnel policy issues and the Defense Commissary System. The President's FY2015 budget proposed cuts to the system, but funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA. The President's FY2015 budget proposed cuts to the Defense Commissary System, including $1 billion in cuts over three years. However, funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA with an additional $100 million added to the budget. The FY2016 budget request also proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries. The FY2015 NDAA added $100 million to the commissary budget to reverse the Administration's proposal to cut subsidies. The President's FY2016 budget request also proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, potentially leading to reduced operating days and hours for patrons. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, and 100% disabled veterans.

The Administration's FY2016 budget request included replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan and increasing copays for pharmaceuticals. In its FY2016 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health care options, including replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. However, only pharmaceutical copays were adopted in the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735).

However, only pharmaceutical copays were adopted in the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735). Recommendations for TRICARE changes from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission were not endorsed by the President or adopted in H.R. 1735. The President did not endorse recommendations for changes to TRICARE from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission, which were not adopted in H.R. 1735. Congress may consider major TRICARE benefit changes in the future, but a deliberate approach is advised according to the Senate report. The Senate report advises a deliberate approach to enacting TRICARE reform legislation, emphasizing the need to understand the implications and unintended consequences of any changes. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, and enhance the care experience for beneficiaries. The committee has recommended provisions in the TRICARE reform legislation to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience for beneficiaries, and control health care costs. These provisions lay the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future.

The goal is to modernize the system to meet the future needs of the Department of Defense, servicemembers, families, and retirees. The military health care system is in need of modernization to meet future needs. Reevaluation of all elements and potential increases in fees and co-pays are necessary for comprehensive reform. The Senate pharmacy provision is discussed separately. The military health care system requires modernization, including reevaluating all elements and potentially increasing fees and co-pays. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to various pharmacy options without copayments for active duty servicemembers. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program that allows prescriptions to be filled through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, and TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers do not have pharmacy copayments when using military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Non-formulary medicines are generally not available at military pharmacies.

Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues. Background: Recent news articles highlighted the quality of health care in the military health system. Secretary of Defense Hagel ordered a 90-day review last year, leading to an action plan. Some Members of Congress are interested in the plan's implementation. Sections 711 and 731 to 735 of the Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics through public access and reports to Congress. CBO estimated a cost of about $95. The action plan resulting from a review of the military health system has garnered interest from some Members of Congress. The initial Senate bill aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics, with estimated costs of $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill is presumed to be less demanding and costly without the provisions of the initial Senate Section 711. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) is estimated to require about $95 million over 2016-2020 to meet health quality metric requirements.
