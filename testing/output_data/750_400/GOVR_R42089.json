    "content": "Residential energy efficiency benefits consumers by reducing utility bills and supports national environmental goals by decreasing the demand for fossil fuel-generated electricity. Various policies, including tax incentives, have been implemented since the 1970s to promote conservation and energy efficiency. The challenge lies in determining the most effective policy tools for achieving energy efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was used for residential purposes. In the 1970s, tax incentives were implemented to promote energy efficiency. The federal government is still deciding on the best policy tools for energy efficiency goals. In 2016, one-fifth of US energy consumption was from residential sectors, which has slightly decreased in recent years. In recent years, residential energy consumption in the United States has slightly decreased as a percentage of all energy consumption. Per capita residential energy use has also shown modest declines, indicating possible efficiency gains. Residential energy use per capita in the United States has remained relatively constant since the 1970s, with a downward trend starting in the mid- to late-2000s. Efficiency gains have helped keep aggregate residential energy use flat or slightly declining, despite the increasing use of energy-demanding technologies. Experts believe there is still significant potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector. Despite gains in energy efficiency, experts believe there is still significant potential for increased efficiency in the residential sector. Concerns remain that consumers may not invest optimally in energy efficiency, leading to debates about the level of investment needed. Increasing energy efficiency could potentially reduce residential energy use per capita over time, but population growth may offset these gains. Increasing energy efficiency in the residential sector could lead to reduced energy use per capita over time, but population growth may counteract these gains. One policy option to promote residential energy efficiency is through tax credits. The report provides an overview of current residential energy-efficiency tax credits. The report explores the use of tax credits to promote residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers in the sector. The report discusses the economic rationale for residential energy-efficiency tax incentives to address market failures and barriers in the sector. It outlines how tax incentives correct these issues and provides an economic analysis of primary tax incentives for residential energy efficiency. For the 2017 tax year, taxpayers can claim tax credits for residential energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy technologies. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit allows credits for building envelope improvements and high-efficiency heating, cooling, and water-heating systems. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit (IRC \u00a725C) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements to their primary residence's building envelope and high-efficiency heating, cooling, and water-heating appliances. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of each energy-efficient property capped at a specific amount. The Section 25C tax credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for energy-efficient improvements to their primary residence, including building envelope upgrades and high-efficiency appliances. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of each energy-efficient property, capped at $500. Taxpayers often claim the maximum credit amount for energy-efficient property purchases. The Section 25C tax credit for energy-efficient property is capped at $500, and if claimed before 2017, it cannot be claimed again in 2017 as the credit expired at the end of that year. Eligibility requirements for residential energy-efficiency tax credits in 2017 are summarized in Table 1. The Section 25C tax credit for energy-efficient property is capped at $500 and cannot be claimed in 2017 if previously claimed before that year as the credit expired. The residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D) allows taxpayers to claim a 30% credit for installing renewable energy technologies on their residence. The Section 25D tax credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for installing renewable energy technologies on their residence. The credit rate is 30% for 2017 and will decrease to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after that year. The maximum value of the credit is not capped. The Section 25D tax credit for renewable energy technologies decreases from 30% in 2017 to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after that year. The maximum value of the credit is uncapped. For more details, refer to the appendices. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. However, some consumers do not make these investments. See Appendices for more details on energy-efficiency property specifications and legislative history. Consumers may not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency due to market failures related to energy production and consumption. This phenomenon is known as the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories may help explain why consumers do not invest in the optimal amount of residential energy efficiency. Market failures related to energy production and consumption, along with market barriers, contribute to the lack of investments in energy-efficient technologies. The Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not directly address these issues. Market failures and barriers hinder optimal investments in residential energy efficiency. Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not fully address these issues, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Consumers may not make optimal investments due to externalities, principal-agent problems, and capital market imperfections. Market failures and market barriers, including externalities and informational issues, may limit optimal investments in residential energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities can lead to underallocation of resources for energy-efficiency investment. Energy consumption externalities, such as pollution costs, may explain suboptimal investment in residential energy efficiency due to market imperfections. Consumers do not pay the full cost of electricity consumption if prices do not reflect negative environmental consequences. Residential electricity consumption may lead to negative environmental externalities like pollution costs. If electricity prices do not account for these consequences, consumers do not pay the full cost, resulting in overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can have positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects. The adoption of energy-efficient technologies can lead to positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. This occurs when individuals learn about and are more likely to adopt new technologies after seeing them in use by others. The adoption of new solar panel technology on a home can lead to knowledge spillover effects, encouraging neighbors to adopt the technology as well. This benefits society as a whole, as markets often fail to consider these spillover effects. The principal-agent problem can also arise when there is a disconnect between those making energy-efficient purchasing decisions and the ultimate energy consumer. The principal-agent problem can occur when there is a disconnect between incentives for energy-efficient property purchasing decisions and the ultimate energy consumer. For example, landlords may underinvest in energy efficiency in non-owner-occupied housing, leading to market failures in technology adoption. Capital market imperfections may lead households to underinvest in energy efficiency, as landlords and builders may not invest optimally without knowing the energy use patterns of tenants or homebuyers. Low-income households may settle for less energy-efficient property due to capital market imperfections and credit constraints. This can lead to suboptimal energy efficiency investments by landlords and builders. Initial high costs of energy efficiency investments may deter purchasers from opting for more efficient alternatives. Low-income households may opt for less energy-efficient options due to financial constraints, leading to suboptimal energy efficiency investments. Lack of upfront funds can result in purchasing cheaper, less efficient alternatives. Limited access to credit may also contribute to settling for less energy-efficient choices. Additionally, lack of information about energy-saving technologies can hinder consumers from making informed investment decisions. Consumers may settle for less energy-efficient options when unable to borrow upfront cash or lack information about energy-saving technologies. Uncertainty about future energy prices can also deter investments in energy efficiency. Government policies like tax incentives can help address market failures or barriers. Consumers may hesitate to make energy-efficient purchases due to uncertainty about future energy prices. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help overcome market failures or barriers. Other policy options like grants, rebates, or credit enhancements could also be considered. The government can address energy market failures through regulations or mandates and support energy efficiency investments with informational programs like Energy Star. Tax credits such as Section 25C and Section 25D can help correct negative externalities associated with residential energy consumption. The government can use regulations, mandates, and tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D to address energy market failures and promote energy efficiency investments. Other tax incentives, such as the expired IRC \u00a745M credit, can reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D are used to lower the cost of energy-efficiency investments, encouraging additional investment in these technologies. Other incentives, such as the expired IRC \u00a745M credit, reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Tax credits incentivize energy-efficiency investments and can lower technology costs. They promote awareness and address positive externalities. However, they may not be the most efficient option if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices. The Energy Star labeling program and other information programs can increase awareness about technologies. Tax credits may not be the most efficient policy option for increasing energy-efficiency investment if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices. It would be more efficient to allow electricity prices to fully reflect electricity costs by removing federal financial support for electricity. Increasing energy-efficiency investment can be more efficient by allowing electricity prices to fully reflect electricity costs, which would encourage increased investment in energy-efficiency technologies. This can be achieved by removing federal financial support for electricity or taxing electricity production that generates external costs not currently reflected in market prices. Increasing the price of electricity to reflect full costs would promote investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters. Most current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not directly address the principal-agent problem. Section 25C and Section 25D credits are not available to renters, discouraging investment in energy efficiency. Landlords also do not benefit from these credits for rental property investments. Other incentives like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes more effectively tackle potential principal-agent issues in the market. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, such as Section 25D, do not benefit landlords or renters. Other incentives, like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, address principal-agent problems more effectively. However, these tax incentives may have limited impact on overcoming capital market imperfections for homeowners who struggle to secure credit for upfront costs of energy-efficient technologies. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively help homeowners facing credit constraints to pay for upfront costs of energy-efficient technologies. In cases where consumers lack information about these technologies, additional information may not fully address the market failure. Subsidies for efficiency could be a more effective policy option for immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Tax credits may not be the best policy for immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidies for energy efficiency could be more effective in increasing adoption of technologies and societal welfare. However, for well-informed consumers, tax credits may not be necessary to encourage adoption. Recent research suggests that tax credits for energy efficiency may decrease total welfare for well-informed consumers, as they may not need the incentive to invest in energy-efficient technologies. Tax credits are most beneficial when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. According to recent research, tax credits for energy efficiency may not be necessary for well-informed consumers and could instead provide windfall gains. These credits are most effective when targeting consumers with significant energy inefficiencies. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits aim to promote investment in residential energy-efficient property but may not address all market failures to maximize energy-efficient technology usage. Tax credits for energy efficiency in existing homes may not fully address market failures to increase usage of energy-efficient technologies. An economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits evaluates their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues. The effectiveness of tax incentives in promoting desired behavior is unclear in the case of residential energy efficiency benefits. Tax credits for energy efficiency in existing homes, specifically Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits, are being evaluated for their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues. It is uncertain how effective these tax credits are in encouraging additional investment, as they may mainly reward consumers who would have made investments regardless. These credits also tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers, raising equity concerns. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has identified potential administrative issues. Residential energy tax credits aim to promote energy-efficient investments, but their effectiveness in driving additional investment is unclear. These credits often benefit higher-income taxpayers and face administrative issues, as highlighted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has identified administrative issues with current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency. The goal of residential energy-efficiency tax credits is to encourage individuals to increase investments in energy efficiency. Tax credits should lead consumers to make energy-efficient investments, not just reward them for investments they would have made anyway. Tax policies are successful if tax credits lead to additional residential energy-efficiency investment. However, if tax credits only reward consumers for investments they would have made anyway, the policy goal is not achieved. Credits that reward consumers without encouraging additional energy-efficiency investments do not result in economy-wide energy-efficiency investment or reduced energy consumption. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investments or reduced energy consumption, as concerns were raised in the 1970s when these credits were first introduced. Members of Congress expressed reservations about the effectiveness of these tax credits in hearings on President Carter's proposals. Representative Bill voiced concerns during one of these hearings in 1979. In 1979, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of residential energy tax credits introduced in the 1970s. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed reservations during House Ways and Means hearings on President Carter's proposals to expand these benefits. He noted that the tax credits did not provide the expected marketplace incentive and had a lower impact on the Treasury than anticipated. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed concerns about the inefficiency of tax credits, noting that they did not provide the expected marketplace incentive and had a lower impact on the Treasury than anticipated. He highlighted that the tax credits tended to be a reward for economic actions forced by other factors, rather than a motivator. The tax credit does not act as a motivator but rather occurs at the end of the year as a reward for economic actions forced by other factors. Empirical evidence on residential energy tax credits in the late 1970s and early 1980s is mixed, with some researchers suggesting they led to additional investment in energy-efficiency property while others believe they resulted in windfall gains for credit recipients. The impact of residential energy tax credits on purchasing decisions is uncertain. Some researchers suggest they lead to additional investment in energy-efficient property, while others believe they result in windfall gains for credit recipients. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Residential energy tax credits may not significantly impact purchasing decisions for consumers investing in energy-efficiency improvements due to other market incentives like high energy prices. Federal revenue losses from tax credits could be seen as windfall gains for some consumers. Consumers investing in residential energy-efficiency improvements may not be significantly influenced by tax credits due to other market incentives like high energy prices. The savings from tax credits are only realized when tax returns are filed, reducing the incentive power of the credit for some taxpayers. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not provide a current financial incentive for some taxpayers who have no federal income tax liability. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency mainly benefit higher-income taxpayers with income tax liability. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers with tax liability, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient equipment like heating and cooling property through tax credits. This can encourage consumers to make more efficient choices and upgrade their equipment even before it becomes inoperable. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency target higher-income taxpayers to invest in energy-efficient equipment like heating and cooling property through tax credits, encouraging efficient choices and upgrades. The purpose is to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency aim to incentivize higher-income homeowners to invest in energy-efficient equipment, promoting efficient choices and upgrades. These incentives target individuals and households making energy property investments. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency are aimed at higher-income homeowners, with the majority of claims coming from taxpayers with an adjusted gross income above $50,000 in 2015. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers, with over three-quarters of claims in 2015 coming from tax units with adjusted gross income above $50,000. In 2015, tax units with incomes above $50,000 claimed 89.0% of residential energy tax credits, receiving credits approximately seven times higher than those with incomes below $50,000. The nonrefundability feature of these tax credits may limit eligibility. Tax units with higher incomes claim the majority of residential energy tax credits, receiving credits seven times higher than lower-income units. Nonrefundable tax credits like Section 25C and 25D may limit eligibility based on tax liability. Section 25D credits can be carried forward, but Section 25C credits cannot. Tax credits like Section 25C and 25D may limit eligibility based on tax liability. Section 25D credits can be carried forward, but Section 25C credits cannot. Taxpayers without sufficient tax liability in the current year may not fully benefit from the Section 25C credit. Eliminating tax liability through other incentives may prevent taxpayers from benefiting from certain residential energy-efficiency incentives. Taxpayers with low tax liability in the current year may not fully benefit from Section 25C credit for residential energy efficiency. This limitation affects those who use other tax incentives to eliminate their tax liability, such as credits for the working poor, child-related incentives, and education benefits. The focus on higher-income taxpayers for energy-efficiency incentives may undermine the goal of motivating energy-efficient investments through tax credits. Energy-efficiency tax incentives are often limited to higher-income taxpayers, which may hinder the goal of using tax credits to promote energy-efficient investments. If tax credits are only available to wealthier households, who are less likely to be credit constrained, they may not effectively address the barrier of high up-front costs for energy-efficiency property investments. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with. Tax credits reducing costs may encourage investment, but if only available to higher-income households, they may not effectively address market barriers. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with, as low compliance costs increase the likelihood of claiming tax benefits. Burdensome filing processes may deter eligible taxpayers from claiming benefits and responding to incentives. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits in April 2011. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported in April 2011 that there were opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits through the tax code. The IRS was unable to verify if individuals claiming these credits had actually made qualifying energy modifications to their homes. The IRS could not verify if individuals claiming residential energy tax credits made qualifying modifications to their homes or if they were eligible for the credits. Taxpayers were not required to provide information about their residences or third-party verification of expenses. Claimants of residential energy tax credits do not need to provide information about their residences or third-party verification of expenses. Prior to 2011, IRS Form 5695 did not confirm eligibility for these credits, leading to uncertainty about homeownership status for 30% of claimants. The IRS Form 5695 did not confirm eligibility for residential energy tax credits before 2011, leading to uncertainty about homeownership status for 30% of claimants. The form was updated in 2011 to request additional information about the taxpayer's home. The IRS updated Form 5695 in 2011 to request additional information about the taxpayer's home for claiming residential energy tax credits. TIGTA found that almost 800 eligible taxpayers were incorrectly denied $1.5 million in credits. The 25C credit is limited to $500, while the 25D credit has no monetary limit but cannot exceed the taxpayer's tax liability. The IRS may have wrongly denied nearly 800 eligible taxpayers around $1.5 million in residential energy tax credits. The $500 limit to the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, resulting in taxpayers being improperly denied the full credit amount. Congress has the option to let these tax credits expire as scheduled. The 25C credit limit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, resulting in taxpayers being denied the full credit amount. Congress has the option to let these tax credits expire as scheduled or consider other policy options for future incentives for residential energy efficiency. The Section 25C credit expired in 2017 and the Section 25D credit will expire in 2021. Congress may consider modifying or replacing these credits with a grant program. Letting the credits expire as scheduled may impact taxpayers' purchasing decisions. The Section 25C credit expired in 2017 and the Section 25D credit will expire in 2021. Letting the credits expire as scheduled may impact taxpayers' purchasing decisions. Policymakers may choose to extend, expand, or modify residential energy-efficiency tax incentives. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, which have undergone changes since 2005, may be extended, expanded, or modified by policymakers. Extending the credit with a $500-per-taxpayer cap in place would provide limited incentives for additional investment for homeowners who have already claimed tax credits under Section 25C. These credits can be expanded in various ways to encourage more investment. The residential energy efficiency tax credits, added in 2005, have seen changes. Extending the credit with a $500-per-taxpayer cap may not provide sufficient incentives for homeowners who have already claimed credits. Expanding the credits by using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps could encourage more purchases. Expanding residential energy efficiency tax credits by using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps could provide additional incentives for taxpayers. The value of these credits grew nearly five times between 2007 and 2009. Policymakers could scale back these provisions by reinstating technology-specific caps. Expanding residential energy efficiency tax credits by removing caps and including more technologies could provide additional incentives for taxpayers. Policymakers may scale back these provisions by reinstating technology-specific caps or introducing an overall cap, potentially causing confusion for taxpayers estimating their credits. Reinstating technology-specific caps or introducing an overall cap for residential energy efficiency tax credits may cause confusion for taxpayers estimating their credits. Policymakers could also consider phasing out these credits for upper-income taxpayers to reduce budgetary costs. Policymakers may consider phasing out energy efficiency tax credits for upper-income taxpayers to reduce budgetary costs. They could also replace these credits with a rebate program or alternative mechanism for direct cash payments to incentivize energy-efficient purchases. This approach may be more effective in encouraging consumers to invest in renewable energy technologies. Policymakers may consider replacing energy efficiency tax credits with a rebate program or direct cash payments to incentivize purchases for consumers, especially those with limited funds or little tax liability. This alternative approach could be more effective in promoting investments in renewable energy technologies. See Appendix C for more details on the budgetary effects of these provisions. A rebate program called Home Star was proposed in 2010 to incentivize the installation of energy-efficient property for consumers with limited funds or little tax liability. The program aimed to provide direct financial benefits to contractors and promote investments in renewable energy technologies. In 2010, legislation was introduced for a rebate program called Home Star to incentivize energy-efficient property installation. The House passed the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act, but the Senate did not consider it. Appendices provide details on property eligibility for tax credits and legislative history. The legislation Home Star, passed by the House in 2010, was not considered by the Senate. Appendices detail property eligibility for tax credits and the legislative history of residential energy efficiency incentives. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and allowed to expire in the mid-1980s. Present-day residential energy tax incentives, introduced in 2005, are similar to those from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation, with two components totaling a maximum credit value of $300. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation. It had two components: one for energy-conservation expenditures and another for solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The maximum credit value was $2,500. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation, with a maximum value of $2,500. In 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act increased the credit amount for renewable energy expenditures to a maximum of $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 and was not reinstated until 2005. The Profit Tax Act of 1980 increased the renewable energy credit to 40% of the first $10,000 of expenditures, with a maximum value of $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 and was not reinstated until 2005 under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency improvements in 2006 and 2007. Taxpayers could receive a nonrefundable credit of 10% of qualified expenditures under Section 25C. Under EPACT05, taxpayers were eligible for a nonrefundable tax credit equal to 10% of qualified expenditures for residential energy efficiency improvements in 2006 and 2007. Specific property-specific credit limits were set for various types of property, such as advanced main air circulating fans, furnaces, heat pumps, and water heaters. The Section 25C credit had specific credit limits for different types of property improvements, with a maximum lifetime cap of $500 for 2006 and 2007. The credit could only be applied to the taxpayer's principal residence. Another credit established by EPACT05 was the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) for the same years. The Section 25C credit for windows in 2006 and 2007 had a $200 cap, with a lifetime limit of $500. It could only be used for improvements on the taxpayer's main home. Another credit for those years was the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), offering a 30% nonrefundable credit for qualified photovoltaic, solar water-heating, and fuel-cell properties. The residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) offered a 30% nonrefundable credit for qualified photovoltaic, solar water-heating, and fuel-cell properties. The credit had annual limits, with photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties capped at $2,000 per year and fuel cells at $500 per year. Expenditures on qualifying properties were limited to the taxpayer's residences, with fuel-cell expenditures restricted to the taxpayer's principal residence. At the end of 2007, Section 25C expired, while Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 clarified that all property using solar energy to generate electricity could qualify for the Section 25D credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year, expanding the list of qualified energy property to include biomass fuel stoves eligible for a $300 credit. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from eligibility. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year, expanding the list of qualified energy property to include biomass fuel stoves eligible for a $300 credit. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from eligibility under Section 25C but added to the list under Section 25D, which was extended for eight years through 2016 with modifications and expansions for existing and new technologies. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Section 25D tax credit for eight years, through 2016, and included geothermal heat pumps as eligible property. The act also removed the $2,000 maximum annual credit limit for solar-electric property expenditures starting in 2009, expanded the credit to include small wind-energy property, and increased the credit for small wind energy to 30% of expenditures. The tax credit for qualified solar-electric property expenditures was extended through 2016 by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. It removed the $2,000 annual credit limit and expanded the credit to include small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump property. The credit for small wind energy was 30% of expenditures up to $4,000 annually, while the credit for geothermal heat pumps was 30% of expenditures up to $2,000 annually. The tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal properties were extended and modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Taxpayers could receive a credit of 30% of expenditures up to $4,000 annually for wind turbines and up to $2,000 annually for geothermal heat pumps. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal properties. The Section 25C credit was extended for two years, with the credit now equal to 30% of qualified expenditures for energy-efficiency improvements. The aggregate credit cap was raised to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. ARRA extended the Section 25C credit for two years (2009 and 2010), increasing the credit to 30% of qualified expenditures for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The credit cap was raised to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010, with the removal of the $200 cap for windows. Taxpayers could claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. The aggregate cap for windows was eliminated for 2009 and 2010, allowing taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows. ARRA also reduced efficiency standards and removed maximum credit caps for most technologies under the Section 25D tax credit for 2009 and 2010. Under ARRA, the efficiency standards for energy improvements and property were reduced, expanding the credit availability. Changes to the Section 25D tax credit removed maximum credit caps for most technologies in 2009 and 2010. This led to an increase in the number and total amount of credits claimed, with higher average credit amounts compared to previous years. Following changes made under ARRA to tax credits in Section 25C and Section 25D, the number and total amount of credits claimed increased. Average credit amounts were higher during this period. However, when the ARRA expansions expired, the number of taxpayers claiming the residential energy credit decreased, along with the total and average amount of credits. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but with reinstated lifetime limits of $500 and $200. The Section 25C credit was extended through 2011 with reinstated lifetime limits of $500 and $200. Taxpayers who had already claimed these credits in previous years were ineligible to claim them again in 2011. Additionally, efficiency standards were restored to prior levels. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the Section 25C credit for two more years, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act reinstated technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the Section 25C credit for two additional years, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act reinstated technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property. Additionally, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act extended and modified the 25C credit for 2015 and 2016. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended the Section 25C credit for one additional year in 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended and modified the 25C credit for 2015 and 2016, requiring windows and doors to meet Energy Star 6.0 standards. The PATH Act extended the 25C credit for 2015 and 2016, requiring windows and doors to meet Energy Star 6.0 standards. Division P of P.L. 114-113 extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021 and modified the credit formula. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021 and modified under Division P of P.L. 114-113. The credit formula for solar technologies will be extended for five additional years, from 2017 to 2021, with a 30% calculation of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021. The credit will be calculated as 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, then decrease to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017. In 2020, the solar technology credit formula will be 26% of qualifying expenditures, decreasing to 22% in 2021.
