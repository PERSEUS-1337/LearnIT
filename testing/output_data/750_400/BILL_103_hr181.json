    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for individuals who become eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B) to have their primary insurance amount computed with an additional transitional increase amount. The primary insurance amount for individuals under paragraph (4)(B) of Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act includes a transitional increase amount calculated based on the excess under former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year of eligibility for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits in different years is as follows: 1979 - 60 percent, 1980 - 35 percent, 1981 - 30 percent, 1982 - 25 percent, 1983 - 10 percent. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and the amount that would be their primary insurance amount if calculated under the current section. The term 'excess under former law' means the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and the amount that would be their primary insurance amount if calculated under the current section.

The primary insurance amount is determined based on specific calendar years after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) until age 61, plus 3 additional years with the highest wages. This paragraph applies to individuals only. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on specific calendar years after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) until age 61, plus 3 additional years with the highest wages.

The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits in December 1987. The primary insurance amount under title II of the Social Security Act will be increased for months before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is necessary for individuals receiving monthly insurance benefits in December 1987 based on specific criteria.
