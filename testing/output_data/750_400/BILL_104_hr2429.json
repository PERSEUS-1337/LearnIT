    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for agricultural producers to maintain prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as outlined in Section 2 of the Act. Congress recognizes the conversion of such farmland to nonagricultural uses due to the lack of competitive options for retaining it in agricultural production. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands as states and local governments have not been able to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production on these lands. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands by providing cost-sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements under the Farms for the Future Act of 1990. The term 'qualifying farmland' refers to land used for agriculture deemed important by a State or local agency due to its agricultural, economic, or environmental value and at risk of being converted to incompatible uses. A 'farmland protection easement' is an easement related to farmland protection. The term 'farmland protection easement' refers to an easement that restricts land use incompatible with agriculture and binds all future landowners. The term 'farmland protection easement' refers to an easement that restricts land use incompatible with agriculture, binds all future landowners, and is part of a program in eligible States approved by the Secretary to acquire farmland protection easements. In addition, the Secretary may implement a matching grant program to assist eligible States in retaining qualifying farmland for agricultural use. The Secretary may implement a matching grant program for eligible States to acquire farmland protection easements, protecting land from non-agricultural uses. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements to preserve agricultural land or develop similar programs. Grants are typically on a 50-50 matching basis, but can be up to 90 percent for states actively working on these initiatives. Matching grants under subsection (c) are typically on a 50-50 basis, but can be up to 90 percent for states actively protecting farmland. An eligible State cannot receive more than 10 percent of the total amount available for grants in a fiscal year. The government is actively developing programs to protect farmland from incompatible uses. An eligible State cannot receive more than 10% of the total grant amount available in a fiscal year. The Secretary must ensure funds are used appropriately. The Secretary ensures that funds provided to eligible States are used to protect farmland, with priority given to lands important to the State's agriculture industry. The purchase price of farmland protection easements acquired using these funds should not exceed fair market value.
