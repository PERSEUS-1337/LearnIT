    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and the government's own accounts, including trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Government surpluses or deficits determine changes in public debt, while on-budget fiscal balance does not directly affect debt held in government accounts. The government's surpluses or deficits determine changes in debt held by the public, while debt held in government accounts is influenced by net financial flows and government accounting practices. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has increased borrowing from the public every year. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has consistently increased borrowing from the public every year, except in FY1969 and the period FY1998-FY2001. Government accounts' debt levels are affected by net financial flows and accounting practices, with increases or decreases in debt held by these accounts resulting from various factors such as the Social Security Trust Fund. The government's persistent budget deficits have necessitated issuing more debt to the public. The federal government has consistently increased borrowing from the public every year, except in FY1969 and the period FY1998-FY2001. The accumulation of Social Security and other trust funds led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit, requiring Congress to raise the debt limit periodically. Issues with the debt limit since the Budget Control Act of 2011 are discussed in more detail in CRS Report. The Greenspan Commission's recommendations led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit, requiring Congress to periodically raise the debt limit. Issues with the debt limit since the Budget Control Act of 2011 are discussed in more detail in CRS Report R43389. Treasury's financing methods can be constrained when federal debt nears its legal limit due to fluctuating government income and outlays. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's financing methods can be hindered when federal debt approaches its legal limit, impacting government income and outlays. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing cash flow, especially as government trust fund accounts can fluctuate between deficits and surpluses monthly. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is essential for managing cash flow, especially when federal debt nears its legal limit. This can complicate financial management when government revenues and outlays fluctuate, impacting the level of debt throughout the year. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing cash flow during fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. If the debt limit restricts borrowing, the government may struggle to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner. If outlays exceed revenues, the government may not meet legal obligations on time due to the debt limit restricting new debt issuance. This could lead to difficulties in paying bills and investing surpluses in federal debt as required by law, causing a sustained inability to pay obligations on time. The Treasury may face challenges in meeting legal obligations on time due to the debt limit, potentially hindering its ability to borrow on advantageous terms in the future. Delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs, risking default on interest payments on Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow on advantageous terms in the future could be hindered if obligations are not paid on time. Delays in debt limit increases may lead to serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs, risking default on interest payments on Treasury securities. Default could be avoided by delaying other federal payments and transfers. Delaying payments to avoid default on securities can have serious negative repercussions for economies and financial markets worldwide. This can lead to interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Several credit ratings agencies and investment banks have expressed concerns about the consequences to the financial system and the economy if the U.S. Treasury were unable to fund federal obligations. Many economists and financial institutions have stated that if the market associated Treasury securities with delayed payments, it could have serious negative repercussions. The government may face interest penalties for delayed tax refunds. Concerns have been raised by credit agencies and banks about the impact on the financial system if the U.S. Treasury cannot meet federal obligations. Economists warn of global market effects if Treasury securities are seen as risky. Past Treasury Secretaries have used strategies like suspending debt sales to manage debt during debt ceiling constraints. If the market perceives Treasury securities as risky, it could have significant effects on global capital markets. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt during debt ceiling constraints, such as suspending debt sales and withholding certain government trust fund receipts. Congress has authorized the Treasury Secretary to use these strategies, including invoking a \"debt issuance suspension period\" using specific government funds. The U.S. Treasury has used special strategies to manage cash and debt during debt ceiling constraints, including postponing or downsizing debt auctions and withholding certain government trust fund receipts. Congress authorized the Treasury Secretary to invoke a \"debt issuance suspension period\" using specific government funds. These actions have expanded options available to the Treasury Secretary, but would have minor effects on delaying when federal debt reaches its legal limit. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities acquired in 2008 at a pace of $10 billion per month to minimize market disruptions. As of March 2012, the Treasury's MBS portfolio has been eliminated. Proceeds from other asset sales are unlikely to prevent reaching the legal debt limit. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities acquired in 2008 at a pace of $10 billion per month to minimize market disruptions. As of March 2012, the Treasury's MBS portfolio has been eliminated. Other asset sales are unlikely to prevent reaching the legal debt limit. The U.S. Treasury's asset sales may not sustain smooth debt management due to the imbalance between federal revenues and outlays. Alternative asset sales are deemed impractical. Suggestions to use the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit have been rejected by President Obama and legal experts. The Fourteenth Amendment's Section 4 has been suggested as a way for the President to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama and legal analysts have rejected this idea. The debt limit can impede the Treasury's ability to manage the government's finances, leading to the need for extraordinary measures when the federal debt nears its limit. The debt ceiling constraints can hinder the Treasury's financial management, requiring extraordinary measures when the federal debt nears its limit. While it has not caused default, it has led to inconvenience and uncertainty in Treasury operations. Congress uses the debt limit to control spending and assert its constitutional prerogatives. The debt limit has caused inconvenience and uncertainty in Treasury operations but has never led to default. Congress uses it to control spending and assert its constitutional prerogatives, imposing fiscal accountability on the government. The debt limit imposes fiscal accountability on the government by requiring visible action to allow further federal borrowing when spending exceeds revenues. Some experts argue that the debt limit is outdated and does little to alter spending and revenue policies. The debt limit is debated among budget experts, with some advocating for its elimination due to the controls provided by the congressional budget process. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval, while others argue that the debt limit provides a different leverage for controlling federal spending. Congress typically delegates work to its committees. The Obama Administration proposes allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval, providing a different leverage for controlling federal spending. Congress delegates work to its committees, with Committees on Appropriations handling discretionary spending, authorizing committees managing mandatory program spending, and Committees on the Budget drafting an overall budgetary framework. The Committees on Appropriations handle discretionary spending, authorizing committees manage mandatory program spending decisions, and Committees on the Budget draft an overall budgetary framework specifying federal spending and taxation levels. Measures involving the debt limit provide individual Members with a separate instrument to influence federal fiscal policy. Congress has always placed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional authority. Between World War I and World War II, Congress evolved statutory restrictions on federal debt into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all outstanding federal debt. This helped Congress assert its constitutional powers of the purse, taxation, and war initiation. During World War I and World War II, Congress imposed aggregate limits on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Before World War I, borrowing was authorized for specific purposes like the Panama Canal, with Congress specifying details of debt instruments. In times of war, Congress gave the Treasury discretion within broad limits to choose debt instruments. During times of war, Congress granted the Treasury discretion to choose debt instruments within broad limits for specific purposes like the construction of the Panama Canal. Concerns were raised about the impact on monetary policies, but proponents argued that federal borrowing would not disrupt previous monetary agreements. These concerns became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve. The Treasury Secretary was granted authority to issue debt instruments during times of war, with concerns raised about the impact on monetary policies. Proponents argued that federal borrowing would not disrupt previous monetary agreements, which became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to issue certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management, as well as long-term bonds. Treasury Secretary was authorized to have $100 million in short-term certificates and $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds. The Spanish-American War costs were funded through the issuance of certificates of indebtedness and longer-term notes and bonds. The certificates were mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions, while the notes and bonds were available for public subscription, allowing smaller investors to participate. The Treasury Secretary was granted administrative leeway within certain limits, which tended to expand over time. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 allowed smaller investors to participate in financing the United States' entry into World War I by dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. The act also incorporated unused borrowing capacity from previous acts, while retaining separate limits for previous debt issues. The Bond Act of 1917, which financed the US entry into World War I, removed limits on bond maturity and redemption. It also included unused borrowing capacity from previous acts and retained separate limits for previous debt issues. Subsequent borrowing measures were amendments to the Second Liberty Bond Act until 1982. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 removed limits on bond maturity and redemption, allowing for additional borrowing capacity from previous acts. Amendments to this act were used for subsequent borrowing measures until 1982. Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with leeway to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues in the 1920s. In the 1920s, Congress gave Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon more flexibility to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues. They allowed Treasury to issue notes and limited the amount outstanding, giving greater flexibility to roll over debt. Savings certificates for small investors were also reintroduced. In the 1930s, Congress moved towards aggregate constraints on federal borrowing, allowing the Treasury more flexibility. In the 1930s, Congress implemented aggregate constraints on federal borrowing, giving the Treasury more flexibility in financial management. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the need for orderly and economical management of public debt. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds to manage public debt more efficiently. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of orderly financial management. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau later called for a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds in 1935. In 1931, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury more flexibility in issuing bonds. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau proposed replacing a limit on bond issuance with a limit on outstanding bonds in 1935. This change highlighted the role of Treasury bonds in managing federal finances. Congress then set limits of $20 billion on shorter-term debt and $25 billion on outstanding bonds. President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested this change in March 1939. In 1931, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury more flexibility in issuing bonds, and in 1935, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau proposed a limit on outstanding bonds instead of bond issuance. Congress then set limits of $20 billion on shorter-term debt and $25 billion on outstanding bonds. President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested further changes in March 1939, leading to the approval of the measure (H.R. 5748) by the House and Senate. The House approved measure H.R. 5748 on March 23, 1939, creating a $45 billion aggregate limit on public debt, combining limits on bonds and shorter-term debt. President Roosevelt signed the law (P.L. 76-201) on July 20, allowing Treasury to roll over maturing notes into longer-term bonds. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the law (P.L. 76-201) on July 20, 1939, creating the first aggregate limit of $45 billion on public debt. This allowed the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively by combining a $30 billion limit on bonds with a $15 billion limit on shorter-term debt. Additionally, a separate $4 billion limit for \"National Defense\" series securities was introduced in 1940. The Treasury was given more flexibility in managing federal debt by combining shorter-term debt limits with longer-term bonds. Legislation in 1941 increased the aggregate debt limit to $65 billion, folding the separate limit for \"National Defense\" series securities back under it. This greater independence came on the eve of the US entry into World War II, with the debt limit closer to total federal debt than after World War I. In 1940, legislation increased the aggregate debt limit to $65 billion, combining borrowing authority for \"National Defense\" series securities. The debt limit was closer to total federal debt on the eve of World War II compared to after World War I. The debt limit was raised during World War I and World War II to accommodate increasing costs, reaching $300 billion by 1945. After World War II, the limit was reduced to $275 billion, remaining unchanged until 1954 due to the Korean War being financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. After World War II, the debt limit was reduced to $275 billion. The limit remained unchanged until 1954 due to the Korean War being financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Eisenhower Administration requested an increase in 1953, but Congress only approved a temporary increase in August 1954. Congress declined to raise the limit until February 1958 to compel more economy and efficiency. In 1953, the Eisenhower Administration requested a debt limit increase, but Congress only approved temporary increases until 1958 to promote better management of money and manpower in defense programs. The debt limit reached $300 billion in 1962, and since then, Congress has made 78 changes to the limit. In March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion, and Congress has enacted 78 measures to alter the limit on federal debt. Recent increases in the debt limit have been significant, such as the $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. During the years of government surpluses, federal debt held by intergovernmental accounts grew by $855 billion. Since FY2001, federal debt has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Debt held by the public has increased, while debt held in government accounts has also grown, partly due to Social Security payroll taxes exceeding beneficiary payments. Since FY2001, federal debt has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Debt held by the public increased by $855 billion, while debt held in government accounts grew as well, mainly because Social Security payroll taxes exceeded beneficiary payments. Table 1 and Figure 1 show the components of federal debt as percentages of GDP from FY1996 to FY2014, with projections through FY2019. Table 2 provides information on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. Federal debt has grown steadily since 1982, with debt held by government accounts increasing due to Social Security tax increases. Debt held by the public grew as a share of GDP through the mid-1990s. Table 2 provides information on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. Since 1982, federal debt has grown steadily, with debt held by government accounts increasing due to Social Security tax hikes. Debt held by the public as a share of GDP increased through the mid-1990s, but deficits shrank after FY1992, leading to surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001. These surpluses, along with rapid GDP growth, reduced debt held by the public. However, large deficits in the early 2000s caused debt held by the public to increase again. The federal government ran surpluses from FY1998 through FY2001, reducing debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP. However, deficits reemerged in FY2002, leading to an increase in debt held by the public. This accumulation of debt added pressure on the debt limit in the early 2000s. In FY2002, accumulating debt in government accounts increased pressure on the debt limit. Surpluses from FY1998-FY2001 reduced debt held by the public, but deficits in FY2002 led to a net increase of $405 billion in total debt subject to limit. By May 2002, debt subject to limit had increased by $217 billion. In FY2002, accumulating debt in government accounts increased pressure on the debt limit, leading to a net increase of $405 billion in total debt subject to limit. By May 2002, debt subject to limit had increased by $217 billion, nearing the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration recognized the deteriorating budget outlook and growth in debt held by government accounts. In FY2002, the government accounts accumulated another $217 billion in debt, bringing the total close to the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion due to the growing debt held by government accounts. In early December 2001, the Administration asked Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion. As the debt approached the limit in FY2002, the Administration repeatedly urged Congress to increase the limit to avoid adverse financial consequences. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury suspended reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan to keep debt below the limit and meet government obligations. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury avoided adverse financial consequences by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan to keep debt below the limit. The debt subject to the limit stood at $5,949,975 million on April 15, just $25 million below the limit. After tax revenues flowed in, the Treasury restored the G-Fund by issuing new debt and crediting the fund with interest. By the end of April, the debt subject to the limit had fallen back $35 million. On April 15, debt subject to limit was $5,949,975 million, just $25 million below the limit. The Treasury restored the G-Fund by issuing new debt and crediting it with interest. By the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen back $35 billion below the limit. By mid-May 2002, debt subject to limit had risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit. Treasury used its authority to avoid default for the second time in 2002. By mid-May 2002, debt subject to limit had again risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit. The Treasury, for the second time in 2002, used its statutory authority to avoid default and asked Congress to raise the debt limit. Treasury's financing problems would persist without an increase in the debt limit. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid default. Without an increase, the Treasury's financing problems would continue. The Treasury announced that the government would exceed the debt ceiling by May 16, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. This period allows the Treasury to suspend or redeem investments in trust funds to fund government operations. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid default by May 16, 2002. A \"debt issuance suspension period\" will begin by that date, allowing the Treasury to suspend investments in trust funds to fund government operations. Treasury actions will suffice until June 28, 2002, but without a debt limit increase by then, further measures will be needed to avoid breaching the limit. The Treasury took extraordinary actions to replace debt instruments held by government accounts, enabling the issuance of new debt to meet obligations until June 28, 2002. Without a debt limit increase by then, the Treasury would need to take further actions to avoid breaching the ceiling. Treasury postponed a securities auction by June 21 but had not taken any other actions yet. With upcoming payments due, the Treasury stated it would soon exhaust all options to fulfill government obligations, putting the government at risk. By June 21, the Treasury had postponed a securities auction but had not taken further actions to avoid breaching the debt ceiling. With large payments due at the end of June and beginning of July, the Treasury stated it would soon exhaust all options to issue debt, risking a government default. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit in May and June 2002. In May and June 2002, Congress took steps to increase the debt limit to avoid a government default. The Senate expressed reluctance to include a debt limit increase in the supplemental appropriation bill, but eventually adopted a bill to raise the debt limit on June 11. The Senate adopted a bill (S. 2578) on June 11 to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion, aiming to provide enough borrowing authority for government operations through the end of 2002 or possibly into 2003. The House later passed the $450 billion debt limit increase. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion, aiming to provide enough borrowing authority for government operations through the end of 2002 or possibly into 2003. The House passed the increase by a single vote on June 27, and the President signed the bill into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. Kenneth Dam, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit by late February 2003. The $450 billion debt limit increase was passed by a single vote on June 27 and signed into law by the President on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. Kenneth Dam, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, requested a further increase in the debt limit by late February 2003 to avoid financial problems. In 2003, the Treasury requested a debt limit increase to avoid financial problems. By February 20, 2003, the Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the limit. In 2002, legislatively mandated measures were used to manage debt holdings of certain government accounts to avoid reaching the debt limit. This included replacing internally held government debt with non-debt instruments and not issuing new debt to these accounts. These actions allowed the Treasury to issue additional debt to the public or other federal accounts. By April 11, 2003, the Treasury held debt $15 million below the debt ceiling. The Treasury issued additional debt to the public to pay for government commitments and raised the debt limit through legislative measures in April 2003. In April 2003, the House triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit with legislation (H.J.Res. 51). The Senate acted in May after Treasury warnings of default, raising the limit to $7,384 billion (P.L. 108-24). In May 2003, the Senate raised the debt limit to $7,384 billion after receiving Treasury warnings of imminent default. The legislation was signed by the President on May 27. In June 2004, the Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid financial disruptions. By October 14, the debt reached $7,383,975 million, just $25 million below the limit. Treasury used methods to keep debt under control. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress about the situation. The Treasury warned Congress in September that the debt limit would be reached in October. By October 14, the debt was just $25 million below the limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's reputation in capital markets and increasing federal borrowing costs. Treasury Secretary John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the debt limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's reputation in capital markets and increasing federal borrowing costs. Without an increase in the debt limit, the Treasury would be unable to meet all existing obligations, as no budget resolution had been passed by Congress. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in 2004 but did not reach a final agreement with the Senate. Without a budget resolution, no measure to raise the debt limit could be passed automatically. As the debt approached the limit, no legislation was moved to raise the debt limit. No legislation was moved to raise the debt limit as the debt approached the limit through the summer and fall. In September 2004, an amendment was added to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations in an effort to remove the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached the existing limit. The House passed the legislation, but the Senate did not act on it. Senator Frist introduced legislation in November 2004 to address the issue. The government faced a financial crisis as federal debt approached the limit. Legislation was introduced to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House in November 2004. The President signed the legislation into law on November 19, 2004. In November 2004, legislation (S. 2986) was introduced to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, from $7,384 billion to $8,184 billion. The Senate and House approved the increase, and the President signed it into law (P.L. 108-415) on November 19, 2004. The Treasury rescheduled a debt auction and invoked a \"debt limit suspension period\" following the increase. The debt limit increase in 2005 allowed the Treasury to reschedule a debt auction and cancel the \"debt limit suspension period.\" Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution. In 2005, Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit, but neither committee reported a bill for the $781 billion increase to $8,965 billion. In 2005, Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. The House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee were directed to report bills, but neither committee did so. The adoption of the conference report on the FY2006 budget resolution triggered the Gephardt rule, resulting in a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) automatically passing the House and sent to the Senate. The adoption of the conference report on the FY2006 budget resolution in late April 2005 triggered the Gephardt rule, leading to the House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) raising the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. The Senate had not considered H.J.Res. 47 by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Treasury Secretary Snow warned Congress in December 2005 that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006. The Senate had not considered H.J.Res. 47 by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Treasury Secretary Snow warned Congress in December 2005 that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006, requesting an increase in the debt limit. In subsequent letters, Snow advised Congress that the Treasury was taking measures to avoid reaching the limit until mid-March. In mid-February 2006, Treasury Secretary Snow requested an increase in the debt limit as the government was close to being unable to meet its obligations. Measures were taken to avoid reaching the limit until mid-March, including declaring a debt issuance suspension period. The Senate passed a debt limit bill on March 16. In mid-February 2006, Treasury Secretary Snow requested an increase in the debt limit to avoid default until mid-March. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, and the President signed it into law on March 20, raising the limit to $8,965 billion. Congress passed the FY2008 budget resolution in mid-May 2007. In March 2006, the Senate passed a debt limit increase to $8,965 billion, which was signed by the President. In May 2007, Congress passed the FY2008 budget resolution. In July 2007, the Treasury requested another debt limit increase to $9,815 billion. The adoption of the conference report on the budget resolution led to the automatic engrossment of a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 43, 110th Congress) raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. The Treasury requested the increase in July 2007, projecting the limit would be reached in early October. Without an increase, the Treasury would take steps to avoid exceeding the debt limit. The Senate Finance Committee approved the resolution without changes. In August 2007, projections suggested the debt limit would be reached in late October or early November. The Senate approved resolution H.J.Res. 43 on September 12, 2007, which was signed by the President on September 29, 2007. Financial markets showed signs of turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious recession that lasted until 2009. The financial crisis of 2008 led to a recession that lasted until 2009, prompting federal actions to stabilize housing and financial markets. The economic slowdown began with a rapid deceleration of housing prices and a rise in interest rate spreads, indicating major financial institutions' reluctance to lend to each other. In 2009, federal actions were taken to stabilize the housing and financial markets in response to the financial crisis and recession. The economic slowdown was marked by a decrease in housing prices and an increase in interest rate spreads, leading to major financial institutions being hesitant to lend. This prompted measures to unfreeze credit markets, boost consumption, and increase spending, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. Federal deficit spending peaked at 9.8% of GDP. The recession led to major actions to unfreeze credit markets, boost consumption, and increase spending. Federal deficit spending spiked to 9.8% of GDP, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. Falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, impacting the economy's recovery. The economic recession led to a spike in federal deficit spending to 9.8% of GDP. This was due to falling asset prices reducing federal revenues, impacting the economy's recovery by decreasing capital gains taxes and corporate taxes, as well as causing a decrease in individual income taxes due to job cuts and rising unemployment. Unemployment insurance and income support programs also paid out more money as unemployment rose. Deficit spending during economic recession impacts federal revenues from taxes and increases federal spending through unemployment insurance and income support programs. Boosting the economy through deficit spending provides a fiscal stimulus, but can also accelerate inflation if output levels are near potential levels. Deficit spending during economic recession impacts federal revenues from taxes and increases federal spending through unemployment insurance and income support programs. Boosting the economy through deficit spending provides a fiscal stimulus if output levels are below potential levels, but can also accelerate inflation if output levels are near or at potential levels, exacerbating long-term fiscal challenges. In March 2008, CBO estimated a $396 billion deficit in FY2008 and a $342 billion deficit in FY2009, but the actual deficit for FY2008 reached $455 billion. In August 2009, CBO estimated a deficit of $1,587 billion in FY2009 and $1,381 billion in FY2010. The federal debt limit was raised twice in the second half of 2008 and twice in 2009 due to the current economic conditions and government actions to bring the economy out of recession. The House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget recommended policies that would result in a $10,200 billion debt in FY2009. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in 2008 and 2009 due to economic conditions and government actions. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions recommended policies resulting in a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion in FY2009, respectively, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The Senate and House Concurrent Resolutions in FY2009 recommended policies leading to a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion, respectively, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The budget conference report passed the Senate and House, resulting in a debt subject to limit of $10,207 billion in FY2009. The budget conference report passed the Senate and House, leading to a debt subject to limit of $10,207 billion in FY2009. The House passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take it up, so the limit remained at $9,815 billion. The House also passed an amended version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The House passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take it up, so the limit remained at $9,815 billion. The House also passed an amended version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which included a debt limit increase to $10,615 billion. The Senate passed the measure on July 26, and the President signed the bill on July 30, increasing the debt limit.

The act also created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to replace OFHEO and FHFB. CBO estimated a 5% chance of a cost to taxpayers of over $100 billion. The FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship on September 7, 2008, giving it full control over their assets and operations. CBO estimated a 5% chance of a cost to taxpayers exceeding $100 billion if intervention was needed to support the two entities. On September 7, 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control over their assets. The federal government acted to stabilize financial markets by deprivatizing the firms and authorizing the Treasury Secretary to buy mortgage-related assets.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law by the President, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Congress considered another economic stimulus measure containing tax cuts and spending increases, which would increase the deficit. The Senate version of ARRA included a provision to raise the debt limit to $12,140 billion, while the House version initially omitted this provision. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. The Senate version included a provision to raise the debt limit to $12,140 billion, while the House version initially omitted this provision.

The budget resolution for FY2010 recommended a debt limit of $13,233 billion, triggering the Gephardt rule and leading to the House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) on April 29, 2009. In August 2009, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner notified Congress that the debt limit would be reached in mid-October. The House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) proposed raising the debt limit by $925 billion to $13,029 billion. Treasury Secretary Geithner warned Congress in August 2009 that the debt limit would be reached in mid-October. The U.S. Treasury later announced it could delay reaching the limit until December by reducing loans through the Supplemental Financing Program. The U.S. Treasury announced it could delay reaching the statutory debt limit by reducing loans through the Supplemental Financing Program from $200 billion to $15 billion, extending the deadline to mid or end of December.

The U.S. Treasury reduced loans through the Supplemental Financing Program from $200 billion to $15 billion to delay reaching the statutory debt limit. The Obama Administration also considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program to lower federal debt subject to the limit. Repayments of TARP funds were being made, which could further reduce the debt subject to the limit. Other measures, such as those taken in 2003, could also extend the Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury was facing challenges in managing its debt limit, with potential issues arising from scheduled nonmarketable securities issuance and interest payments to federal trust funds. Measures like reducing loans and scaling back TARP were considered to address the situation.

The President signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010, after a contentious 2011 debt limit episode. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed by the President on February 12, 2010. Treasury Secretary Geithner announced the federal debt had reached its limit on May 16, 2011, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reinstated caps on discretionary spending and constrained federal spending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner announced the federal debt reached its limit on May 16, 2011, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. The extraordinary measures extended Treasury's borrowing capacity until about August 2, 2011, but funding from these measures may buy less time than in previous debt limit episodes. The U.S. Treasury confirmed its borrowing authority would be exhausted on July 1, 2011, due to the extraordinary measures used to extend its borrowing capacity. However, these measures may provide limited additional time before the federal government is unable to meet its financial obligations, given the size of the FY2011 federal deficit projected to reach $1,399 billion. The U.S. Treasury's borrowing authority would be exhausted on July 1, 2011, due to extraordinary measures used to extend its capacity. Slowing federal debt growth by cutting spending was suggested to avoid increasing the debt limit, but the scale of required reductions would equal total discretionary spending for the last five months of FY2011. On July 15, the Treasury announced its limitations. The U.S. Treasury announced on July 15 that it had suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, one of the last available extraordinary measures before its borrowing authority would be exhausted on August 2. This move was unexpected by analysts, who noted that the Treasury may have less cash headroom than anticipated. On July 15, 2011, the U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a step analysts had not expected until August 1. This move could complicate funding federal operations without a debt limit increase. Treasury cash flows analysis projects $174.4 billion in cash inflows from August 3 to the end of the month. The U.S. Treasury may face challenges in cash management due to a potential lack of headroom. Funding federal operations could become more complicated without a debt limit increase. An analysis of Treasury cash flows projects a shortfall of $134.3 billion from August 3 to the end of the month. Treasury estimates on the debt limit and extraordinary measures have changed since January 6, 2011. Cash inflows of $174.4 billion are projected, $134.3 billion less than outflows of $306.7 billion. Treasury's cash flow projections are uncertain. Estimates on the debt limit and extraordinary measures have shifted since January 6, 2011. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have helped increase headroom between federal debt and its limit. The Treasury Secretary requested a debt limit increase in a letter to Congress on January 6, 2011. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities expanded the headroom between federal debt and its limit. Estimates on reaching the debt limit and extending borrowing capacity through extraordinary measures have been close to Treasury's projections, but are subject to uncertainties in federal spending patterns and cash flow. The Treasury Secretary's estimates on reaching the debt limit and extending borrowing capacity through extraordinary measures have been close to projections. A letter to Congress dated May 2, 2011, indicated a potential debt issuance suspension period on May 16 unless action was taken, allowing measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. The Treasury Secretary planned to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, 2011, unless Congress acted earlier. Extraordinary measures were in place to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011, including drawing down the Supplementary Financing Program from $200 billion to $5 billion. New issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. The Treasury Secretary took measures to manage monetary policy by drawing down the Supplementary Financing Program from $200 billion to $5 billion. New issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, anticipating reaching the statutory limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. The Treasury Secretary suspended new issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities on May 6, 2011. He requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, predicting reaching the statutory limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. Despite projections that federal debt would reach its limit by May 31, 2011, a bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The U.S. Treasury estimated federal debt would reach its limit between April 15 and May 31, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The House later passed the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 on July 19, 2011, but the Senate tabled the bill on July 22. The House passed the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 on July 19, 2011, but the Senate tabled the bill on July 22. The bill aimed to increase the federal debt limit to $16,700 billion and required a balanced federal budget. President Obama signed a revised compromise measure into law on August 2, 2011. A balanced federal budget amendment was sent to the states. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid. President Obama signed a revised compromise measure into law on August 2, 2011, which eliminated the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. Obama signed the Budget Control Act (BCA) into law in 2011, eliminating the need for debt limit increases until early 2013. The BCA included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions (sequester), and the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions (sequester), and the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. It also allowed for increases in the debt limit of up to $2.4 trillion under certain conditions. The legislation provided a three-step procedure for raising the debt ceiling. The Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions, and the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. It allowed for increases in the debt limit of up to $2.4 trillion under certain conditions, with a three-step procedure for raising the debt ceiling. The legislation also provided for expedited consideration of recommendations, a vote on a proposed constitutional amendment for a balanced federal budget, and a mechanism for the President and Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling, subject to congressional disapproval. The debt limit was increased in a three-step procedure. The first increase of $400 billion occurred on August 2, 2011, followed by a $500 billion increase on September 22, 2011. The second increase was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, which was rejected by the Senate on September 8, 2011. The debt limit was increased in three steps: $400 billion on August 2, 2011, $500 billion on September 22, 2011, and a third increase of $1.2 trillion triggered by a provision in late December 2011. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure on September 8, 2011, and the House passed a disapproval measure, but the Senate did not act on it. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, prompting a third increase of $1.2 trillion. The President delayed the request for this increase to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. This increase could have also been triggered by a debt limit increase of $1.5 trillion or if the states had received a balanced budget amendment for ratification. The debt limit increase of $1.2 trillion was delayed by the President to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. Another potential increase of $1.5 trillion could have been triggered if the states had ratified a balanced budget amendment. Additionally, recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction could have led to an increase between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion. The House failed to ratify a budget amendment (H.J.Res. 2) to increase the debt limit by $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction could have also recommended an increase, but they were unable to agree on a set of recommendations. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, also known as the Super Committee, was unable to agree on recommendations for deficit reduction. As a result, the debt limit was increased by $1.2 trillion to match budget reductions planned through sequestration over the FY2013-FY2021 period. This summarizes debt limit policy developments after 2011. The debt limit was increased by $1.2 trillion to match budget reductions planned through sequestration over the FY2013-FY2021 period. Treasury Secretary Geithner invoked extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until mid-February to mid-March 2013. The debt limit was increased through the Budget Control Act to meet federal obligations until early 2013. The House passed a measure to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, which was later signed into law. This allowed the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used to meet obligations. The House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, allowing the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used for federal payments. The Senate and President signed the measure into law (P.L. 113-3) on February 4, 2013. After the suspension lapsed, the debt limit was reset to $16,699 billion on May 20, 2013. After the debt limit suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit to $16,699 billion, $305 billion higher than before. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013, allowing the use of extraordinary measures.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013, triggering authorities that allow the Treasury Secretary to use extraordinary measures. Secretary Lew notified Congress that the debt subject to limit was just $25 million below the limit and sent updated forecasts on the expected date of borrowing capacity exhaustion, which was pushed back due to stronger revenue collections and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After the debt limit suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit to $16,699 billion. Secretary Lew notified Congress of the expected exhaustion of borrowing capacity by October 17, 2013, which was later extended due to increased revenue collections and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, to end the federal government shutdown. The U.S. Treasury expected to exhaust its borrowing capacity by October 17, 2013. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, to end the federal government shutdown and suspended the debt limit until February 8, 2014. After the suspension ended on February 7, 2014, the debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. The debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion after the suspension expired on March 16, 2015.

The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. The debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion after the suspension expired on March 16, 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked authorities for a debt issuance suspension period until July 30, 2015. On March 16, 2015, the debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion, and Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to meet financial obligations until the end of October 2015. Secretary Lew indicated that these measures would provide additional time beyond October to meet federal financial obligations. Secretary Lew sent a letter to congressional leaders invoking extraordinary powers until the end of October, allowing the U.S. Treasury to meet financial obligations for a brief period after October. He stated that these measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Secretary Lew announced on October 15, 2015, that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a cash reserve of less than $30 billion. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected, leading to earlier exhaustion of measures. Initial estimates projected meeting federal obligations until November or early December 2015, but more recent estimates in September 2015 moved that date closer to mid-November 2015. The \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues including the debt limit. The agreement reset the debt limit to March 16, 2017, reflecting federal obligations payment. The \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, reset the debt limit to March 16, 2017, reflecting federal obligations payment and increasing statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) reset the debt limit to March 16, 2017, and increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The agreement also included measures to offset these spending increases. The House and Senate approved the modified version of the bill, which was signed into law by the President on November 2, 2015 (P.L. 114-74). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) reset the debt limit to March 16, 2017, and increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 through FY2001, reducing its debt. Projections in early 2001 showed large surpluses and rapid debt reduction, with concerns about retiring all federal debt held by the public. The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 through FY2001, reducing its debt. Projections in early 2001 showed large surpluses and rapid debt reduction, with concerns about consequences of retiring all federal debt held by the public. The short span of surpluses turned to deficits due to increased military and security spending after September 11, 2001, and rising nondefense outlays in areas such as education and veterans' care. The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 through FY2001, reducing its debt. However, the short span of surpluses turned to deficits due to increased military and security spending after September 11, 2001, rising nondefense outlays, and tax reductions in 2001 and 2003. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent economic recession led to large federal deficits, necessitating a series of debt limit increases. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession caused large federal deficits, leading to debt limit increases. Fiscal issues have become less prominent since the 2011 debt limit episode. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 led to large federal deficits and debt limit increases. The direct fiscal costs of a financial crisis are overshadowed by the effects of diminished tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. Despite concerns about fiscal sustainability in 2011, federal deficits have decreased as the economy has recovered. For example, the FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. Federal health program costs and net interest expenses have also risen less rapidly than expected. However, major changes are still needed over the next decade. Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, federal deficits have decreased as the economy has recovered. The FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. Despite this improvement, without major policy changes, persistent deficits could substantially increase federal debt, leading to slower economic growth in the long run. CBO has warned that the current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable. Without major changes in federal policies, persistent deficits could substantially increase federal debt over the next decade. CBO has been warning for years that the current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable and could lead to slower economic growth as debt rises as a percentage of GDP. Congress may need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing federal debt to meet financial obligations. Data on federal debt and changes in amounts are provided in Table A-1 since September 2001. Unless federal policies change, Congress would repeatedly face demands to raise the debt limit to accommodate the growing federal debt in order to meet financial obligations. Data on federal debt and changes in amounts are provided in Table A-1 since September 2001. Since September 2001, federal debt has increased significantly, with total federal debt rising by $12,380 billion, debt held in government accounts increasing by $2,566 billion, and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. This growth in debt has led to periodic reductions in the debt limit. Since the end of FY2001, total federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Debt measures experienced periodic reductions despite an overall increasing trend."
