    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the ESA categorizes species as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on their risk of extinction. Once listed, the ESA offers legal tools to aid in species recovery and habitat protection, including prohibiting unpermitted \"take.\" The Endangered Species Act (ESA) categorizes species as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk. Legal tools include prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" and ensuring actions don't harm listed species or critical habitat. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and requires agencies to ensure actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 species listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States and its territories. 1,156 U.S. species have recovery plans. The ESA was enacted in 1973. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 species listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States. 1,156 U.S. species have recovery plans. Funding authorization under the ESA expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds each year. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. Funding authorization under the ESA expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds each year. The ESA aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species, despite funding challenges. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) remains in effect regardless of appropriations, aiming to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. The ESA can become a battleground in debates over scarce resources, with economic interests at play. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) focuses on allocating scarce resources, with economic interests at play. Declining species signal resource scarcities and ecosystem changes, leading to controversies like the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest. Declining species are often indicators of resource scarcities and ecosystem changes, leading to controversies such as the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest. The global climate change debate, with issues like fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions, is exemplified by the polar bear. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked tensions over species protection, economic growth, and human population impacts. Both Congress and the executive branch have worked to tailor the ESA for specific circumstances amidst increasing species listings. The global climate change debate, represented by the polar bear, includes concerns about fossil fuels, carbon emissions, and melting glaciers. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked tensions over species protection amidst increasing species listings. Congress and the executive branch have sought to tailor the ESA for specific circumstances. Debate on the ESA splits largely along demographic lines. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked tensions over species protection amidst increasing species listings. Critics argue that the ESA and administrative efforts do not do enough to accommodate needs other than species conservation, while defenders believe it balances a bias towards development in other laws and policies. Support for species conservation varies among demographic groups, with stronger support in urban and suburban areas and weaker support in rural areas, as well as differences between coastal and central/mountain states. Sport hunters and anglers are divided on the issue, while Native Americans, who often depend on natural resources, have varying perspectives. ESA splits largely along demographic lines, with stronger support for species conservation in urban and suburban areas compared to rural areas. Coastal regions show more support than central and mountain states. Sport hunters and anglers are divided on the issue, while Native Americans, who rely on natural resources, often support the survival of listed species. Groups opposing strong protections for listed species argue about potential job losses, while those seeking strong protections claim the opposite. Native Americans, often dependent on natural resources like fish, are involved in ESA issues and support the survival of listed species. The debate on ESA often revolves around job loss concerns, with both sides claiming ethical support for their positions. Religious groups also participate in the debate, with industries like logging and land development viewing the ESA as a problem. Some commercial fishing sectors and many others have different perspectives. The debate on ESA often centers on job loss concerns, with both sides claiming ethical support. Religious groups and industries like logging view the ESA differently. The ESA contains statutory authority for certain activities and provisions for appropriations. The ESA contains statutory authority for certain activities and a provision authorizing appropriations through FY1992. Questions are raised about the act's prohibitions and authorities, as well as House and Senate rules concerning appropriations in the absence of current authorization. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) contains provisions for appropriations through FY1992. Questions arise about the act's current effect, House and Senate rules for appropriations without authorization, and the impact of not funding agencies like FWS and NMFS to carry out ESA responsibilities. Authorization for appropriations expired in FY1992, leading to debates on the ESA's current authorization status. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) expired in FY1992, leading to debates on its current authorization status. Despite the lack of current authorization, agencies like FWS and NMFS still have authority to enforce ESA provisions even without appropriated funds. Despite the expiration of the Endangered Species Act in FY1992, agencies like FWS and NMFS still have authority to enforce ESA provisions as the statutory obligations created by the law remain enforceable. The lack of current authorization does not diminish the agencies' ability to conduct actions or enforce prohibitions within the act. The expiration of the Endangered Species Act in FY1992 does not affect the statutory obligations created by the law. The lack of appropriations does not end government obligations, and citizens can still file civil suits for violations of the act, regardless of agency funding. Despite the expiration of the Endangered Species Act in FY1992, government obligations created by the law remain. Citizens can still file civil suits for violations of the act under Section 11(g) (16 U.S.C. \u00a71540(g)), even if agencies lack funding. This could deter parties from carrying out prohibited acts. Both the House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations. Despite the expiration of the Endangered Species Act in FY1992, government obligations remain. Citizen suits can still be filed for violations of the act, even if agencies lack funding, potentially deterring prohibited acts. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, but this does not affect a measure's statutory force when enacted into law. House rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, allowing for separate consideration of legislation. This distinction does not impact a measure's legal force when enacted. Either chamber can choose to waive its rules during the legislative process. House Rule XXI prohibits unauthorized appropriations in measures or amendments, while Rule XXII prohibits unauthorized appropriations in conference reports. Additionally, appropriations are prohibited in legislation not reported by the Committee on Appropriations. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. The Rules Committee can set procedural parameters for appropriations measures. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules and points of order. This must be adopted before considering the measure or conference report. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules and points of order. This must be adopted before considering the measure or conference report. Special rules can waive points of order against provisions in a conference report on an appropriations measure. Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations and prohibit unauthorized appropriations in both committee and floor amendments, except in specified circumstances. This rule is enforced via points of order during consideration. The Senate rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments. This rule is enforced via points of order, but can be waived by unanimous consent. A lapse in funding would have mixed effects on supporters and critics of existing law, impacting various areas during the period of the lapse. During consideration, the application of a lapse in funding may be waived by unanimous consent. The practical effects of the lapse would impact various areas, such as interagency consultations for agency actions and species listings. No interagency consultations for agency actions, no incidental take statements, no species listed or delisted, no critical habitat designated, no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions, and reduced inspections of incoming cargo for violations. No critical habitat designated, potentially increasing lawsuits when Services fail to meet deadlines; No issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions; No or reduced inspections of incoming cargo for violations of species listed under CITES; No fulfillment of other obligations under CITES; No monitoring of candidate species; No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. No critical habitat designated, potentially increasing lawsuits when Services fail to meet deadlines; No issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions; Reduced inspections of incoming cargo for violations of species listed under CITES; No fulfillment of other obligations under CITES; No monitoring of candidate species; No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. The 104th Congress made a major effort to end all funding for the ESA, aiming to eliminate conflicts in projects related to listed species and critical habitat. However, key consequences would include no acquisition of habitat, no state grants for conservation, and no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions. The 104th Congress made a major effort to end all funding for the ESA, aiming to eliminate conflicts in projects related to listed species and critical habitat. However, key consequences would include no acquisition of habitat, no state grants for conservation, and no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions. The ESA's goal of species recovery may determine its necessity for protection in the future. The effort to end funding for the ESA was abandoned due to various effects. The ESA's goal is species recovery to the point where protection is no longer needed. Only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, while others have become extinct or delisted for other reasons. The ESA has been criticized for only delisting 34 species due to recovery, with some becoming extinct or delisted for other reasons. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are truly extinct. Rare species listed as endangered may be difficult to prove as extinct, such as the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew. Confirming the extinction of such species is challenging due to their rarity. Rare species like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew are listed as endangered, but confirming their extinction is challenging due to their rarity. The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act could be measured by the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if they are not delisted. The Endangered Species Act's effectiveness can be measured by the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if they are not delisted. Some species like red wolves and California condors might not exist without ESA protection, showing its impact on preventing extinction. The ESA has been successful in improving or stabilizing the population levels of 41% of listed species. Species like red wolves and California condors owe their existence to ESA protection, preventing their extinction. Some rare species, such as certain salmon populations, Florida panthers, and plants with narrow ranges, may have further declined without the ESA. The ESA has been successful in improving or stabilizing the population levels of 41% of listed species. Some species like red wolves and California condors owe their existence to ESA protection. Without the ESA, certain salmon populations, Florida panthers, and plants with narrow ranges might have declined further towards extinction. Scientific information and analysis are crucial for ESA actions and enforcement, focusing on causes of extinction, normal extinction rates, and comparing current rates to background levels. The ESA has prevented further decline towards extinction for many species. Scientific information is essential for ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction and comparing current rates to background levels. The extinction debate has shifted to include a majority of species beyond well-known animals. Until the mid-20th century, the focus of the extinction debate was on losses due to over-exploitation, generally through hunting, trapping, or fishing. The poster species were passenger pigeons, tigers, wolves, and other well-known animals. However, a shift occurred in the 20th century, with the majority of species now at risk due to habitat loss, including tall-grass prairie, wetlands, old growth forests, rivers, coral reefs, and sandy beaches. Habitat loss, exacerbated by factors like global climate change and the introduction of nonnative invasive species, is a significant threat to many species. This includes habitats such as tall-grass prairies, wetlands, old growth forests, rivers, coral reefs, and sandy beaches. Global climate change, nonnative invasive species, and the homogenization of flora and fauna are major factors contributing to habitat loss and the demise of many species. Invasive species can act as disease vectors, predators, or competitors, further threatening biodiversity. The global decline of species is influenced by various factors such as climate change, invasive species acting as disease vectors, predators, or competitors, leading to the homogenization of flora and fauna. Extinction is a natural process, but the current rate is concerning, with many species threatened by multiple factors and declining for unknown reasons. Geological evidence supports the fact that the majority of species that have existed on Earth are now extinct. Many species are threatened by multiple factors, leading to declines for unknown reasons. Extinction is a natural process, but the current rate is concerning. Geological evidence shows that the majority of species that have existed on Earth are now extinct. The current rate of extinction exceeds background rates, but estimating total species numbers is challenging. The current rate of extinction is a concern as it exceeds background rates. Estimating total species numbers is challenging, with estimates ranging from 3.5 million to 100 million. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates, with 17,000 species per year being a typical estimate. The public is generally unaware of the vast number of species in groups like beetles, marine invertebrates, and fish. The extinction rates are currently higher than normal, with estimates ranging from 100 to 10,000 times the background rates of 1 to 10 species per 10 million species per year. The public is often unaware of the vast number of species in groups like beetles, marine invertebrates, and fish. Current extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than normal background rates of 1 to 10 species per 10 million species per year. Critics mainly question these calculations due to uncertainties in each step of the process. Extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than normal background rates, similar to past extinction events. Critics question these calculations due to uncertainties in estimating the number of existing species. However, most biologists argue that similar results are found in studies across different groups and methods, which are considered scientifically sound. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be brought back. Some biologists argue that despite uncertainties in estimating species numbers, consistent results across different studies are considered scientifically sound. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be revived, but evolution may lead to the emergence of new species better adapted to changing conditions. The time frame for such replacement or recovery is uncertain. Some scientists estimate that recovery to approximately equal numbers of different species after major extinction events took up to 25 million years. If the current extinction rate and recovery rate are comparable to past rates, the return to species numbers of the pre-historic era would take at least 25 million years. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range, and threatened species as those likely to become endangered. Recovery to pre-historic species numbers after major extinction events could take several million years if current extinction and recovery rates are similar to past rates. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered and threatened species based on their risk of extinction. The ESA does not use a numerical standard to account for the wide variety of species biology. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) does not rely on a numerical standard to determine endangered species, as it considers the wide variety of species biology. The protection under the ESA extends to all species and subspecies of animals, with additional protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments. Limited protection is also available for plant species, but not for organisms like Eubacteria or viruses. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harassment, harm, hunting, and capturing. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments. Limited protection is available for plant species under the ESA, but not for organisms like Eubacteria or viruses. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harassment, harm, hunting, and capturing. Controversy exists over whether habitat modification may be considered a form of harm under the ESA, with a 1995 Supreme Court decision supporting its inclusion if it results in the killing or injuring of wildlife. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines \"take\" as including harm, hunting, and capturing, with controversy surrounding whether habitat modification constitutes harm. A 1995 Supreme Court decision supported including significant habitat modification if it results in wildlife injury or death. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. The Endangered Species Act defines \"take\" as harm, hunting, and capturing. The Secretary of the Interior manages listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish are under the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. Species can be listed by the Secretary or by petition, based on scientific evidence. The Endangered Species Act allows species to be listed by the Secretary of the Interior or through petition. The decision to list a species is based on scientific and commercial information, with a focus on public participation and relevant data collection. Economic effects are not considered at this stage, but are part of the critical habitat designation process. The Secretary lists species based on scientific and commercial information, with public participation. Economic effects are not considered in listing decisions, as Congress intended it to be a scientific question of species endangerment. Species can be designated as endangered or threatened. The critical habitat determination under the ESA is based on scientific factors, with economic considerations expressly forbidden. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened depending on the severity of decline and threats to survival. Endangered species are at risk of extinction, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) categorizes species as either endangered or threatened based on the severity of decline and threats to survival. Endangered species are at risk of extinction, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA provides different levels of protection to species, subspecies, or distinct population segments. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" varies. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) categorizes species as endangered or threatened based on decline and threats. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" varies, allowing for different levels of protection. The Department of the Interior (DOI) once defined endangered species as those at risk of extinction throughout their entire range. The Department of the Interior (DOI) previously interpreted the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range\" to mean a species must be endangered throughout its entire range. However, this interpretation was found to violate the ESA by multiple courts. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if the species is not currently endangered or threatened throughout its entire range. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial for preventing extinction throughout its range. The interpretation defines a species' range as its current habitat, not historical. The interpretation defines a species' range as its current habitat, not historical, and states that a portion's contribution to the species' viability is crucial for preventing extinction throughout its range. Listing determinations for endangered or threatened species must be based on scientific factors and threats to continuance. The determination of whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened must be based on scientific factors and threats to its continuance. The ESA specifies that listing determinations are to be made \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available,\" without considering potential economic impacts. This decision process has been likened to diagnosing a potentially fatal disease in a patient. The 1982 amendments to the ESA added the word \"solely\" to clarify that listing a species as endangered or threatened should be based on scientific data without considering economic impacts. This decision process is compared to diagnosing a disease in a patient. The 1982 amendments to the Endangered Species Act added the word \"solely\" to ensure that decisions regarding listing or delisting of species are based strictly on biological criteria. The legislation requires the Secretary to base determinations solely on the best scientific and commercial data available, similar to diagnosing a disease in a patient. The 1982 amendments to the Endangered Species Act added the word \"solely\" to ensure that decisions regarding listing or delisting of species are based strictly on biological criteria, removing non-biological considerations. Economic factors are deemed irrelevant in determining the status of species. The 1982 amendments to the Endangered Species Act added the word \"solely\" to ensure that decisions regarding listing or delisting of species are based strictly on biological criteria, removing non-biological considerations. Economic factors are deemed irrelevant in determining the status of species. The Committee strongly believes that economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species. Applying economic criteria to the analysis of listing alternatives is specifically rejected by the inclusion of the word \"solely\" in the legislation. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that listing species should be based solely on biological criteria, excluding economic factors. The decision of whether a species is endangered or threatened is a scientific one, and economic considerations should not influence it. However, conservation methods can be chosen to minimize costs to society, industry, or landowners after the scientific determination is made. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that species listing is based solely on biological criteria, excluding economic factors. Conservation methods can be chosen to minimize costs after the scientific determination is made. Species listings can be initiated by petition, with the option to change status or delist subject to standards and deadlines. The Endangered Species Act allows for species listings based on biological criteria, with conservation methods chosen to minimize costs. Listings can be initiated by petition, with the option to change status or delist subject to standards and deadlines. Interested parties can file petitions, which must be assessed within 90 days for scientific or commercial merit. If warranted, the agency has 12 months to take action. Lawsuits have been brought challenging the Endangered Species Act's process for determining whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened. The Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to make an initial determination within 90 days of receiving a petition, assessing if there is substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing may be warranted. If so, the agency has 12 months to conduct a status review and decide on listing. If listing is warranted but precluded by higher priority species, it must be reevaluated annually. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with more than 100 for listing. Lawsuits have been settled in 2011, setting deadlines for listing determinations on hundreds of species. The federal government faces lawsuits for not meeting deadlines on ESA listing determinations. Over 160 petitions have been received by FWS, with more than 100 for listing. The responsibility towards species proposed for listing but not yet listed is questioned due to significant delays between proposal and actual listing. The federal government is facing lawsuits for not meeting deadlines on ESA listing determinations. Over 160 petitions have been received by FWS, with more than 100 for listing. Questions arise about the responsibilities towards species proposed for listing but not yet listed, due to significant delays between proposal and actual listing. Federal agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary before taking any action that could harm a species proposed for listing or its critical habitat. The conference process aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning stage and is separate from the consultation process. The conference process is designed to assist federal agencies and applicants in identifying and resolving conflicts early in the planning stage for species proposed for listing. It is less formal than the consultation process for listed species and allows FWS or NMFS to advise on minimizing adverse effects. The agency may choose a more formal process to avoid duplication of effort later. The conference process for species proposed for listing is less formal than the consultation process for listed species. It allows FWS or NMFS to advise on minimizing adverse effects. The agency may opt for a more formal process to prevent duplication of effort later. The ESA states that the conference stage does not require a limitation on irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. The ESA conference stage does not limit irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. Agencies must consider avoiding harm to species and potential liability. For example, avoiding timber sales in areas with proposed species. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent harm and liability. Candidate species are those being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species. During this stage, agencies may choose to avoid certain actions to protect these species. Candidate species are those being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and landowners may enter into conservation agreements to improve the species' status and prevent listing proposals in the future. Federal agencies and entities can work on improving a species' status to avoid future listing proposals. They can develop candidate conservation agreements (CCA) with FWS or NMFS. Nonfederal landowners can also pursue candidate conservation agreements with assurances (CCAA), where they agree to take actions to conserve a species with the assurance that no changes will be required if the species is listed as threatened or endangered in the future. Under a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA), a landowner may agree to carry out actions to improve species conservation with the assurance that no changes will be required if the species is listed as threatened or endangered. The Secretary must publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register, notify state agencies and counties, invite comments, and notify foreign countries if practical. The Secretary must publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register for species proposed for listing under the ESA. This includes notifying state agencies, inviting comments, notifying foreign countries if practical, and holding public hearings. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing. Federal agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions that may jeopardize the species' existence. The Secretary must publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register for species proposed for listing under the ESA. This includes notifying state agencies, inviting comments, notifying foreign countries if practical, and holding public hearings. Federal agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions likely to jeopardize the continued existence of candidate species. In the interval between a proposal and a listing decision, the Secretary must monitor the status of a candidate species and promptly list it if any emergency poses a significant risk to the species. The Secretary can skip some steps in the normal listing process for emergency listings. Special regulations may be created to conserve threatened species, with tailored protections and recovery measures for species like the northern long-eared bat and polar bear. The Secretary can skip steps in the normal listing process for emergency listings and may promulgate special regulations to conserve threatened species. Protections and recovery measures for threatened species can be tailored to specific situations, as seen with the northern long-eared bat and polar bear. A federal regulation clarifies that threatened species without a special rule enjoy the same protections as endangered species. A distinct population segment (DPS) refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species. A federal regulation clarifies that a threatened species without a special rule enjoys the same protections as endangered species. A distinct population segment (DPS) under the ESA refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species, with criteria for designation including discreteness and significance based on genetic diversity loss. The DPS designation under the ESA requires populations to be discrete and significant in genetic diversity loss. If a DPS is threatened, special rules may be applied. The gray wolf DPS designations have faced legal challenges, with courts vacating each designation since 2003. The DPS designation under the ESA requires populations to be discrete and significant in genetic diversity loss. If a DPS is threatened, special rules may be applied. The gray wolf DPS designations have faced legal challenges, with courts vacating each designation since 2003. One court decision criticized FWS for not correctly using the DPS process when creating a DPS and removing its protection simultaneously. NMFS introduced ESUs to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. ESUs typically encompass multiple populations. The ESU concept, developed by NMFS, includes multiple populations of salmon and steelhead trout along the Pacific coast listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. Section 3(16) of the ESA defines ESUs as important groups of salmon populations. As of July 25, 2016, 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout along the Pacific coast were listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The ESU concept was created by NMFS for policy and scientific reasons to address the impracticality of using stock or species levels due to the vast number of distinct stocks and populations. The ESU concept was created by NMFS for policy and scientific reasons to address the impracticality of using stock or species levels due to the vast number of distinct stocks and populations. The question of whether hatchery fish may be assigned to an ESU, thereby augmenting an ESU's population count, has been particularly controversial. In 1982, Congress added the concept of experimental populations to the ESA to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. Two criteria must be met for reintroduction: authorization by the service and geographic separation from other animals of the same species. The ESA added experimental populations in 1982 to reintroduce species without land use restrictions. Two criteria are needed for reintroduction: authorization by the service and geographic separation from other animals of the same species. The experimental population's protected status is determined differently from a DPS or other species, with an essential designation if in imminent danger of extinction. Currently, no experimental populations are designated as essential. Congress required the separation of experimental populations for clear distinction. Protected status is determined differently from DPS or other species, with essential designation if in imminent danger of extinction. Special regulations under ESA Section 4 apply, including rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is required unless the population is in a national wildlife refuge or park. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA apply to experimental populations, with rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is needed unless the population is in a national wildlife refuge or park. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential experimental populations. Delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species follows the same processes as listing. The process for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants is the same as the listing process. Delisting removes a species from the lists, downlisting reclassifies a species from endangered to threatened, and uplisting is the reverse. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate a change in the status of listed species or review the species' status after receiving a substantive petition for any change in listing status. The process of delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species involves reclassifying its status based on scientific data, without considering economic impacts. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate these changes or review a species' status after receiving a petition. Additionally, a review of listed species is required every five years. The determination to delist, uplist, or downlist a species must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic impacts. A review of listed species is required every five years to determine if changes in status are necessary. The Secretary must review listed species every five years to decide on delisting, uplisting, or downlisting based on scientific data. Critical habitat designation is required for listed species, including areas beyond their current habitat if essential for conservation. Designation may be postponed if it could harm the species. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, or 47.5% of the 1,596 listed domestic animal and plant species. The Secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat if it would harm the species, or postpone designation for up to one year if the information is not determinable. Eventually, critical habitat is to be designated for all species, except in cases where it would not be prudent. The Secretary may postpone critical habitat designation for up to one year if information is not determinable. Critical habitat is to be designated for all species, except in cases where it would not be prudent. Any area, federally owned or not, can be designated as critical habitat, impacting private land only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid adverse modification of critical habitat. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for all species, considering scientific data and economic impacts. Federal agencies must avoid adverse modification of critical habitat, impacting private land only if federal action is involved. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat if deemed necessary. The Secretary must designate critical habitat based on scientific data and economic impacts. Areas may be excluded if benefits outweigh inclusion, unless extinction risk is present. The Secretary may exclude habitat from critical designation if benefits outweigh inclusion, but extinction risk must be considered based on scientific data. Economic factors must be taken into account for critical habitat designation. \"Although economic factors are not considered in listing a species as endangered, they must be considered for critical habitat designation. Some habitat areas may be excluded based on economic concerns, but extinction risk must be evaluated. Adverse modification of critical habitat is mainly a concern for federal agencies, while private land use restrictions primarily stem from the ESA's prohibition on taking listed species.\" The Endangered Species Act focuses on protecting listed species and their habitats. Private land use restrictions primarily stem from the prohibition on taking listed species, with critical habitat designation mainly affecting federal agencies. The ESA imposes fewer restrictions on the nonfederal taking of listed plants compared to listed animals. The Endangered Species Act imposes restrictions on taking listed species, with critical habitat designation mainly affecting federal agencies. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation. The Endangered Species Act amended to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation, considering national security and military training impacts. The Endangered Species Act was amended to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation, taking national security and military training impacts into consideration. This change was made in response to concerns that critical habitat designation on military lands was affecting training and readiness activities. Administrations and Congress have supported restrictions on critical habitat designation under the ESA for over 20 years through the appropriations process. The greatest conservation benefit of critical habitat designation is seen when it includes areas not currently occupied by the species. FWS has faced restrictions on designating critical habitat under the ESA for over 20 years. Critical habitat designation is most beneficial when it includes unoccupied areas that serve as connecting corridors or potential reintroduction sites. In 1999, FWS deprioritized critical habitat designation due to budget constraints. In 1999, FWS deprioritized critical habitat designation due to budget constraints, leading to funding restrictions on designating critical habitat areas for over 20 years. The FWS deprioritized critical habitat designation in 1999 due to budget constraints, leading to funding restrictions on designating critical habitat areas for over 20 years. Conservation groups criticized the agency for not requesting increased funds for listing and placing a cap on funding for critical habitat designation. Despite frequent lawsuits for failing to designate critical habitat, the agency maintains that it offers little additional protection beyond the listing process. The FWS has faced lawsuits for not designating critical habitat, but argues that it offers little extra protection beyond listing. The agency believes critical habitat requirements are a poor use of budget resources, especially if the public sees it as the main regulatory impact of the ESA. The designation of critical habitat may provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions, but the FWS argues that it offers little extra benefit beyond listing and is a poor use of budget resources. The FWS argues that designated critical habitat does not provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions, as the jeopardy consideration would already offer necessary protection. The FWS previously disagreed that designated critical habitat provides extra protection for listed species in federal actions, as the jeopardy consideration already offers necessary protection. This conclusion was based on the regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify,\" which focuses on the survival and recovery of a listed species. After several federal courts of appeal agreed that the FWS regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" improperly shifted the focus from species recovery to survival, the definition was changed in February 2016. The Services issued guidance to discontinue the use of the 1986 definition after the Ninth Circuit's decision. The FWS regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" was changed in February 2016 after federal courts agreed it shifted focus from species recovery to survival. The new definition in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 emphasizes the act's focus on recovery. The 1986 definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" was discontinued in February 2016. The new definition in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 emphasizes the focus on recovery by stating that alterations must diminish the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species. The new definition of destruction or adverse modification in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 focuses on alterations that diminish the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species. Recovery plans are required for listed species, with little detail provided in the ESA and its regulations. The appropriate Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, but the plans lack detail and are not binding on federal agencies. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species, and land may be acquired to conserve endangered and threatened species using funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The hortatory nature of recovery plans for endangered species has been criticized as they are not binding on federal agencies. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans for U.S. species. Land acquisition for conservation purposes can be funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which is primarily derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states in conserving protected species under the ESA. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) can be used for land acquisition, funded primarily by offshore oil and gas leases. The ESA requires cooperation with states to conserve protected species and allows for federal funds to assist in endangered species programs through cooperative agreements. States must provide a 25% matching amount for federal funds, and a fund was created in 1988 for state grants, including land. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants to assist in endangered species programs through cooperative agreements with states. States must provide a 25% matching amount for federal funds, and Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories in FY2016. The fund for state grants under the 1988 ESA amendments requires annual appropriation, with $53.5 million allocated for cooperative activities in FY2016. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment if actions may impact a listed species, based on the best available data. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment (BA) if actions of nonfederal parties that require federal approvals, permits, or funding might adversely affect a listed species. The assessment is based on the best scientific and commercial data available and is used to determine if formal consultation is necessary to ensure actions do not jeopardize endangered or threatened species or modify critical habitat. This consultation process is known as a Section 7 consultation. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat through a Section 7 consultation process. This consultation is initiated by the action agency or the FWS Regional Director/NMFS's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries. If a federal action is mandated by law, a Section 7 consultation is not needed. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat through a Section 7 consultation process. This consultation is usually requested by the action agency or can be initiated by an FWS Regional Director or NMFS's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries. If a federal action is required by law, a Section 7 consultation is not necessary. If the appropriate Secretary determines that an action will not jeopardize a species or modify critical habitat, a biological opinion (BiOp) is issued, along with an incidental take statement outlining terms and conditions for the federal action to proceed safely. The Secretary issues a biological opinion (BiOp) with an incidental take statement if an action does not harm species or critical habitat. If harm is likely, alternatives to avoid harm must be suggested. The BiOp is not explicitly required to be based on the \"best scientific and commercial\" information. The Secretary must suggest alternatives to avoid harm to species if the proposed action jeopardizes listed species or critical habitat. The BiOp is based on the best scientific and commercial data available. The BiOp must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available, as required by implementing regulations. Consultations often result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary is expected to complete consultation within 90 days for federal actions. The BiOp includes a summary of the information on which the opinion is based. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary is to complete consultation within 90 days for federal actions, with the possibility of extension up to 150 days. The consultation for a wholly federal action must be completed within 90 days, with a possible extension to 150 days if agreed upon. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or obtain an exemption. Jeopardy resulting from an agency action must be addressed to avoid penalties. Formal consultation for a proposed agency action may take a year or more. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or apply for an exemption to proceed. Exemptions are only available for actions, not species. If a proposed agency action cannot be avoided and the agency still wants to proceed, they can apply for an exemption. Exemptions are only for actions, not species. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) decides if the action can proceed despite harm to a species, with at least five votes required for approval. The ESC consists of six federal officials, including the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) decides on exemptions for agency actions that may harm a species. It consists of six federal officials and a representative from each affected state, known as the \"God Squad.\" At least five votes are needed for approval, with specific members including the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) decides on exemptions for agency actions that may harm a species. It consists of federal officials and state representatives, known as the \"God Squad.\" The law includes rules and deadlines for applying for exemptions, with stringent criteria for approval. The ESC must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary for national security. Additionally, the President may exempt projects for repairing or replacing facilities in disaster areas. The ESC must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary for national security. The President may also exempt projects for repairing or replacing facilities in disaster areas. To be eligible for an exemption, the federal agency must have carried out consultation processes required under the ESA in good faith. To qualify for an exemption in presidentially declared disaster areas, the federal agency must have conducted consultation processes under the ESA in good faith and made efforts to consider alternatives that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. To qualify for an exemption in presidentially declared disaster areas, the federal agency must have made a reasonable effort to develop modifications or alternatives to the proposed action that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. This includes conducting required biological assessments and refraining from irreversible commitments of resources. The agency must have made efforts to develop modifications or alternatives to the proposed action that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. This includes conducting required biological assessments and refraining from irreversible commitments of resources to ensure the exemption process is meaningful. Additional requirements for an application are outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC will grant an exemption for a project if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and the action is in line with conserving the species or its critical habitat. Additional requirements for an application are outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC will grant an exemption for a project if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and the action is in line with conserving the species or its critical habitat, based on evidence and specific criteria outlined in relevant regulations. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) will grant exemptions for projects if no alternatives exist, benefits outweigh drawbacks, and the action aligns with conserving the species or critical habitat. Special provisions apply in specific instances such as international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. No general provision allows exemptions for other emergency conditions under the ESA. The Endangered Species Committee grants exemptions for projects if no alternatives exist, benefits outweigh drawbacks, and the action aligns with conserving the species or critical habitat. Special provisions apply in specific instances such as international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and could take 280 days, with no general provision for exemptions in other emergency conditions under the ESA. The exemption process for projects under the Endangered Species Committee is complex and could take 280 days. The applicant must fund any required mitigation measures, which last for the life of the action. The exemption applies to the action, not the species, so efforts to recover the species must continue. The challenges faced by potential exemption applicants include funding required mitigation measures for the life of the action, which may last indefinitely depending on the nature of the action. The exemption applies to the action, not the species, so conservation and recovery efforts must continue, potentially shifting the burden elsewhere. This could pose a difficult obstacle for a governor balancing various statutory obligations. The burden of conservation and recovery may shift elsewhere if an exemption from the ESA is granted for an action. This could pose a challenge for a governor balancing various statutory obligations, as other laws may still require conservation efforts. Parties involved may be hesitant to support actions that increase the risk of species extinction. If the benefits of an exemption are minimal, the rewards for successful exemption may not outweigh the risks. The consultation process under the ESA offers federal agencies opportunities to modify their actions to avoid harming species or their habitats while still moving forward. Parties involved may be reluctant to support actions that could lead to species extinction, even if an exemption is granted. If the benefits of an exemption are minimal, the effort to obtain it may not be worthwhile. The consultation process under the ESA allows federal agencies to adjust their actions to protect species and habitats while proceeding with their plans. Agencies are encouraged to consider ESA implications early on to prevent conflicts and the need for exemptions. Private parties may obtain permits for incidental take of listed species without federal involvement. The ESA prompts agencies to consider consequences early on to avoid conflicts and exemptions. Private parties can get permits for incidental take of listed species without federal involvement by submitting a habitat conservation plan. The Endangered Species Act allows permits for \"incidental take\" of species through habitat conservation plans. The process includes showing impacts, steps to minimize and mitigate, funding for mitigation, rejected alternatives, and additional measures as required. Streamlined procedures exist for activities with minimal impacts, while exemptions for raptors and regulations for subsistence activities are specified. Interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts are prohibited, along with controls on trade. The Endangered Species Act allows permits for \"incidental take\" of species through habitat conservation plans, with streamlined procedures for minimal impacts. Provisions include exemptions for raptors, regulations for subsistence activities, and prohibitions on interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts. Controls on trade in parts or products of endangered species are also specified. The Endangered Species Act prohibits various acts related to endangered species, including taking, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully taken species. Threatened species are subject to similar protections as endangered species. The Endangered Species Act prohibits acts related to endangered species, including taking, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully taken species. Threatened species are also protected under similar regulations. The ESA's prohibitions apply broadly to any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Exceptions to these prohibitions are outlined in Sections 9 and 10 of the ESA. The Endangered Species Act prohibits acts related to endangered and threatened species, with exceptions outlined in Sections 9 and 10. Violations may result in civil penalties, unless committed in good faith to protect oneself or others from harm. Section 11 of the ESA states that civil penalties will not apply in certain situations, such as when individuals act in good faith to protect themselves or others from harm by endangered species. Violators of the ESA may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators and those involved in the import/export of wildlife. Criminal charges may also apply for serious violations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) imposes civil penalties for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators and importers/exporters of wildlife. Criminal charges may also apply for serious violations. The ESA allows anyone to bring a lawsuit in federal court to enforce its provisions or compel the Secretary to perform a duty. The ESA allows anyone to bring a lawsuit in federal court to enforce its provisions or compel the Secretary to perform a duty, with the possibility of awarding litigation costs and attorneys' fees. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows citizens to sue to enforce listing-related provisions, with a 60-day notice requirement. Litigation costs and attorneys' fees may be awarded by the court. Citizen suits have driven efforts to conserve species, with some studies showing citizen groups push for listings of species at greater risk than proposed by agencies. The citizen suit provisions of the ESA have been instrumental in driving efforts to conserve species, with studies showing that citizen groups often push for listings of species at greater risk than proposed by agencies. Citizen suits seeking to list species or challenge delays in listing decisions result in a significant number of lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA citizen suit provisions drive conservation efforts by pushing for listings of species at greater risk than proposed by agencies. These suits result in numerous lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States, focusing on protecting species and addressing violations of CITES within U.S. jurisdiction. CITES categorizes listed species based on extinction risk and trade, while the ESA also considers habitat loss. CITES categorizes listed species based on extinction risk and trade, while the ESA focuses on protecting species and addressing violations of CITES within U.S. jurisdiction. The ESA does not control habitat loss like CITES does. The United States committed to nature reserves and controlling international wildlife trade through the Western Hemisphere Convention. The United States, through the Western Hemisphere Convention, committed to establishing nature reserves and controlling international wildlife trade. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority specified under CITES. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority specified under CITES, responsible for ensuring that international trade does not harm endangered species. The Secretary enforces these determinations through FWS, using the best available biological information for export decisions. The Secretary of the Interior, designated as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority under CITES, enforces export determinations to protect endangered species. This authority is exercised through FWS, ensuring legal export and import of specimens under suitable conditions. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, ensures legal export and import of specimens under suitable conditions. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species enhancement. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species in the United States, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species enhancement. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission from the Secretary and keep records to enhance enforcement of trade-related provisions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires importers and exporters of fish or wildlife to obtain permission from the Secretary, keep records, and use designated ports. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) made decisions on exemptions for Grayrocks Dam and the Platte River. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires importers and exporters of fish or wildlife to obtain permission from the Secretary, keep records, and use designated ports. An exemption was granted for Grayrocks Dam by the Endangered Species Committee (ESC) due to the potential impact on the habitat of whooping cranes in the Platte River Basin. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir project in Wyoming, despite concerns about its impact on the habitat of endangered whooping cranes in the Platte River Basin. The exemption was conditioned on specific mitigation measures, including the maintenance and enhancement of critical whooping crane habitat and the establishment of a trust fund to fund these activities. The ESC granted an exemption for Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir on January 23, 1979, with specified mitigation measures for whooping crane habitat. Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition, especially after the listing of the endangered snail darter. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition, especially after the listing of the endangered snail darter. Litigation ensued, leading to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill, which clarified the broad reach of the ESA and its impact on public works projects. This decision prompted the passage of P.L. 95-632, which established an ESC process for project exemptions. The landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the broad reach of the ESA and its impact on public works projects. This led to the passage of P.L. 95-632, which established an ESC process for project exemptions. Congress later directed the completion of the Tellico Dam despite the ESC's denial of an exemption. The ESC denied an exemption for the Tellico Dam, but Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. The ESC granted exemptions for 13 out of 44 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 out of 44 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. Controversy surrounded the sales, leading to their withdrawal in the Clinton Administration. Additionally, there were applications for exemptions for a refinery in Eastport, ME, but no ESC decisions were made. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. Controversy led to the sales being withdrawn in the Clinton Administration. There were also applications for exemptions for a refinery in Eastport, ME, and a docking area for barges, but no ESC decisions were made. The company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, and another company sought to build a docking area for barges at Mound City, IL, but both applications were withdrawn after facing jeopardy opinions and denials of permits. The company applied for an exemption to build a docking area for barges at Mound City, IL, on the Ohio River, which was habitat for an endangered mussel. Despite facing a jeopardy opinion and permit denial by the Army Corps of Engineers, the company withdrew the application in 1986. Similarly, the Suwanee River Authority's consulting engineer applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for the endangered manatee. However, the engineer lacked the authority to apply on behalf of the Authority, leading to the withdrawal of the application in 1986. River Authority applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for the endangered manatee. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers due to the engineer lacking the authority to apply on behalf of the Authority. In 1986, the Authority refused to ratify his actions and withdrew the application, making the withdrawal effective."
