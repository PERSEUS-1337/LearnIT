    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, titled \"Gains from Constructive Ownership Transactions\" under Part IV of subchapter P of chapter 1. The taxpayer's gain from a constructive ownership transaction with a financial position is treated as short-term capital gain if it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. If it is still treated as long-term capital gain, the capital gain rate is determined based on the applicable rates under section 1(h). The determination of capital gain rates for long-term gains is based on applicable rates under section 1(h) after considering the net underlying long-term capital gain. If gain is treated as short-term capital gain, an interest charge may apply on the deferral of gain recognition. The interest charge on deferral of gain recognition applies if short-term capital gain is treated for a taxable year, increasing the taxpayer's tax by the amount of interest that would have been imposed under section 6601. The taxpayer's tax for a taxable year is increased by interest under section 6601 for periods ending on the due date for the return of tax and on underpayments of tax for prior years related to gain recognition.

Additionally, any increase in tax due to this provision is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for determining credits.
