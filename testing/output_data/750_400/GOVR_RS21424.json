    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were deemed economically and technologically impractical to retrofit with the latest pollution control technology. New sources, however, were required to install state-of-the-art controls to prevent new pollution problems. States had discretion to set emission standards for existing major air pollutants under the CAA of 1970. The CAA of 1970 differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. States had discretion to set emission standards for existing major air pollutants, while new sources were required to install state-of-the-art controls to prevent new pollution problems. EPA sets strict technology-based standards for new sources that may endanger public health or welfare. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act gave EPA the authority to set emission standards for new sources of air pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. These standards, known as NSPSs, are technology-based and require the use of the best demonstrated technology to achieve the emissions rate. In areas with cleaner or dirtier air than national standards, major new sources must undergo NSR before construction. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act introduced NSR requirements for new sources of air pollutants in areas with cleaner or dirtier air than national standards. These requirements mandate obtaining pre-construction permits with emission limits based on \"best available control technology\" or \"lowest achievable emission rate.\" The RMRR issue arises due to the need for compliance with these standards. The Clean Air Act introduced NSR requirements for new sources of air pollutants in different areas. Compliance involves obtaining pre-construction permits with emission limits based on specific technologies. The RMRR issue arises from the need to adhere to these standards for both new and modified stationary sources. The Clean Air Act requires compliance with NSPSs and NSR for new and modified stationary sources. NSPSs apply to new sources, while NSR applies to major new sources or modifications of existing sources in PSD and nonattainment areas. The Clean Air Act mandates compliance with NSPSs and NSR for new and modified stationary sources in PSD and nonattainment areas. The key issue is determining what changes to a stationary source constitute a \"modification,\" as defined by any physical change or change in operation that increases air pollutant emissions. The Clean Air Act requires compliance with NSPSs and NSR for new and modified stationary sources in PSD and nonattainment areas. The pivotal issue is defining what changes to a source constitute a \"modification,\" which is any physical change or change in operation that increases air pollutant emissions. The definition determines which changes are subject to NSPSs and trigger NSR. The definition of \"modification\" under the Clean Air Act determines which changes in a source trigger NSPSs and NSR. It includes any physical change or change in operation that increases air pollutant emissions, leading to questions about specific phrases like \"physical change\" and \"change in the method of operation.\" This broad definition has been the subject of litigation due to its implications for NSPSs and NSR compliance. The definition of \"reconstruction\" under the Clean Air Act triggers NSPSs and NSR when an existing facility undergoes significant component replacement exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost of a new facility. EPA's definition of \"reconstruction\" has been the subject of litigation due to its implications for compliance. The EPA defines \"reconstruction\" as the replacement of components in an existing facility exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost of a new facility, triggering NSPSs and NSR. Unlike modifications, a change in a facility can constitute a reconstruction regardless of emission increases. EPA's definition of \"modification\" aligns with the act's definition and outlines six types of changes. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" aligns with the act's definition and outlines six types of changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications. This includes exceptions for maintenance, repair, and reconstruction of components in an existing facility. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" includes exceptions for maintenance, repair, and replacement activities that are routine for a source category. Eligibility for the exemption was previously determined through case-by-case analysis. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" includes exceptions for maintenance, repair, and replacement activities that are routine for a source category. Until recently, EPA regulations did not specify the activities included as RMRR, with eligibility determined through case-by-case analysis. This approach was approved in the leading case of Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly (\"WEPCO\"). The EPA's case-by-case approach for determining the extent, purpose, frequency, and cost of proposed work was approved in the WEPCO case. WEPCO proposed extensive renovations for its generating units, triggering NSPS and PSD-area NSR requirements for a permit before construction could begin. EPA dismissed WEPCO's proposal. The EPA approved WEPCO's proposed \"life extension\" program, which included repairs and replacements for various plant components. Despite WEPCO's argument that the proposal was RMRR, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the work was substantial and unprecedented, requiring a permit before construction could begin. The EPA approved WEPCO's \"life extension\" program, despite WEPCO's argument that it was RMRR. The Seventh Circuit ruled that the work was substantial and unprecedented, requiring a permit before construction could begin. EPA's case-by-case approach was deemed proper, considering the project's purpose, infrequency, and high cost. The RMRR exemption has been a focus, with CAA enforcement actions filed against electric utilities in the Midwest and South. The RMRR exemption in the context of \"life extension\" projects has been a focus, with CAA enforcement actions filed against electric utilities in the Midwest and South. The high cost and infrequency of these projects point to their non-routineness. President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group directed EPA to review the impact of NSR controls on investment in new utility and refinery projects. President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group directed EPA to review the impact of NSR controls on investment in new utility and refinery projects. This led to EPA's June, 2002 report to the President on the impact of NSR, which emphasized the need to specify certain activities as \"routine maintenance.\" EPA then published final regulations on December 31, 2002, affecting power plants in the South. The EPA's June 2002 report to the President highlighted the impact of NSR controls on investment in new utility and refinery projects. In response, the EPA published final regulations on December 31, 2002, which included changes to how emission increases are calculated for NSR purposes and proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying qualifying activity categories. In 2002, EPA finalized regulations for NSR purposes, changing how sources calculate emission increases from changes and amending NSR rules. EPA also proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying qualifying activity categories. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman addressed violations of the CAA by TVA for projects exceeding RMRR. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman addressed violations of the CAA by TVA for projects exceeding RMRR without permits. EPA's multi-factor test for RMRR was endorsed in the decision. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA allows EPA to issue ACOs as law, but penalties for noncompliance must be proven in district court, allowing TVA to violate ACOs without fear of penalty. The CAA empowers EPA to issue ACOs as law, but penalties for noncompliance must be proven in district court. TVA was found free to violate ACOs without fear of penalty. The RMRR exception enforcement was reshaped in October 2003 with the final rule on equipment replacement. The final rule in October 2003 reshaped the enforcement of the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. The final rule in October 2003 reshaped the enforcement of the RMRR exception by declaring specific equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, aiming to provide greater regulatory certainty without compromising environmental protection. EPA's new approach addresses criticism of the old case-by-case method, which was seen as hindering important activities for plant operation. EPA has yet to take action on the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance.\" The final rule in October 2003 reshaped the enforcement of the RMRR exception by specifying equipment replacement activities as RMRR, addressing criticism of the old case-by-case approach. EPA has not yet acted on the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance.\" The final rule in October 2003 reshaped the enforcement of the RMRR exception by specifying equipment replacement activities as RMRR. The new rule states that replacing components with identical ones or functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the cost is less than 20% of the unit's current replacement value, does not alter design parameters, and meets emission limitations. The new rule allows for the replacement of components under more circumstances than the former case-by-case approach, as long as the cost is less than 20% of the unit's current replacement value and does not change the unit's design parameters. The former approach is still available as an alternative, but it is expected that the new per se approach will make the case-by-case approach less common. The new rule allows for more component replacements than the former case-by-case approach, with higher thresholds making the latter uncommon. No recordkeeping requirements are imposed, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. The rule only applies to conduct after its effective date and does not serve as a defense for pending CAA enforcement. The new rule allows for more component replacements with higher thresholds, making the former case-by-case approach uncommon. It imposes no recordkeeping requirements, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. The rule applies only to conduct after its effective date and does not serve as a defense for pending CAA enforcement actions. Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging the rule. In State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency, multiple states and environmental groups challenge the equipment-replacement RMRR rule, arguing it exceeds EPA's authority under the CAA. The court granted a motion to stay the rule pending full review, citing irreparable harm demonstrated by the petitioners. The equipment-replacement RMRR rule is being challenged in the State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency case. The court granted a motion to stay the rule, citing irreparable harm demonstrated by the petitioners. EPA faces an uphill battle in defending the rule as it remains suspended. The court granted a motion to stay the new equipment-replacement rule, citing irreparable harm demonstrated by the petitioners. This suspension means the old case-by-case approach continues to apply, indicating a challenging defense for the EPA. The court declined to consolidate the actions with another group of cases challenging a previous rule but designated the same panel for both sets of cases due to their related nature."
