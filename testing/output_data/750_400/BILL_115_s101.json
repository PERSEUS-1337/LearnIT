The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land. The Federal land will be used for a road corridor and a single-lane gravel road in the Refuge. Valuation and appraisals will determine the exchange value of the lands. The exchange involves designating a road corridor and constructing a single-lane gravel road in the Refuge. Valuation and appraisals will ensure equal value exchange between Federal and non-Federal lands. The exchange of Federal land will be equalized through appraisals conducted by selected appraisers in accordance with specified requirements. The Secretary and State will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with nationally recognized standards. Equalization of Federal land surplus will be done through appraisals conducted by selected appraisers. Equalization of federal land surplus will be achieved by appraising the final values of Federal and non-Federal land to be conveyed in a land exchange, ensuring they are equalized. Equalization of federal land surplus will be achieved by appraising the final values of Federal and non-Federal land to be conveyed in a land exchange, ensuring they are equalized through various methods such as conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or using a combination of methods. The equalization of federal land surplus in a land exchange can be achieved by conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or using a combination of both methods if the final appraised value of the non-Federal land exceeds that of the Federal land. The final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeding that of Federal land in a land exchange requires equalization by adjusting the acreage of non-Federal land to be conveyed. The State will adjust the acreage of non-Federal land to be conveyed to equalize values in a land exchange. The Secretary may accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. Upon completion, the Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land, and non-Federal land will be administered. The land exchange under this section will modify the Wilderness boundary to exclude Federal land and add non-Federal land to be administered in accordance with the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The exchange must be completed within 180 days of enactment.
