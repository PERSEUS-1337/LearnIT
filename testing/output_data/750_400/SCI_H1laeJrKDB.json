Recent works have focused on studying the semantics of the latent space to improve control and understanding of the generative process. This paper introduces a new method to enhance interpretability by identifying meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control. In this paper, a new method is proposed to improve the interpretability of the latent space in generative models. The method allows for precise control over specific properties of generated images, such as object position or scale, through weakly supervised learning. It is particularly effective for simple transformations like translation, zoom, or color variations. The method is demonstrated to be effective qualitatively. Our method allows for precise control over specific properties of generated images, such as object position or scale, through weakly supervised learning. It is effective for simple transformations like translation, zoom, or color variations, demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively for GANs and variational auto-encoders. Our method provides control over specific properties of generated images through weakly supervised learning, benefiting generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders. The success of recent generative models in producing high-resolution images has led to various applications like image in-painting and deep-fakes, but the lack of control over generated images limits their use. More control could enhance approaches for generating new training examples by allowing users to choose specific image properties. Generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders lack control over generated images, limiting their use in applications such as image in-painting and deep-fakes. More control could improve approaches for generating new training examples by allowing users to choose specific image properties. Initial attempts have shown that modifying attributes of generated images is possible by manipulating latent codes or combining them. Studying the latent space of generative models provides insights into their structure, which is valuable for enhancing their capabilities. Initial attempts have shown that modifying attributes of generated images is possible by manipulating latent codes or combining them. The study of the latent space of generative models provides insights into their structure, which is valuable for enhancing their capabilities. Generative models can learn unsupervised data representations, with latent spaces exhibiting a vector space structure encoding factors of variations like objects, positions, and lighting in images. Factors of variations are categorized as modal (discrete values) and size-related. Images are generated based on factors of variation like objects, positions, and lighting. These factors can be modal (discrete values) or continuous (range of values). Humans naturally describe images using these factors, which efficiently represent natural scenes. The size and position of objects in images are described by continuous factors of variation, which represent a range of possible values. Humans naturally describe images using factors of variation, such as objects, positions, and relations. This approach is seen as an efficient representation of natural images. The control over image generation in generative models is often limited to discrete factors. In this paper, the authors propose a method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over image generation. Previous works have limitations in controlling both discrete and continuous factors of variation in images. The authors propose a method to control specific continuous factors of variations in image generation using generative models. They focus on factors such as vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, which previous works have not addressed effectively. The method proposed can control specific continuous factors of variations in image generation without the need for labeled datasets or an encoder model. It focuses on factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, which can be adapted to other variations such as rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. Our method allows for precise control of generative processes by focusing on factors like position and scale. It does not require a labeled dataset or encoder model and can be adapted to various transformations. The effectiveness of our method can be quantitatively measured, revealing insights about the latent space structure. The method proposed allows for precise control of generative processes by finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. It demonstrates that properties of generated images can be controlled by sampling latent representations along linear directions and introduces a novel reconstruction loss for inverting. The main contributions include proposing a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for controlling generated images precisely. Additionally, a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models is introduced, along with insights on the difficulty of inverting generative models with optimization. The impacts of disentanglement on controlling generative models are also studied. The text discusses a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models and the impacts of disentanglement on controlling these models. It highlights the difficulty of inverting generative models with optimization and emphasizes the ease of modifying properties of an image compared to obtaining a label describing that property. The text discusses the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining labels. It mentions determining latent codes for transformed images to find the direction in latent space for specific transformations. The text discusses finding the direction in latent space for specific transformations in a generative model. It aims to find the latent code zT that approximates the transformed image T(I) compared to the original generated image G(z0). The text discusses finding the latent code zT that approximates the transformed image T(I) compared to the original generated image G(z0) in a generative model. It aims to estimate the direction encoding the factor of variation described by T by minimizing a reconstruction error between the images. The text discusses finding the latent code zT that approximates the transformed image T(I) by minimizing a reconstruction error L between I and \u00ce = G(\u1e91). The choice of the reconstruction error L is crucial in this optimization problem, with the pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) being commonly used in the literature. The text discusses solutions for unrealistic reconstructed images caused by low likelihood regions in the distribution used during training. The choice of the reconstruction error L is crucial, with pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) commonly used but known to produce blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed to address this issue. The text discusses the issue of blurry images caused by pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and proposes studying the effect of MSE on images in the frequency domain to address this issue. Alternative reconstruction errors have been suggested to overcome the blurriness problem. The text explores the limitations of pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) in image reconstruction, suggesting that the MSE favors uniform textures due to the generator's limited capacity and low-dimensional latent space. This results in blurry images as arbitrary texture patterns cannot be accurately reproduced. The text discusses the limitations of pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) in image reconstruction, attributing the preference for uniform textures to the generator's limited capacity and low-dimensional latent space. It explains that high frequencies in the Fourier domain contribute to blurry solutions as they cannot be accurately encoded in the latent space. The text proposes reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function to achieve sharper results in image reconstruction. This adjustment aims to address the limitations of pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) by minimizing the contribution of high frequencies to the blurriness of the generated images. Reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function improves image sharpness and allows for more detailed and realistic generated images. This adjustment addresses the blurriness caused by high frequencies in image reconstruction. Using equation 2 allows for a larger range of possibilities for G(z), resulting in images with more details and realistic textures. A comparison to other losses, such as LPIPS, is provided. The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved through equation 2. We report a quantitative comparison to other losses, specifically the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) by Zhang et al. (2018). The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved through an approach that avoids using an L2 penalty on the norm of z. This method generalizes to pixel-wise losses by assuming nearby pixels follow similar patterns. The optimization problem involves finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) without using an L2 penalty on the norm of z. A dataset of trajectories in the latent space is created to correspond to a transformation T in the pixel space, parametrized by \u03b4t. Algorithm 1 involves creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space, parametrized by \u03b4t. The input includes the number of trajectories, generator G, transformation function T, trajectories length N, and threshold \u0398. In practice, initializing the problem can be difficult and lead to slow convergence. Zhu et al. (2016) suggested using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization. Training a specific network for this task is costly. Linear combinations of natural images do not result in natural images, highlighting the curved nature of the manifold. Initialization can lead to slow convergence. Zhu et al. (2016) proposed using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization. Training a specific network for this task is costly. Linear combinations of natural images do not result in natural images, showing the curved nature of the manifold in pixel space. The optimization on the manifold of natural images in pixel space is guided by decomposing transformations into smaller steps, allowing for faster convergence without the need for extra training. This approach contrasts with Zhu et al. (2016) and does not require a new model to be trained. Our approach decomposes transformations into smaller steps for faster convergence without extra training, contrasting with Zhu et al. (2016). It does not require training a new model and can be used directly. The method ignores undefined regions in images and deals with limitations of generative models. When applying our method to image transformations, we ignore undefined regions and consider limitations of generative models. The generative model may not be able to produce images outside the dataset's object shape positions, posing a challenge when generating transformed images. When generating images from a random start point, there is a risk of outliers that are not within the dataset's object shape positions. To address this, we discard latent codes with high reconstruction errors, removing one tenth of them. This process is outlined in Algorithm 1 for generating trajectories in the latent space. After discarding latent codes with high reconstruction errors to reduce outliers, Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories in the latent space. A model is then defined to predict factors of variations encoded in the latent space based on the coordinate of the latent code along an axis. After discarding outliers, Algorithm 1 generates trajectories in the latent space. A model is defined to predict factors of variations encoded in the latent space based on the latent code's coordinate along an axis. The distribution of factors of variations is determined by a monotonic differentiable function. The model f : Z \u2192 R defines t = f(z) = g(z, u), where g is a monotonic differentiable function. When z \u223c N(0, I), the distribution of t = g(z, u) is given by \u03d5 : R \u2192 R+. For the dSprite dataset, the horizontal position factor x follows a uniform distribution U([-0.5, 0.5]), while the projection of z onto axis u follows N(0, 1). Adopting g : R \u2192 [-0.5, 0.5], we have x = g(z, u). The distribution of the parameter t is not known, so a parametrized model g \u03b8 : R \u2192 R with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u) is adopted. Piece-wise linear functions are typically used for g \u03b8, but this model cannot be trained directly without access to t. The distribution of the parameter t is unknown, so a parametrized model g \u03b8 : R \u2192 R with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u) is used. Piece-wise linear functions are typically employed for g \u03b8. However, the model cannot be trained directly without access to t. To address this issue, \u03b4t is modeled instead of t, and u and \u03b8 are estimated by training f (\u03b8,u) to minimize the MSE between \u03b4 t and f (\u03b8,u) (z \u03b4t ) \u2212 f (\u03b8,u) (z 0 ). The distribution of the parameter t is unknown, so a parametrized model g \u03b8 : R \u2192 R with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u) is used. To address this issue, \u03b4t is modeled instead of t, and u and \u03b8 are estimated by training f (\u03b8,u) to minimize the MSE between \u03b4 t and f (\u03b8,u) (z \u03b4t ) \u2212 f (\u03b8,u) (z 0 ). This method allows for the estimation of the distribution of images generated by G and the ability to choose how to sample images. The method involves estimating the distribution of images generated by G using gradient descent on a dataset produced by Algorithm 1. It allows for control over both individual outputs and the overall distribution of the generative model's outputs. This approach provides a way to sample images based on a given transformation and an arbitrary distribution. By transforming z \u223c N (0, 1) with an arbitrary distribution \u03c6 : R \u2192 R +, we can control the output distribution of a generative model. This knowledge can help identify biases in the training dataset. Experiments were conducted on the dSprites dataset, consisting of binary images with varying shapes, positions, scales, and orientations. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites, consisting of binary images with varying shapes, and ILSVRC, containing natural images from one thousand categories. The implementation was done using TensorFlow 2.0 and the code is available online. The experiments utilized the dSprites dataset for studying disentanglement and the ILSVRC dataset for natural images. TensorFlow 2.0 was used for implementation, with a BigGAN model taking two vectors as inputs for image generation. The study utilized a BigGAN model with weights from TensorFlow-Hub for image generation. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs, with the latent vector split into six parts for different scale levels. Conditional Batch Normalization layers were used to modify the style of the generated image. Additionally, several \u03b2-VAEs were trained to explore disentanglement in generation control. The study trained \u03b2-VAEs to explore disentanglement in controlling image generation at different scale levels using Conditional Batch Normalization layers. The models were trained on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps, focusing on evaluating the method's effectiveness on complex datasets. The study trained \u03b2-VAEs on dSprites using an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps with a batch size of 128 images and a learning rate of 5e\u22124. Evaluation focused on position and scale variations, with effective estimation on simple datasets like dSprites but requiring saliency detection for natural images from BigGAN. The study focused on analyzing position and scale variations in datasets like dSprites and natural images from BigGAN. Saliency detection was used to estimate the position of objects in natural images, while the scale was evaluated based on the proportion of salient pixels. The study utilized saliency detection to estimate position and scale variations in datasets like dSprites and natural images. The evaluation procedure involved generating images with latent codes and estimating the real value of the factor of variation. Jahanian et al. (2019) proposed an alternative quantitative method. The study proposed a method to evaluate position and scale variations using latent codes and generating images. A quantitative analysis was performed on various object categories, offering a more generic approach compared to previous methods. The proposed method offers a more generic approach for quantitative evaluation using an object detector. Results show precise control over object position and scale for selected ILSVRC categories. Results from the analysis on selected ILSVRC categories show precise control over object position and scale using the proposed method. Common directions were learned across all datasets, indicating independence from the category of interest. The study merged all trajectory datasets to learn a common direction, showing shared factors of variation across categories. Results are illustrated in Figure 2 and qualitative results in Figure 3. The analysis also identified parts of the latent code used for encoding position and scale in BigGAN's hierarchical latent code structure. The study analyzed shared factors of variation across categories using trajectory datasets. Results in Figure 3 show how spatial factors are encoded in the first part of the latent code in BigGAN's hierarchical structure. The study analyzed spatial factors encoded in the latent code of BigGAN's hierarchical structure. Results show that spatial variations are mainly encoded in the first part of the latent code, with level 5 contributing more to y position than x position and scale. Quantitative results on ILSVRC dataset categories for training and validation are also reported. The study analyzed spatial factors encoded in BigGAN's latent code, with level 5 contributing more to y position than x position and scale. Quantitative results on ILSVRC dataset categories for training and validation are reported, showing variations in geometric transformations. The study analyzed spatial factors in BigGAN's latent code, showing variations in geometric transformations such as horizontal and vertical translations and scaling. The algorithm may fail at large scales due to poor performance of the saliency model when the object covers most of the image. This could be attributed to correlations between the object's vertical position and background, affected by vertical translation due to the horizon. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on the performance of \u03b2-VAE models trained on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Results in Figure 5 demonstrate the ability to control the object's position in the image by moving in the latent space. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on the performance of \u03b2-VAE models trained on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Results in Figure 5 show that as \u03b2 increases, the standard deviation decreases, allowing for more precise control of the object's position in the generated image. The study focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control their generative process. It highlights the importance of disentangled representations for precise control over the position of generated images, especially with larger \u03b2 values. Our work aims to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over the generative process. We distinguish between GAN-like models and auto-encoders, with conditional GANs allowing users to choose specific properties of generated images. Conditional GANs and VAEs offer different approaches for controlling the generation of images, with the former allowing for specific property selection and the latter facing a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and sample plausibility. Our method for image generation does not require labeled datasets or direct control, unlike other approaches such as VAE and InfoGan which rely on specific properties or codes for control. Our method for image generation does not require labels or direct control, unlike other approaches like VAE and InfoGan. InfoGan adds a code to the GAN generator input to disentangle the latent space, while our method can find meaningful directions in generative models without changing the learning process. Our approach focuses on finding meaningful directions in generative models without changing the learning process, contrasting with methods like InfoGan. Our work analyzes the latent space rather than intermediate activations in the generator, offering a different perspective on controlling the presence of objects in generated images. In contrast to previous works focusing on intermediate activations, our method analyzes the latent space in generative models to find the latent representation of an image without an encoder. This approach offers a unique perspective on controlling object presence in generated images. The method involves finding the latent representation of an image without an encoder by optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error. Previous works have shown success on simple datasets but struggle with more complex ones. The inversion process involves optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error between the generated image and the target image. Previous methods have struggled with complex datasets like ILSVRC, but a reconstruction loss introduced in Section 2.1.1 significantly improves reconstruction quality. The difficulties in inverting a generative model are theoretically justified. The reconstruction loss in complex datasets like ILSVRC is improved significantly, with a focus on inverting generative models. White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness in vector space arithmetic. An algorithmic data augmentation called \"synthetic attribute\" generates less blurry images with a VAE. This work directly addresses the loss function, differentiating it from previous works on ArXiv. White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness in vector space arithmetic and introduces a data augmentation method called \"synthetic attribute\" for generating less blurry images with a VAE. Recent works on ArXiv focus on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, particularly in the BigGAN model. Recent works on ArXiv emphasize the importance of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, such as the BigGAN model. While similar to other methods in using transformations and linear trajectories, the approach differs in the training procedure by first generating a dataset of trajectories before model training. The approach in finding interpretable directions in the latent space of the BigGAN model differs in training procedure and evaluation method compared to other methods. They generate a dataset of trajectories before model training and use a saliency model for evaluation, allowing measurement on more categories. Additionally, insights on controlling auto-encoders with the method are provided. Our model allows for precise control over the generative process and proposes an alternative reconstruction error for inverting generators. The main difference identified is the model of the latent space used. The impact of disentangled representations on the control and structure of the latent space of BigGAN is explored. A method is proposed to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control. In the context of exploring disentangled representations in the latent space of BigGAN, a method is proposed to extract meaningful directions for precise control over generated images. This approach aims to enhance the interpretability and control of generative models. In exploring disentangled representations in BigGAN's latent space, a method is proposed to control image properties using intuitive factors like translation and scale. This helps in understanding the learned representations of generative models. The Fourier transform is used to compute the loss contribution of a particular frequency in the generated image. In exploring disentangled representations in BigGAN's latent space, a method is proposed to control image properties using intuitive factors like translation and scale. The Fourier transform is used to compute the loss contribution of a particular frequency in the generated image, considering a target image I and a generated image \u00ce determined by a reconstruction loss. The disability of the generator to model high-frequency patterns is modeled as uncertainty on the phase of high frequencies in the generated image. The contribution to the total loss in the optimization process depends on the magnitude r of the Fourier transform of the generated image. Smoother images with less high frequencies are favored during optimization. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations for images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture was designed for experiments, generating 64x64 images with a decoder network using transposed convolutions. The optimization process favors smoother images with smaller magnitudes in high frequencies, directly influenced by the term r in the total loss function. The \u03b2-VAE architecture aims to create interpretable latent representations for images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture was used to generate 64x64 images, with the decoder network employing transposed convolutions. The architecture includes Convolution + ReLU and Dense + ReLU layers, with specific filter sizes and units specified. The architecture includes Convolution + ReLU and Dense + ReLU layers with specific filter sizes and units. Wang et al., 2004, and our loss are referenced in the context of the architecture. The architecture involves multiple Transposed Convolution layers with specific filter sizes and strides, followed by a Sigmoid layer. Results show artifacts when using the loss function without constraining z, and qualitative reconstruction results are shown for different values of \u03c3, with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5 yielding good results. Results are presented with our loss function, showing artifacts without constraining z. Qualitative reconstruction results for different \u03c3 values are displayed, with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5 providing good results. A comparison with classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) is also shown, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The approach presented in the study compares favorably to classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) methods. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the reconstruction and the avoidance of artifacts by restricting z to a ball of radius \u221a d. Additionally, a quantitative evaluation of the approach's performance was conducted on images from the ILSVRC dataset. The study's approach compares well with MSE and DSSIM methods, showing accurate reconstruction and artifact avoidance by limiting z to a ball of radius \u221a d. A quantitative evaluation on images from the ILSVRC dataset was performed, with results reported in Table 2. The study compared reconstruction methods on ILSVRC dataset images, showing that their method outperformed MSE and DSSIM in perceptual similarity. The optimization problem is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold. The study compared reconstruction methods on ILSVRC dataset images, showing that their method outperformed MSE and DSSIM in perceptual similarity. Images reconstructed using their method are perceptually closer to the target image. The optimization problem is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold, especially for factors of variation like translation, rotation, and scaling. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations is curved in pixel space. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling is curved in pixel space. This is illustrated by showing that the trajectory described by an image undergoing these transformations is curved in pixel space. The experiment involved computing the PCA of resulting trajectories and plotting them on the two main axes of the PCA. The experiment involved visualizing images from the dSprites dataset undergoing progressive transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling. The trajectory of these transformations in pixel space was found to be curved, with issues arising for large translations and rotations. Brightness changes, however, did not pose the same problem due to being a linear transformation in pixel space. During optimization of the latent code, the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to the generated image is affected by the near orthogonality of transformations like translation and rotation in pixel-space. This issue does not occur for linear transformations like brightness changes. In an ideal scenario where G is a bijection between Z and natural image manifold, the gradient of the error with respect to the latent code is small when transformations are near orthogonal. When optimizing the latent code, the gradient of the reconstruction loss is affected by near orthogonality in transformations like translation and rotation in pixel-space. In an ideal scenario with G as a bijection between Z and natural image manifold, the gradient of the error with respect to the latent code is small when transformations are near orthogonal. When optimizing the latent code, near orthogonality in transformations like translation and rotation in pixel-space affects the gradient of the reconstruction loss. In an ideal scenario with G as a bijection between Z and natural image manifold, the gradient of the error with respect to the latent code is small when transformations are near orthogonal. The basis of vectors tangent to the manifold at point G(z) is crucial for optimization, as slowing down or stopping can occur if the gradient of the loss with respect to the generated image is orthogonal to the manifold.

The basis of vectors tangent to the manifold at point G(z) is crucial for optimization, as slowing down or stopping can occur if the gradient of the loss with respect to the generated image is orthogonal to the manifold. For example, in a scenario with an ideal GAN generating a small white circle on a black background, moving the circle from left to right results in a zero reconstruction error if the circles do not intersect. Additional qualitative examples are provided for different geometric transformations and brightness changes. The curr_chunk discusses qualitative examples for 10 categories of the ILSVRC dataset, showcasing images generated with the BigGAN model for position, scale, and brightness transformations. The images' latent codes are sampled using specific methods to produce interesting results. The curr_chunk demonstrates qualitative examples of images generated with the BigGAN model for position, scale, and brightness transformations. The images' latent codes are sampled in a specific manner to control these attributes. Some categories may not have controlled brightness due to the lack of dark images in the training data. The curr_chunk discusses how brightness categories are affected by the environment and the absence of dark images in the training data. It also mentions that direction is learned for position and scale on ten categories, while only the top five categories are used for brightness."
