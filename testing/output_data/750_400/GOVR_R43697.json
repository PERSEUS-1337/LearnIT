    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in Guinea, West Africa since March 2014. The World Health Organization states there is minimal risk of contracting EVD on a plane. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, West Africa, reported in March 2014, is the largest and most persistent ever documented. It has spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, with cases in Nigeria and Senegal as well. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, resulting in almost 5,000 deaths. WHO updates on EVD cases can be found at http://www.who.int/ebola. The Ebola outbreak is spreading in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, with cases in Nigeria and Senegal. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, resulting in almost 5,000 deaths. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher due to inadequate surveillance. Mali reported its first EVD case, and Cote d'Ivoire may have undetected cases. WHO is monitoring the situation closely. Due to weak disease surveillance systems in the region, WHO estimates actual Ebola cases may be higher than reported. Mali reported its first EVD case, and Cote d'Ivoire may have undetected cases. WHO is sending a team to Mali for clinical management and contact tracing. Efforts are underway to develop Ebola vaccines for testing on health workers and volunteers in January. WHO is sending a team to Mali to assist with clinical management, epidemiology, contact tracing, and social mobilization. Efforts are being made to develop Ebola vaccines for testing on health workers and volunteers in January. Treatment for EVD symptoms involves supportive care to reduce the fatality rate, as there are no proven drugs to prevent or treat the disease. Disease surveillance and containment measures can help limit the spread of the disease. The WHO is sending a team to Mali to assist with clinical management, epidemiology, contact tracing, and social mobilization. Efforts are being made to develop Ebola vaccines for testing on health workers and volunteers in January. Treatment for EVD symptoms involves supportive care to reduce the fatality rate. Disease surveillance and containment measures can help limit the spread of the disease. Some 20,000 health workers and volunteers may have a treatment available in Liberia by early November. WHO has released manuals outlining patient care, management of contaminated objects, safe burial practices, and diagnostic protocols to contain the Ebola virus in West Africa. The WHO has released manuals outlining patient care, management of contaminated objects, safe burial practices, and diagnostic protocols for Ebola containment in West Africa. The current outbreak is spreading quickly due to ill-equipped health systems in affected countries. Key factors distinguishing this outbreak include its emergence in West Africa. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is spreading quickly due to ill-equipped health systems in affected countries. Key factors distinguishing this outbreak include its emergence in West Africa and simultaneous multi-country outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has spread rapidly, with intense disease transmission along shared borders. Efforts to detect the disease at borders have been unsuccessful, leading to imported cases in other countries. Contact tracing and containment measures have successfully halted the spread in Senegal and Nigeria, where the outbreak ended on October 17 and 19, respectively. In Senegal and Nigeria, Ebola outbreak ended on October 17 and 19, respectively. Imported cases resulted in outbreaks in both countries, infecting 20 people and killing eight in Nigeria. A single imported case in Senegal was contained. WHO is investigating a new EVD case in Mali. Health workers in the United States and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients in October. No additional cases reported from the health workers. No other reports of EVD outside Africa. In Senegal, a single imported Ebola case was contained. WHO is investigating a new Ebola case in Mali. Health workers in the United States and Spain contracted Ebola while caring for patients in October. No additional cases reported from the health workers. No reports of Ebola spreading in other countries where patients have been evacuated. Outbreaks are now occurring in both rural and urban areas, posing challenges for responders in densely populated urban settings lacking sufficient resources. The current Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in urban and rural areas, posing challenges for responders due to lack of resources. In Liberia, cases are doubling every 15-20 days, and in Sierra Leone, cases are doubling every 30-40 days. The scale and pace of transmission are unprecedented. The Ebola outbreak is rapidly spreading in densely populated urban areas with limited access to clean water and healthcare. Cases are doubling every 15-20 days in Liberia and every 30-40 days in Sierra Leone. Weak health systems are contributing to the unabated spread of the virus. Additionally, a separate Ebola outbreak unrelated to the West Africa outbreak was detected in the DRC in August 2014. A separate Ebola outbreak was detected in the DRC on August 24, 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths reported as of October 20. This is the seventh outbreak of EVD in the DRC since 1976. Since August 24, 2014, there have been 66 cases and 49 deaths in the DRC due to Ebola. Congressional actions have been accelerating to address the outbreak, with hearings held and legislation introduced to recognize the severity of the situation. Several committees have convened hearings on the Ebola outbreak, and in July and September 2014, U.S. Representative Karen Bass and Senator Christopher Coons introduced legislation recognizing the severe impacts and threats of the outbreak. Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 113-164, Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015) providing $88 million for the Ebola response, including $30 million for CDC activities in West Africa and $58 million for research on treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was also permitted to reprogram $750 million for Overseas Humanitarian Disaster. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 provided $88 million for the Ebola response, including $30 million for CDC activities in West Africa and $58 million for research on treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was allowed to reprogram $750 million for Overseas Humanitarian Disaster. The Department of Defense allocated FY2014 OHDACA funds to build 17 ETUs in Liberia and support U.S. efforts in the region amidst the Ebola crisis. The health systems in affected countries were already weak and overwhelmed by the outbreak, with six key components identified by WHO. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have become overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six key components of a health system, with severe deficiencies in each area exacerbating the challenges. Constraints in these components enable the virus to continue spreading in the affected countries. The Ebola outbreak in affected countries has worsened deficiencies in their health systems, leading to government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist, prompting the use of armed forces by affected governments. The spread of the Ebola outbreak in affected countries has led to perceptions of government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist, prompting the use of armed forces by affected governments to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods. Concerns about human rights, food scarcity, and possible unrest have been raised, leading to criticisms of the effectiveness of quarantines. Liberia and Sierra Leone have halted disease control measures following protests and criticisms. The affected governments have used armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods, leading to public resentment. Some have criticized the effectiveness of quarantines, citing concerns about human rights, food scarcity, and unrest. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods due to protests and criticisms. Sierra Leone officials considered a \"Stay Home House to House\" campaign successful, detecting 56 Ebola cases. Despite concerns about quarantine practices, Sierra Leonean officials considered a three-day \"Stay Home House to House\" sensitization campaign successful, with 92 bodies recovered and 56 Ebola cases detected. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities and delays in compensation for health workers. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, contributing to poor conditions in health facilities. Health workers face delays in compensation, leading to absenteeism and worker shortages. Some workers abandoned their posts during the Ebola outbreak due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, have started providing financial aid to Liberia for salary support. The Ebola outbreak intensified, leading to health workers abandoning their posts due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to Liberia to support payment of health workers' salaries. Financial support is needed for the national Ebola response plans in affected countries. Financial aid is being offered to Liberia to support health workers' salaries and other incentives due to a lack of financial resources in Ebola-affected countries. Donors have pledged support, but gaps remain. The United Nations estimates that Guinea needs $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the outbreak's health and secondary effects. The United Nations estimates that Guinea needs $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the Ebola outbreak. Shortages of health workers and clinics in Liberia are leaving many infected individuals without medical care, while Sierra Leone and Guinea also face challenges with access to healthcare facilities. Human resource constraints and concerns about health center conditions are leading people to care for the sick themselves, contributing to the virus's spread. The majority of Ebola-infected people in Liberia lack access to medical care, leading to people caring for the sick themselves and spreading the virus. This shortage of medics and health facilities also affects those needing care for non-EVD related issues. Observers are concerned about clinic closures impacting broader health issues, such as maternal and child health. The shortage of medics and health facilities in Ebola-affected countries is impacting access to care for both Ebola and non-Ebola related issues. Clinic closures are exacerbating broader health issues, particularly maternal and child health, with high mortality rates in these areas before the outbreak. Maternal and child mortality rates in Ebola-affected countries were among the highest globally. In 2012, 26% of maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa occurred in these countries, with over 46,000 women dying from pregnancy-related complications. Additionally, nearly 1 million children died before their fifth birthday in these countries, accounting for 30% of under-five deaths in the region. Many of these deaths could have been prevented with access to vaccines, clean water, sanitation, and nutrition. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting Ebola. In Ebola-affected countries, nearly 1 million children died before their fifth birthday, representing 30% of under-five deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these deaths could have been prevented with access to vaccines, clean water, sanitation, and nutrition. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities out of fear of contracting Ebola, leading to difficulties in receiving medical attention during labor and delivery. Liberia is experiencing more deaths from treatable ailments and common medical conditions than from Ebola. Many in Ebola-affected countries are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting the virus, leading to difficulties in receiving medical attention during labor and delivery. The United Nations reports that more people in Liberia are dying from treatable ailments and common medical conditions than from Ebola. The lack of health workers in affected countries contributes to high maternal and child mortality rates. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. High maternal and child mortality rates in Ebola-affected countries are linked to the shortage of health workers. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the outbreak, with only about 50 remaining afterwards. EVD deaths among health workers have further reduced staffing levels, with 443 health workers contracting EVD and 244 dying. After the Ebola outbreak, Liberia was left with only about 50 doctors to provide clinical care, as many expatriate doctors were evacuated. The shortage of healthcare workers was exacerbated by the deaths of 244 health workers who contracted EVD. WHO reported that 443 health workers had contracted EVD, with over 40% of deaths occurring in Liberia. Ebola control requires a large number of healthcare workers, with WHO estimating that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients needs at least 250 healthcare workers. The Ebola outbreak left Liberia with only 50 doctors for clinical care, as many were evacuated. 244 health workers died from EVD, with over 40% of deaths in Liberia. WHO estimates that 70 Ebola patients need 250 healthcare workers for treatment. The affected countries need over 13,000 health workers for care, contact tracing, and safe burial, with 5% from foreign countries and the rest national staff. The Ebola outbreak has severely impacted healthcare in affected countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone, leaving them with limited access to clinics and closed health facilities. WHO estimated that over 13,000 health workers are needed to combat the spread of EVD, with only 5% coming from foreign countries. Countries are now deploying medics to the region to address the shortage of healthcare personnel. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone has led to a shortage of health personnel, with many health facilities closed. Access to clinics was already limited before the outbreak, and now large parts of the population lack access to general healthcare and Ebola-specific treatment. Patients often have to travel long distances to seek medical help. Limited access to clinics in urban areas and concentration of Ebola treatment centers in high prevalence areas leave a large portion of the population without healthcare. Patients often travel long distances for medical help, leading to delayed treatment and reduced survival prospects for Ebola patients. Various health services, including treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services, are needed to control the outbreak. Limited access to healthcare in urban areas and concentration of Ebola treatment centers in high prevalence areas lead to delayed health-seeking practices, reducing survival prospects for Ebola patients. Severe deficiencies in health services, including treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services, hinder efforts to detect and contain the virus. Patients turned away from treatment facilities often return to their communities, potentially infecting more people. Severe deficiencies in health services, including treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services, hinder efforts to detect and contain the virus. Liberia faces the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of the needed beds available. CDC estimates fatality rates could be halved with improved access to treatment and healthcare. CDC estimates that fatality rates could be halved with improved access to treatment and healthcare. Liberia is facing a severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of the needed beds available. WHO estimates that Liberia has only 23% of the beds needed to treat those sickened by EVD. Treatment capacity is expected to improve with U.S. plans to support the construction of 27 ETUs in the country. Safe disposal of dead bodies is also improving in Liberia, with roughly 90% being removed within 24 hours. Health experts are investigating a recent reduction in people seeking Ebola care in Liberia, leaving some beds vacant. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working with community leaders to adapt funeral practices that can facilitate transmission. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is a concern. In Liberia, 90% of dead bodies are removed within 24 hours of being reported to the National Call Center. EVD responders are addressing traditional funeral practices that can spread the virus. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is contributing to Ebola cases among health workers. In Liberia, inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is contributing to Ebola cases among health workers, with multiple opportunities for transmission identified by CDC. Inadequate use of protective equipment and hand washing, along with interruptions in water supply, further hinder sanitation efforts. During a September tour of Liberia, CDC Director Tom Frieden noted inconsistent availability and use of gloves and hand washing, as well as interruptions in water supply in health clinics. Only one out of 29 health centers surveyed had running water, and poor conditions of the facilities discourage attendance. Power outages, lack of potable water, and limited ambulance services are common in both rural and urban areas. Dr. Frieden observed poor sanitation conditions in health centers during his tour of the affected region. Lack of running water, power outages, and limited ambulance services contribute to the challenges. Shortages of protective gear for health workers are associated with Ebola cases. Shortages of protective gear in Sierra Leone contribute to the spread of Ebola among health workers and the general population due to limited supplies and resource constraints. Ambulance services are also inadequate, with only four ambulances serving a population of 465,000 people, leading to overcrowding and increased risk of infection. Limited supplies of protective equipment in affected countries pose a risk to health workers operating outside Ebola treatment centers, increasing the chances of contracting and spreading the disease. Shortages of antibiotics and safe blood further hinder the treatment of Ebola patients. Disinfectant and medicine prices have doubled due to increased demand. WHO noted shortages of PPE and medical supplies in ETUs, hindering the treatment of Ebola patients. Disinfectant and medicine prices have doubled, and transportation of aid workers and supplies is complicated by poor road conditions and suspended air service. The Ebola outbreak has led to a doubling of disinfectant and medicine prices, making it difficult for aid workers to transport supplies due to poor road conditions and limited air service. Despite improved awareness about preventing EVD infection, poverty and infrastructural deficiencies continue to hinder efforts to avoid infection. Efforts to develop alternative transportation routes have improved the situation, but limited air service remains a problem. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has increased, yet poverty and infrastructural deficiencies hinder efforts to avoid infection. Consumption of wild animals, common in areas with high food insecurity, poses risks of EVD transmission. Health officials are expanding efforts to educate the public about these risks. Hunger is a problem in affected countries, especially in rural areas where consumption of wild animals is common. Health officials are warning about the risks of eating animals like fruit bats that may carry EVD. Weak laboratory and surveillance systems are hindering efforts to contain the outbreak, with uncertainty about the number of cases, particularly in Liberia where 20% of EVD cases have been confirmed. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to uncertainty about the number of cases, especially in Liberia where 20% of cases have been confirmed. Limited laboratory capacity results in diagnosis backlogs, endangering health workers and hindering containment efforts. Limited laboratory capacity in Liberia has led to extensive diagnosis backlogs, hindering efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak. Uncertainty about the number of cases endangers health workers and other patients. International responses are increasing, but the financial requirements for containment are rising. WHO estimated it would take $4.8 million to contain the outbreak. The financial requirements for containing the Ebola outbreak are increasing as the number of cases rise. WHO estimated it would cost $4.8 million to contain the outbreak initially, but later revised the estimate to $490 million as the outbreak spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The WHO estimated it would cost $4.8 million to contain the Ebola outbreak initially, but later revised the estimate to $490 million as the outbreak spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria. By August, the outbreak had caused 3,685 EVD cases and 1,841 deaths. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate the international response. The Ebola outbreak spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, causing 3,685 cases and 1,841 deaths. The United Nations established UNMEER to coordinate the international response, urging member states to support affected countries with a $988 million plan.

Donors have contributed $493 million and pledged an additional $279 million towards the plan. As of October 29, 2014, donors have contributed $493 million towards the UN plan to address the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $279 million pledged. Resources are also being provided outside of the UN response, with a total of $894 million committed and $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. Donors have contributed $493 million towards the UN plan to address the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $279 million pledged. The total amount committed for addressing the outbreak is $894 million, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests as the outbreak continues to spread. The World Health Organization and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests for addressing the Ebola outbreak as it spreads. WHO has outlined measures for containing the outbreak by January 2014, requesting donors to provide $490 million for building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. The World Health Organization outlined measures in the Ebola Response Roadmap to contain the outbreak by January 2014, requesting $490 million for building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. Pledges for medical support have increased since September, but human resource constraints continue to hinder containment efforts. Cuba has committed to deploying health workers to the region. Since September, over 13,000 health workers have been attracted to provide care, conduct contact tracing, and implement safe burial protocols in the region affected by Ebola. Various countries have pledged medical support, including Cuba deploying 165 health professionals, the U.S. sending 65 Public Health Service officers, Britain providing 750 troops with medical officers, and China sending over 170 health workers. The African Union and East African Community have also made commitments to assist. Human resource constraints continue to impede containment efforts. Various countries have pledged medical support to the region affected by Ebola, including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, and China. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers. In response to human resource constraints, the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners developed the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households in Liberia initially, with plans to expand coverage. The African Union and East African Community have pledged to send 100 and 600 health workers respectively. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners have developed the Community Care Campaign to establish community care centers managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients. The campaign will initially target the 400,000 most vulnerable households in Liberia and expand to cover the entire country and region. The Community Care Campaign aims to establish community care centers (CCCs) managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. The Sierra Leonean government and partners are also setting up CCCs in the country. The United States is a major funder of the international Ebola response. The United States is a leading funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22.

The first 22-bed ETC is expected by October's end, with three more in November. Over 700 U.S. military personnel are in the region, including those operating mobile medical labs. Several treatment centers in Liberia with 100-bed capacity are being established as part of Operation United Assistance. The first 22-bed ETC is set to be completed by the end of October, with three more to follow in November. Over 700 U.S. military personnel, including those from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, are involved in the region, operating mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved DOD funding exceeding $1 billion for the global Ebola response. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Congress approved DOD funding exceeding $1 billion for Operation United Assistance and related activities, including mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Insufficient capacity to detect, treat, and prevent the spread of disease has weakened health systems in the region. The current Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia is expected to exceed $1 billion. Insufficient capacity to detect, treat, and prevent the spread of disease has enabled the virus to spread and further weakened health systems. Congress has enacted legislation to expand U.S. and international responses and provide funds for U.S. responses. The Administration may request additional funds to contain the outbreak. The Administration may request additional funds to contain the Ebola outbreak, as human resource constraints are most acute in Liberia. WHO estimated that it would take 13,000 health workers to contain the outbreak, but current numbers are insufficient. At the end of August, WHO estimated that 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the Ebola outbreak. Foreign governments and organizations are deploying medics, but there are not enough to meet the demands, especially in Liberia. The United States, WHO, and other groups are working on a Community Care Campaign to address the issue. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the campaign. The United States, WHO, and other groups are partnering with the Liberian government to develop a Community Care Campaign to address the limited access to Ebola care in Liberia. Doctors Without Borders has raised concerns about the campaign potentially becoming \"contamination centers\" without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, supervision, diagnostic capabilities, referral systems, and burial methods. WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the CCC if implementation quality is deficient. The Community Care Campaign in Liberia is at risk of becoming \"contamination centers\" without strict infection control, adequate supplies, trained staff, regular supervision, the ability to diagnose and refer patients, and proper burial methods. WHO warns of the major risk of virus transmission within the CCC if implementation quality is lacking. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is a key factor complicating safe implementation. The Community Care Campaign in Liberia faces challenges in ensuring quality control and adherence to infection control protocols, especially among lay personnel like family members providing Ebola care. This raises concerns about the potential spread of the virus within the CCCs. The adherence to infection control protocols by non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members providing Ebola care in the CCCs is a concern. WHO recommends that only one family member should provide care for each patient to prevent the spread of EVD within the community. To prevent the spread of EVD, WHO recommends only one family member should provide care for each patient in CCCs, but compliance may be challenging due to common collective familial care practices in Liberia and other factors like income loss and emotional stress. In Liberia, close community interaction with the ill is common, making it challenging for CCC supervisors to enforce WHO guidelines for only one family member to provide care. Factors like income loss, separation from uninfected family members, and emotional stress in CCCs may hinder compliance. IPC protocol mandates the use of personal protective equipment for handling soiled linen, cleaning CCCs, and burying EVD victims to prevent spread within CCCs. The IPC protocol requires strict adherence to personal protective equipment and waste management practices in Ebola Care Centers (CCCs) to prevent the spread of the virus. However, challenges exist in ensuring compliance due to deficiencies in waste management and limited access to sanitation facilities in affected countries. The WHO emphasizes the importance of monitoring and supervision in ensuring adherence to IPC protocol in Ebola Care Centers. Lack of access to sanitation facilities may pose a challenge for lay care takers without medical training. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE by lay care takers in Ebola Care Centers. The Community Care Campaign calls for once daily supervisory visits by health care workers trained in IPC to ensure compliance with protocols and proper use of PPE. Poor supply chain management leads to interruptions in medical supplies and a lack of protective equipment in health clinics and ETUs. Due to poor supply chain management, publicly funded health clinics in affected countries face interruptions in medical supplies, leading to a lack of protective equipment such as gloves, masks, and gowns. This shortage has been linked to Ebola virus disease (EVD) infections among health workers. Inadequate protective gear in Community Care Centers (CCCs) can result in unsafe practices like reusing PPE. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners are working to ensure a continuous supply of commodities to various CCCs, recognizing the risks involved. The supply chain management issues in health clinics have been linked to EVD infections among health workers. WHO and partners are working to ensure a continuous supply of commodities to CCCs, advising a gradual approach. USAID is implementing the Community Care Campaign through grants to NGOs for CCC management. The U.S. is implementing the Community Care Campaign through grants to NGOs for managing Community Care Centers. USAID has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia. NGOs have autonomy over the grants' implementation, with USAID overseeing to ensure program targets are met. The White House reports that the U.S. Government provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia for use at home. NGOs have autonomy over USAID grants for managing Community Care Centers, with oversight to ensure program targets are met. Questions arise about U.S. government oversight of grantees and standardization of quality control and IPC protocol. WHO leadership in the global Ebola response has faced criticism for budget cuts under reform efforts. Critics have raised concerns about U.S. oversight of grantees managing Community Care Centers and the standardization of quality control and IPC protocol. WHO leadership in the global Ebola response has been criticized for budget cuts that have reduced its effectiveness in containing outbreaks. The 2014-2015 WHO program budget proposed a 51% reduction in outbreak and crisis response activities compared to previous levels. Earlier budget cuts have also led to staff reductions and the closure of viral hemorrhagic fever facilities. Reform efforts have hampered the WHO's effectiveness in containing outbreaks, with budget cuts leading to staff reductions and closure of critical facilities. Critics also point to bureaucratic issues and the influence of underqualified staff hindering the agency's response. The closure of the viral hemorrhagic fever unit and budgetary constraints have hindered WHO's operational capacity. Critics argue that bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff with political connections have impeded the response to outbreaks. Weak health systems, inadequate WHO capacity, and insufficient international responses have sparked debates on WHO's role as an advisory body or operational entity. Analysts propose a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO for long-term health system improvements. The inadequate capacity of WHO and insufficient international responses to the Ebola outbreak have sparked debates on WHO's role as an advisory body or operational entity. Analysts suggest a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO for long-term health system improvements and addressing short-term crises like Ebola. Some advocate for a ready-to-deploy team of emergency health responders, while others cite the \"politics of sovereignty\" as a barrier to WHO leading such efforts. Donors have struggled to address health emergencies in countries with weak health systems, leading to disease-specific funding through non-governmental groups in the early 2000s. Opponents argue that this approach worsens the situation. The debate over disease-based funding in West Africa stems from concerns about weak health systems in the region. Supporters argue that this approach strengthens oversight capacity, while opponents believe it exacerbates human resource shortages and weakens government authorities. The debate over disease-specific funding in West Africa revolves around whether it strengthens oversight capacity or exacerbates human resource shortages and weakens government authorities. This debate intensified with the introduction of PEPFAR, which provided funding outside of government networks to combat HIV/AIDS. The introduction of PEPFAR intensified the debate over disease-specific funding in West Africa. U.S. agencies funded non-governmental organizations and local partners to establish care facilities, saving millions of lives. However, the U.S. became the sole supporter for many at-risk individuals worldwide. In the second phase of PEPFAR, resources were used to support health systems. In the second phase of PEPFAR, increasing portions of resources were used to support health systems to bolster country capacity. Debate on the use of PEPFAR funds for building health systems has resumed in its third phase. A 2013 GAO report noted that roughly 21% of funds were spent on capacity building projects. In its third phase, debate on the use of PEPFAR funds for building health systems has resumed. A 2013 GAO report noted that roughly 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. Health system advocates fear that budgetary reforms may imperil efforts to bolster health systems. Deborah Birx, PEPFAR Country Coordinator, aims to allocate 50% of resources to care and treatment activities. Budgetary reforms may jeopardize health system strengthening efforts. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the Ebola outbreak, needing focused support for containment. However, countries may struggle to detect and respond to future outbreaks without donor support. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, needing focused support for containment. However, countries may struggle to detect and respond to future outbreaks without donor support to bolster health systems. Ken Isaacs highlighted the importance of building strong health systems to prevent potential disease outbreaks. Donors support the development of strong health systems during emergencies like the Ebola outbreak. USAID has a working group to strengthen health systems post-outbreak. USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to support health care delivery post-outbreak. However, funding for broader health system strengthening efforts is limited, with most resources directed towards specific diseases. PEPFAR and other U.S.-funded health programs lack appropriations for broader health system strengthening efforts, with most resources directed towards specific diseases. The ongoing Ebola outbreak is being addressed by various U.S. agencies, with the Department of State leading diplomatic engagements and USAID coordinating responses. The ongoing Ebola outbreak is being addressed by various U.S. agencies, with the Department of State leading diplomatic engagements and USAID coordinating responses. Other agencies like CDC and DOD are also involved in public health and medical response activities. The U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak involves various agencies: State Department for diplomatic engagements, USAID for coordination, CDC for public health response, and DOD for support to foreign armed forces. Each agency can utilize flexible funding sources for their activities. The Department of State coordinates diplomatic engagements through existing channels and does not require additional funding. The CDC can use USAID disaster assistance accounts for outbreak responses. The DOD budget supports various domestic and international health activities without detailed congressional direction. The DOD budget supports domestic and international health activities without detailed congressional direction. Congress provides specific directives for foreign aid funds, limiting USAID's ability to address unforeseen events like the Ebola outbreak without affecting ongoing health efforts. USAID often receives specific direction from Congress on how to use foreign aid funds, limiting its ability to address unforeseen events like the current Ebola outbreak without affecting ongoing health efforts. Currently, USAID is reprogramming funds planned for preventing future outbreaks to address the Ebola outbreak, as well as other ongoing outbreaks. According to USAID, funds are being reprogrammed to address the current Ebola outbreak, as well as other ongoing outbreaks like H7N9 avian influenza in China and MERS-CoV in the Middle East. Supporters view the appropriation structure as a way to oversee health programs, while opponents argue that congressional directives limit agility in the field and impact of health efforts. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable by nature. Opponents argue that congressional directives limit agility in the field and impact of health efforts, creating artificial segmentation of health and development issues. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with appropriate surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be minimized. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and now West Africa due to the emergence of Ebola. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and now West Africa due to the emergence of Ebola. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is $50 million, which is 30% less than the FY2014 funding level of $73 million. This decrease in funding may hinder preparedness for potential outbreaks in the affected regions. Another EVD outbreak may occur in West Africa, where affected countries may be ill-prepared to handle it. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is $50 million, 30% less than the FY2014 funding level of $73 million. Even if Congress funds USAID pandemic preparedness programs at the FY2014 level, it may not be enough to meet current demands. Experts predict the outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing disruptions in social structures with potential long-term effects in the region. MSF reports villages in Sierra Leone have lost most adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns arise about growing number of Ebola orphans, who are particularly vulnerable to marginalization due to fear. The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone has left many villages without adult community members, impacting vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. Concerns are rising about the increasing number of Ebola orphans, who are at risk of marginalization due to fear of the virus. This adds to the existing orphan population in West and Central Africa, which was already significant due to causes like armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has led to a significant increase in orphan populations, with over 4 million children losing one or more parents to AIDS in 2012. Experts are concerned that the outbreak is hindering the governments' capacity to address health issues like obstetrical complications, leading to a rise in child and maternal mortality rates. Experts are worried that the Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa is impacting the governments' ability to address health issues like obstetrical complications, leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates. The full health effects of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained, potentially sparking a debate on the allocation of U.S. global health assistance funds. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa is impacting governments' ability to address health issues like obstetrical complications, leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates. The full health effects of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained, sparking a potential debate on the allocation of U.S. global health assistance funds. Congress may face arguments from advocates for various health and development issues worsened by Ebola, including maternal and child mortality, child vulnerability, poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections. Therapeutic options for Ebola outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa remain limited. Several Ebola outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa since 1976, with no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine available. Advocates are seeking support for health and development issues worsened by Ebola, such as maternal and child mortality, child vulnerability, poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to improve survival rates. Therapeutic options for Ebola in sub-Saharan Africa are limited, with no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine available. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to improve survival rates, sparking debate over equity in access to these resources. The debate over the appropriate use of experimental drugs in clinical trials for Ebola treatment raises ethical concerns about equity and safety testing in humans. The debate over the use of experimental drugs in Ebola treatment raises ethical concerns about equity and safety testing in humans. WHO announced it is ethical to offer unproven interventions under certain conditions, despite the potential risks of exacerbating mistrust in healthcare workers and modern medical treatments. WHO announced in August that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions for Ebola treatment. They planned to test two vaccines on 20,000 volunteers in January and provide experimental treatment in Liberia by early November. In October, WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. An experimental treatment might be available in Liberia by early November. A meeting was held to fast track testing and deployment of vaccines to impact the Ebola epidemic, leading to potential ethical debates during the trials. A meeting was held with government representatives, partners, and stakeholders to fast track testing and deployment of Ebola vaccines. Ethical debates may arise during trials, especially if adverse reactions occur. WHO warned bordering countries of Ebola risk, with Mali reporting its first case on October 23, 2014. WHO warned bordering countries of Ebola risk, with Mali reporting its first case on October 23, 2014. Concerns about ethical practices may arise during vaccine trials, especially if adverse reactions occur. An Oxford University study found that 22 million people in Central and West Africa live in areas where fruit bats, a suspected Ebola vector, reside. WHO is assisting neighboring countries in developing EVD surveillance and response plans. The Oxford University study found that 22 million people in Central and West Africa live in forested areas where fruit bats, a suspected Ebola vector, reside. WHO is helping neighboring countries develop Ebola surveillance and response plans. Concerns are raised about future Ebola outbreaks in the region and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa due to changes in human mobility and connectivity. Urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness capacity are at risk for potential outbreaks. The Oxford University study found that 22 million people in Central and West Africa live in areas where fruit bats, a suspected Ebola vector, reside. Concerns are raised about future Ebola outbreaks in the region and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa due to changes in human mobility and connectivity. Questions are raised about the effectiveness of the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak and the support for pandemic preparedness efforts. The U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak and pandemic preparedness efforts are questioned. Reprogramming of USAID funds for Ebola may impact global health programs. Outbreak responses aim to improve affected countries' capacity for future outbreaks."
