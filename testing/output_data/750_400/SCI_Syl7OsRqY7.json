    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but recent studies suggest they assume answers and evidence are in close proximity in a single document. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a new model that combines evidence from multiple documents. It includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with respect to the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module that scores candidate answers by comparing their occurrences across all documents with the query. These modules use hierarchies of coattention and self-attention to learn. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) combines evidence from multiple documents using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention. It achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, outperforming previous models by 3% accuracy. The CFC achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, outperforming previous models by 3% accuracy. The system combines evidence from multiple documents using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention. Question answering systems focus on reasoning over localized sections of a single document, but multi-evidence QA requires aggregating evidence from multiple documents. In multi-evidence question answering, the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) model selects answers by aggregating evidence from multiple documents. The model combines coarse-grain reasoning and fine-grain reasoning to build a summary of support documents based on the query. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) model combines coarse-grain reasoning and fine-grain reasoning to select answers by aggregating evidence from multiple documents. The model builds a summary of support documents based on the query and matches specific fine-grain contexts to gauge the relevance of the candidate answers. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) model uses two strategies of reasoning - coarse-grain and fine-grain modules. It employs hierarchical attention to combine information from support documents based on the query and candidates. The CFC achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy.

The CFC achieved a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy, surpassing the previous best by 3%. It improved exact match accuracy by 3.1% and F1 by 3.0% on the TriviaQA multi-paragraph question answering task. The attention hierarchies of the coarse and fine-grain modules learn to focus on distinct parts of the input, enabling the CFC to represent long documents effectively. Common types of errors produced by CFC are outlined. The CFC, developed by Gardner in 2018, improves accuracy on various tasks. The attention hierarchies of its modules focus on different parts of the input, aiding in representing long documents effectively. Errors in the CFC are attributed to challenges in aggregating references, noise in supervision, and complex relation types. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules correspond to different reasoning strategies. The CFC generates errors due to challenges in aggregating references, noise in supervision, and complex relation types. It consists of coarse-grain and fine-grain modules that employ different reasoning strategies. The coarse-grain module summarizes support documents using coattention and self-attention, while the fine-grain module retrieves specific contexts for each candidate by identifying coreferent mentions and building codependent representations. The model consists of coarse-grain and fine-grain modules that use different reasoning strategies to summarize support documents and retrieve specific contexts for each candidate. The attention hierarchies in each module focus on different parts of the input, allowing the model to effectively represent a large number of potentially long support documents. The model consists of coarse-grain and fine-grain modules that use different reasoning strategies to build codependent representations between mentions and the query. This division of labor allows attention hierarchies in each module to focus on different parts of the input, enabling effective representation of a large number of potentially long support documents. The model utilizes coarse-grain and fine-grain modules with attention hierarchies to represent mentions and the query effectively, handling a large number of lengthy support documents. It encodes sequences using bidirectional GRUs and projects query parameters for encoding. The model utilizes coarse-grain and fine-grain modules with attention hierarchies to represent mentions and the query effectively, handling a large number of lengthy support documents. It encodes sequences using bidirectional GRUs and projects query parameters for encoding. The CFC's coarse-grain module builds codependent representations of support documents and the query using coattention, then summarizes the context using self-attention to compare it to the candidate. The CFC model utilizes parameters q and b for query projection, with d_hid representing the size of the bidirectional GRU. Coattention is used to build codependent representations of support documents and the query, followed by self-attention to compare with the candidate. Affinity matrix computation and summary vector definitions are key components in this process. Coattention is essential for single-document question answering models. The affinity matrix is computed between the document and query, with support and query summary vectors defined using softmax normalization. The document context is obtained through coattention, which concatenates the document context and summary vector. The coattention context is obtained by concatenating the document context and summary vector. Hierarchical self-attention is then used to summarize the coattention context, creating a fixed-length summary vector. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention, creating a fixed-length summary vector by computing scores for each position and computing a weighted sum over the context. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention with a two-layer MLP to compute scores for each position and a weighted sum over the context. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention with a two-layer MLP to compute scores for each position and a weighted sum over the context. Parameters W 2 , b 2 , W 1 , and b 1 are used for the MLP scorer. The summary is produced based on the query and support documents, and a fixed-length summary vector is computed for all support documents. This summary is then multiplied with the candidate answer summary to generate a coarse-grain score. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention with a two-layer MLP to compute scores for each position and a weighted sum over the context. A fixed-length summary vector of all support documents is computed and multiplied with the candidate answer summary to generate a coarse-grain score. The fine-grain module, shown in Figure 3, finds the specific context in the support documents. The encoding and self-attention summary of the candidate are represented by E c and G c. W coarse and b coarse are parameters of a projection layer that reduces support documents summary. The fine-grain module uses coreference resolution to find specific context in supporting documents. Mention representations are formed using a self-attention layer, and coattention between mention representations and the query is computed. The fine-grain module utilizes coreference resolution to identify specific context in supporting documents. Mention representations are created using self-attention, and coattention between mentions and the query is calculated. This coattention context is summarized via self-attention to generate a detailed summary for scoring the candidate.

Mention representations are created using self-attention, and coattention between mentions and the query is calculated. This coattention context is summarized via self-attention to generate a detailed summary for scoring the candidate. The mentions of the candidate in the support document are represented using self-attention over the span of the support document encoding. The candidate mentions in the support document are represented using self-attention. Mention representations are used to calculate coattention context and summary with respect to the query. Fine-grain scores for the candidate are determined using a linear layer, and the final score is a combination of coarse-grain and fine-grain scores. The model extracts mention representations using self-attention and calculates coattention context and summary with respect to the query. Fine-grain scores for candidates are determined using a linear layer, and the final score is a combination of coarse-grain and fine-grain scores.

(2018) facilitates multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base. This dataset creates a bipartite graph of documents and entities, with knowledge base fact triplets corresponding to paths in the graph. The support documents for a fact triplet are the documents along this path. The Qangaroo WikiHop task links entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base, creating a bipartite graph. Fact triplets correspond to paths in the graph, with support documents being the documents along these paths. Given a query, the task involves selecting plausible candidate objects and their corresponding support documents. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves selecting the correct candidate answer from a set of plausible candidates based on a query, support documents, and fact triplets. The task uses both masked and unmasked versions to evaluate candidate answers. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves selecting the correct candidate answer from a set of plausible candidates based on a query and support documents. The unmasked version represents candidate answers with original text, while the masked version uses placeholders to remove correlation between frequent answers and support documents. Official blind test evaluation is done using the unmasked version. Tokenization is done using Stanford CoreNLP, and models are trained using ADAM. Detailed experiment setup and hyperparameters are listed.

The division of labour between the coarse-grain and fine-grain modules is also highlighted. The experiment setup achieved a new best accuracy of 70.6%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art result by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The division of labour between the coarse-grain and fine-grain modules allows for more effective modeling of long documents in WikiHop. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules in the CFC enable attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input, improving modeling of long documents in WikiHop. The model's effectiveness is further studied on TriviaQA by decomposing the task into proposing candidate answers and reranking them. Ablation study results on the WikiHop dev set are shown in Table 3. In 2017, a large-scale question answering dataset called TriviaQA was decomposed into two subtasks: proposing candidate answers and reranking them. An ablation study on the WikiHop dev set was conducted, showing the impact of different modules and techniques on the model's performance. The first subtask was addressed using BiDAF++, a competitive span extraction question answering model. The study addressed two subtasks: removing modules and techniques to improve performance. BiDAF++ was used for the first subtask, while the CFC was used for the second subtask. Reranking with the CFC showed consistent performance gains over using only the span. The study utilized BiDAF++ for the first subtask and the CFC for the second subtask. Reranking with the CFC resulted in consistent performance improvements over using only the span extraction question answering model.

Both coarse-grain and fine-grain modules contribute significantly to model performance. The CFC can refine outputs from span extraction question answering models. Both coarse-grain and fine-grain modules contribute significantly to model performance. Replacing self-attention layers with mean-pooling and bidirectional GRUs with unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation. Replacing the encoder with a projection over word embeddings leads to a significant performance drop, highlighting the importance of contextual encodings capturing positional information.

Replacing the encoder with a projection over word embeddings leads to a significant performance drop, emphasizing the importance of contextual encodings capturing positional information. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model in coreference resolution. The distribution of model prediction errors across various dataset lengths shows that the fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model in coreference resolution. However, the fine-grain-only model performs better on examples with a large number of support documents or long support documents. This is likely due to entity-matching techniques used. The entity-matching coreference resolution technique used in the fine-grain-only model outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on examples with many or lengthy support documents. This is because it captures intra-document and inter-document dependencies more precisely than hierarchical attention. The entity-matching coreference resolution technique captures intra-document and inter-document dependencies more precisely than hierarchical attention.

Various question answering models have been developed, including document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, and cross-sequence attention models. Recent developments in question answering models have been driven by large-scale QA datasets, leading to the creation of end-to-end QA models such as document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, and cross-sequence attention models. These models include variations like match-LSTM, coattention, bidirectional attention, and query-context attention. Reinforcement learning is also being used to encourage exploration of close answers.
