    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on short title, findings, public education campaign, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, especially among children and young adults. Up to 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but struggle to find a suitable match. Leukemia causes more deaths than any other cancer among children and young adults under 20. Up to 16,000 leukemia patients each year need a bone marrow transplant but often struggle to find a suitable match. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in treatment. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in the treatment of various blood diseases. Cord blood cells have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, providing a rich source of stem cells for transplantation. Cord blood cells have been effectively used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for allogeneic transplantation, especially for children, with lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Additionally, cord blood cells have been used to treat nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Cord blood cells have lower rates of graft versus host disease than bone marrow and are easier to match based on HLA typing. They have been used to effectively treat nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiencies, and leukodystrophies. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells, which are the building blocks of bones, the heart, liver, and nervous system. Cord blood cells have been found to contain various types of stem cells that can differentiate into every cell type in the human body. They also have the ability to decrease inflammation and stimulate tissue repair. Clinical research and experimental clinical use are ongoing to explore their potential benefits. Cord blood cells are pluripotent and can differentiate into any cell type in the body. They have shown to decrease inflammation and promote tissue repair. Clinical research is being conducted to use these cells for treating type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. Research is underway to study the use of autologous cord blood cells to treat various conditions such as type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. Over 90% of cord blood cells from more than 4,000,000 births in the US are discarded as medical waste. Less than a quarter of states require expectant parents to receive information about banking cord blood in public or private banks. In the United States, over 90% of cord blood cells from 4,000,000 births are discarded annually as medical waste. Less than a quarter of states mandate that expectant parents receive information about banking cord blood in public or private banks. The Institute of Medicine recommended clear information provision to donors regarding their cord blood banking options in 2005. The Institute of Medicine recommended in 2005 that donors should be provided with clear and balanced information about their options for banking cord blood cells, including obtaining informed consent before labor and delivery. The Institute of Medicine recommended in 2005 that donors should be provided with clear and balanced information about their options for banking cord blood cells, including obtaining informed consent before labor and delivery. Informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery, after adequate disclosure of information. The public education campaign is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will explain the value and uses of cord blood for individuals, regardless of biological relation, and the differences in using it. The publication on umbilical cord blood will explain its potential value and uses for individuals, regardless of biological relation, differences between autologous and allogeneic use in treatment, public vs. private cord blood banking, and options available to mothers regarding stem cells. The publication discusses the use of umbilical cord blood for treating diseases, differences between public and private cord blood banking, and options for mothers to donate or store stem cells. After delivery, options for umbilical cord blood cells include donating to a public bank, storing in a private bank for family use, or storing for family members in need through a donor banking program. Options for umbilical cord blood cells include donating to a public bank, storing in a private bank for family use, or storing for family members in need through a donor banking program. This involves collecting cord blood, considering medical or family history criteria, and deciding whether to discard the stem cells. The curr_chunk discusses the medical processes involved in collecting cord blood, criteria affecting a family's decision on umbilical cord blood banking, options for ownership and future use of donated cord blood, and the average cost of public and private cord blood banking. It also mentions the availability of public and private cord blood banks. The curr_chunk provides information on the availability of public and private cord blood banks, including a list of public cord blood banks in the US, accredited private cord blood banks, and the availability of free family banking. The curr_chunk explains the need for publicly donated cord blood samples among specific racial and ethnic groups based on medical data from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The curr_chunk introduces the requirement for a patient informed consent document. The Secretary must develop a patient informed consent document on cord blood disposition within a year of this Act. The document will cover options for cord blood banking and the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment. The document developed under subsection (a) shall include information on different options for cord blood banking, the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment, and a declaration of a woman's chosen option for cord blood stem cells disposition. SEC. 5. Duty of certain professionals to disclose information and obtain consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must inform pregnant women about umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester or at the first visit. They should also provide this information at least 2 weeks before the estimated due date. Healthcare professionals must inform pregnant women about umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester or at the first visit. They should also provide this information at least 2 weeks before the estimated due date and obtain written informed consent regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells. Healthcare professionals must inform pregnant women about cord blood banking options before the third trimester or first visit. Written informed consent is required for cord blood stem cell disposition. Medicaid regulations under the Social Security Act have been amended to include these requirements. Medicaid regulations under the Social Security Act have been amended to require that healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women must inform them about cord blood banking options before the third trimester or first visit. Written informed consent is needed for cord blood stem cell disposition. The Medicaid regulations now require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to inform them about cord blood banking options before the third trimester or first visit. Written consent is necessary for cord blood stem cell disposition. Additionally, physicians or health care professionals receiving funds for prenatal care must comply with these requirements and have a method to enforce them. The Medicaid regulations require healthcare professionals providing prenatal care to pregnant women to inform them about cord blood banking options before the third trimester or first visit.
