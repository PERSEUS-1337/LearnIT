Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the US, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report shows that large truck crashes are 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. The number of fatalities from these crashes is a significant portion of all crash fatalities. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes in the US. From 2001 to 2005, there were 25,533 large truck-related fatalities in the country. In 2005, large truck-related crashes caused 5,212 deaths and 114,000 injuries in the US. From 2001 to 2005, there were a total of 25,533 fatalities. These crashes also have a significant economic impact, costing society $230.6 billion annually. The economic cost of highway crashes in the US is significant, with the Department of Transportation estimating it at $230.6 billion annually. A report by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration found that crashes involving trucks over 10,000 pounds have an estimated cost of $91,112 each, with fatal crashes costing $3,604,518 on average. Vehicle suppliers and manufacturers are investing in research and innovative design to improve safety. The estimated cost of crashes involving trucks over 10,000 pounds is $91,112, with fatal crashes costing $3,604,518 on average. Investments in advanced safety systems by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to mitigate commercial vehicle crash scenarios. Motorcoach manufacturers have developed new advanced safety systems and technologies to address commercial vehicle crash scenarios. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce the traffic fatality rate, and the deployment of these technologies can help achieve this goal. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce the traffic fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million vehicle miles traveled by 2011. Accelerated deployment of advanced safety technologies on commercial vehicles can help achieve this goal and reduce injuries and fatalities on the roads. Congress supports increasing the deployment of these technologies to mitigate the societal cost of crashes. Congress supports increasing the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to reduce injuries and fatalities on the roads and highways, ultimately mitigating the societal cost of crashes. The IRS Code is amended to include a new section providing a tax credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems. The new IRS Code section offers a tax credit of 50% of the cost of qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems placed in service, with a limit of $1,500 per system and $3,500 per vehicle.

The term 'brake stroke monitoring system' refers to an onboard monitoring system. The term 'brake stroke monitoring system' refers to an onboard monitoring system for air-braked vehicles that uses electronic sensors to detect brake issues and alerts the driver. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of different safety systems for vehicles, including a brake monitoring system, lane departure warning system, and collision warning system. The brake monitoring system uses electronic sensors to detect brake issues and alert the driver, while the lane departure warning system alerts the driver of unintended lane movements, and the collision warning system warns of potential collisions. The curr_chunk defines safety systems for vehicles, including lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems. Lane departure warns of unintended lane movements, collision warning alerts of potential collisions. The curr_chunk defines collision warning and vehicle stability systems as safety features that alert drivers of potential collision risks and intervene to prevent rollovers or instability. The curr_chunk explains that a stability system is an active safety feature that intervenes to prevent rollovers or instability by adjusting vehicle speed or applying brakes.
