The international investment activity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is raising concerns over economic and security implications, with an estimated 22% of the world's largest 100 firms effectively under state control. Policymakers worry about preferential treatment given to SOEs, potentially providing a competitive edge in overseas activities. According to the OECD, 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are effectively under state control, raising concerns about preferential treatment given to SOEs that may create anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. This association could provide firms with market protection and access to below-market financing, giving them a competitive advantage. Some policymakers are concerned about the close associations between firms and governments in overseas activities, which may lead to anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. This could blur the distinction between firms operating purely for commercial reasons and those working towards a foreign government's public policy goals.

The performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to U.S.-owned ones shows a mixed picture, with historically lower rates of return for foreign-owned firms. However, the gap between the two groups has narrowed over time, possibly due to age effects or costs associated with establishing a new business. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the United States have lower rates of return compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time. This improvement may be due to age effects and startup costs that diminish over time. Despite accounting for less than 3% of all U.S. manufacturing establishments, foreign-owned firms have significantly higher value added and performance metrics.

Concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and public perception of foreign investment may influence this trend.

Concerns about foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy focus on potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions, regardless of the acquiring company's origin. These concerns are partially offset by perceived benefits such as capital inflow and the creation of new jobs in local areas. Opposition to some types of foreign direct investment also stems from concerns about its impact on U.S. economic and national security interests. Despite concerns about job losses, foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy is driven by perceived benefits like capital inflow and job creation. National security concerns have arisen, especially post-9/11, but have not deterred foreign investors. The U.S. remains a top destination for foreign direct investment.
