Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15th each year with the assessor. Approval of property tax exemptions is contingent upon the claimant obtaining an organizational clearance certificate. Financial statements are to be provided only upon request by the assessor. The assessor must review property tax exemption claims only after the claimant obtains an organizational clearance certificate. Financial statements are required only if requested. The assessor reviews claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure they meet specific requirements. The assessor may audit the operations of the property owner to ensure compliance with exemption requirements, including justifying capital investments for expansion and verifying the property is used for exempt activities. The assessor may conduct an audit to verify if the property owner meets exemption requirements. The assessor has the authority to deny a welfare exemption claim even if an organizational clearance certificate has been granted. If the property is found ineligible for exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing. If the assessor determines that the property is ineligible for the exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing. The claimant can then seek a refund of property taxes by filing a refund claim with the county, and if denied, may file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption for property exempted under specific sections is not required to reapply if there are no changes and the property is used by a governmental entity or nonprofit. Notification must be given if eligibility is lost or property ownership changes before February 15. The applicant granted a welfare exemption must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible or if the property no longer meets exemption requirements. Prior to the lien date, the assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application. The notice, in a prescribed form, will detail circumstances where the property may lose exemption eligibility and remind applicants to inform the assessor if the property is no longer eligible. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances where the property may lose exemption eligibility. The notice informs applicants how to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption and warns that failure to do so may result in additional contact by the assessor. Upon indication of incorrectly granted exemptions, the assessor will reevaluate eligibility and cancel any exemptions no longer valid. If a welfare or veterans' organization exemption on the property is incorrectly allowed, an escape assessment will be made for the amount of the exemption, with interest and a penalty of 10% of the escape assessment, not exceeding $250, for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended.

Every application for property assessment review must be filed with the assessor and the board shall provide notice and a hearing. Failure to file timely application will result in no relief under Section 11 of Article XIII or this section. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended.
