It has a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism and is analytically tractable for optimal compression. Formulated as a hierarchical conditional generative model, the memory combines top-down and bottom-up processes to improve generative models on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Our memory model, formulated as a hierarchical conditional generative model, combines top-down memory and bottom-up perception to improve generative models on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. The adaptive memory significantly enhances model performance compared to the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and its variants, with greater capacity and ease of training. Our memory model, with greater capacity and ease of training than the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and its variants, explores novel ways to efficiently use memory in neural networks. The slot-based external memory in models like DNCs often limits information sharing across memory slots, requiring additional slots for storage. Efficient memory usage in neural networks is still a challenge. Models like Differentiable Neural Computers collapse reading and writing into single slots, limiting information sharing. Other models store data embeddings directly, leading to memory volume increase with the number of samples. In contrast, the Neural Statistician summarizes datasets efficiently. Memory slots need to be expanded for new inputs, even if redundant. Matching Networks BID25 BID4 and Neural Episodic Controller BID21 store data embeddings, requiring memory to grow with stored samples. In contrast, Neural Statistician BID7 summarizes datasets by averaging embeddings, potentially losing information. Associative memory architectures offer insights for memory design.

This memory architecture extends the variational autoencoder (VAE) by deriving the prior from an adaptive memory store. Our proposal introduces a memory system for online distributed writing, offering effective compression and storage of complex data. The memory architecture extends the variational autoencoder (VAE) by using an adaptive memory store for the prior distribution. The VAE has observable variable x and latent variable z, with generative model parameters denoted as \u03b8 and inference model parameters as \u03c6. The variational autoencoder (VAE) has observable variable x and latent variable z. The generative model is defined by prior distribution p \u03b8 (z) and conditional distribution p \u03b8 (x|z), with intractable posterior p \u03b8 (z|x) approximated by inference model q \u03c6 (z|x). Parameterised distributions are implemented as multivariate Gaussian distributions. The objective is to maximize the VAE's training on a dataset D = {x 1 , . . . , x n , . . . , x N }. The VAE's objective is to maximize log-likelihood by optimizing parameters for a variational lower-bound. This includes minimizing the negative reconstruction loss for reconstructing x using its approximated posterior sample from q \u03c6 (z|x). The objective of training a VAE is to maximize log-likelihood by optimizing parameters for a variational lower-bound.

The equality utilizes the conditional independence of data points given memory M, factorizing the joint distribution into marginal distribution and posterior for efficient computation. Maximizing mutual information between memory and episode is key for memory-based generative models. The joint distribution of the generative model can be factorized to maximize mutual information between memory and episode, forming a principled way for memory-based generative models. The joint distribution of the generative model can be factorized to maximize mutual information between memory and episode, utilizing a memory M with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution. The memory M is a K \u00d7 C random matrix with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution, showing conditional independence of z t, y t, x t given M. The distribution is equivalent to the multivariate Gaussian distribution of vectorised M. Independence is assumed between columns but not rows of M, with V fixed to the identity matrix I C and full degree of freedom for U. The memory distribution of matrix M is equivalent to a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with independence between columns but not rows. The addresses A are a K \u00d7 S matrix optimized through back-propagation, with normalized rows to avoid degeneracy. The addresses A, a K \u00d7 S matrix, are optimized through back-propagation and normalized to avoid degeneracy. The addressing variable y t computes weights for memory access, with a learned projection transforming it into a key vector. The weights across rows of matrix M are computed using a projection function. In the context of optimizing addresses A through back-propagation and normalization to avoid degeneracy, the addressing variable y t is used to compute weights for memory access. A learned projection transforms y t into a key vector, and weights across rows of matrix M are computed using a projection function implemented as a multi-layer perception (MLP). The code z t generates samples of x t through a parametrized conditional distribution. The projection f implemented as a multi-layer perception transforms the distribution of y t and w t to non-Gaussian distributions. The code z t generates samples of x t through a conditional distribution tied for all t \u2208 {1 . . . T }. The memory dependent prior for z t results in a richer marginal distribution due to its dependence on memory. The distribution of z t is memory-dependent, with a prior that is a linear combination of memory rows. This results in a richer marginal distribution, capturing local statistics within an episode. The hierarchical model includes a global latent variable M for capturing episode statistics, while local latent variables y t and z t capture local statistics within an episode. The reading inference model uses a factorized posterior distribution with conditional independence. The reading inference model approximates the posterior distribution using conditional independence, refining the prior distribution with additional evidence. The parameterized posterior takes input from x t and the mean of the prior distribution. The constant variance is omitted, and the parameterized posterior is shared for all samples. The parameterized posterior distribution q \u03c6 (z t |x t , y t , M ) refines the prior distribution p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M ) with additional evidence from x t, balancing the trade-off between preserving old information and writing new information optimally through Bayes' rule.

The update rule for memory involves matrices \u03a3 c, \u03a3 \u03be, and \u03a3 z to encode covariance and cross-covariance information. The prior parameters of p(M), R 0 and U 0, are trained through back-propagation, allowing the prior of M to learn the general dataset structure while the posterior adapts to features in a subset of data. The main computational cost comes from inverting \u03a3 z.

The main cost in the update rule is inverting \u03a3 z with a complexity of O(T^3). Storing and multiplying the memory's row-covariance matrix U is another major cost with a complexity of O(K^2). The covariance can be restricted to diagonal to reduce the cost to O(K), but experiments show it is useful for coordinating memory access. Future work includes investigating low-rank approximation of U for better cost-performance balance during training. To reduce the cost of inverting \u03a3 z, experiments suggest using the covariance for coordinating memory access. Future work involves exploring low-rank approximation of U to balance cost and performance during training by optimizing a variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood. To train the model, a variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood is optimized. Sampling is done to approximate the inner expectation for computational efficiency. Mean-field approximation is used for memory, and analytical tractability of the Gaussian distribution is exploited for reading and writing operations.

This process utilizes knowledge about memory to enhance reading, suggesting the use of q \u03c6 (y t |x t , M ) instead of q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) for addressing. Training a parameterized model with the whole matrix M as input can be costly due to intractable posteriors that arise in non-tree graphs.

The Kanerva Machine showed improved reconstruction and KL-divergence, with a sharp dip in KL-divergence around the 2000th step indicating the model learned to use memory for a more informative prior. This rich prior comes at the cost of additional KL-divergence for y t, which is still lower than the KL-divergence for z t in a VAE. Similar training curves were observed for CIFAR training. The VAE achieved a negative log-likelihood of \u2264 112.7 at the end of training, which is worse than the state-of-the-art.

Our model generalizes Kanerva's memory model to continuous, non-uniform data and integrates with deep neural networks for modern machine learning. It adapts quickly to new data in episode-based learning, unlike other models that do not update memory following learning. The BID19 model used attention to retrieve information from a memory matrix, but the memory is not updated following learning, unlike our model which quickly adapts to new data in episode-based learning. BID5 used discrete random variables to address an external memory, storing images as raw pixels for fast adaptation. Our model improves on BID5 by learning to store information in a compressed form using statistical regularity in images, encoder at the perceptual level, learned addresses, and Bayes' rule for memory updates. Efficient memory updating is crucial for an effective memory model. Our model efficiently stores information in a compressed form by leveraging statistical regularity in images, using an encoder at the perceptual level, learned addresses, and Bayes' rule for memory updates. The model employs an exact Bayes' update-rule without compromising neural network flexibility. Our model combines classical statistical models with neural networks to efficiently update memory using an exact Bayes' update-rule. This approach shows promising performance and scalability, suggesting a new direction for memory models in machine learning. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory is reviewed in this section, with notations modified for consistency with the paper. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model combines classical statistical models with neural networks for novel memory models in machine learning. It features distributed reading and writing operations with fixed addresses pointing to a modifiable memory. The model's components include a table of addresses A and memory M, both of size K \u00d7 D. Kanerva assumes inputs are uniform random vectors y \u2208 {\u22121, 1} D. Kanerva's memory model involves distributed reading and writing operations with fixed addresses pointing to a modifiable memory. The addresses and memory have the same size of K \u00d7 D, where K is the number of addresses and D is the input dimensionality. Inputs are compared with addresses through Hamming distance, calculated as h(a, b) = 1/2(D - a \u00b7 b). In Kanerva's memory model, random vectors are used as fixed addresses to point to a modifiable memory. The Hamming distance is calculated between inputs and addresses to select the closest address. The selected addresses are used to store and retrieve information from memory. In Kanerva's memory model, addresses are selected based on the hamming distance between input vectors and fixed random vectors. The selected addresses are used to store and retrieve information from memory using a binary weight vector. The reading process involves summing the memory contents pointed to by selected addresses to produce an output, which can be iterated multiple times. Kanerva's model ensures sparse and distributed operations when both the number of addresses (K) and the dimensionality of the vectors (D) are large enough. In Kanerva's memory model, addresses are selected based on hamming distance between input vectors and random vectors. The reading process involves summing memory contents to produce an output, which can be iterated multiple times.

Kanerva's memory model ensures sparse and distributed operations, allowing for correct retrieval of stored vectors even with over-written content. It can also discover significantly corrupted queries through iterative reading. However, the model's application is limited by the assumption of uniform and binary data distribution, which is rarely true in real-world scenarios. This hinders its performance in neural network implementations optimized for floating-point numbers.

The differentiable neural computer (DNC) is integrated with the Kanerva memory interface for a fair comparison. The DNC receives addressing variable y t and input z t during writing, with separated reading and writing stages in experiments. During writing, the read-out is discarded, keeping the state as memory; during reading, the state is discarded at each step to prevent its use. In experiments with the differentiable neural computer (DNC) integrated with the Kanerva memory interface, a 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity is used as the controller instead of LSTM to prevent interference with DNC's external memory. The writing process discards the read-out from the DNC, keeping its state as memory, while the reading process discards the state at each step to avoid storing new information.

To prevent interference with DNC's external memory, the controller avoids using LSTM. The writing process discards the read-out from the DNC to keep its state as memory, while the reading process avoids storing new information by discarding the state at each step. Additionally, to focus on memory performance, the controller output is removed to ensure that the DNC only reads-out from its memory. The controller output is removed to ensure that the DNC only reads-out from its memory, avoiding confusion in the auto-encoding setting. The focus is on memory performance, with tests showing the importance of covariance between memory rows. The importance of covariance between memory rows is highlighted in the test results of models using full and diagonal covariance matrices. The models with full covariance matrices showed faster decrease in test loss despite being slightly slower per-iteration. The bottom-up stream in the model compensates for memory by directly sampling z t from p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M ). During CIFAR training, the models using full covariance matrices were slightly slower per-iteration but showed a faster decrease in test loss.

The bottom-up stream in the model compensates for memory by directly sampling z t from p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M) for the decoder, forcing reconstruction solely using read-outs from the memory. The relatively small difference in KL-divergence significantly influences sample quality, with the advantage of the Kanerva Machine over the VAE increasing. Eq. 6 defines a linear Gaussian model for the joint distribution. The general patterns of the curves in Fig. 2 are similar. The small difference in KL-divergence greatly impacts sample quality, with the Kanerva Machine outperforming the VAE. Eq. 6 defines a linear Gaussian model for the joint distribution, and the posterior distribution can be derived using the conditional formula for the Gaussian. The main paper discusses the joint distribution of vectors Z and M using Gaussian distributions. The posterior distribution of M given Z is derived using the Kronecker product property. The update rule is presented in equations 9 to 11. The model utilizes samples from q\u03c6(z|x) for writing to memory and mean-field approximation for reading.
