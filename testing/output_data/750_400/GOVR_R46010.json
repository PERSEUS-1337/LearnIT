    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized in large power plants. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Customer-sited generation, a form of distributed generation, can be located on various properties. Net metering, encouraged by Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, allows electric energy generated on-site to offset energy provided by the utility. State net metering policies are relevant to discussions on renewable energy. State net metering policies are relevant to congressional discussions about the role of renewable energy sources, like solar, in the nation's electricity system. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is the most commonly deployed energy type participating in net metering, comprising 97% of net metering capacity in 2018. Other federal and state policies may interact with net metering policies. Some Members of Congress are interested in how states have modified their net metering policies, including the impact on stakeholders and the deployment of solar energy sources. Recent state policy changes are expected to expand solar energy. The deployment pace of distributed solar energy sources and other types of DG may be influenced by how pricing interacts with net metering policies. Some Members of Congress are interested in recent state policy changes regarding net metering and their impact on stakeholders. Congress could potentially take action on state net metering policies depending on priorities. Changes in solar energy development are expected, with Congress having the option to restrict, encourage, or require modifications to state net metering policies. This report discusses current issues related to net metering policies, which determine how customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they provide to the grid. Net metering policies determine compensation for electricity delivered to the grid from distributed generation. Electricity generated is subtracted from consumption for billing, often referred to as \"the meter running backward.\" A net metering customer is compensated on a one-to-one basis for electricity purchased from the grid, with every unit of electricity generated subtracted from their consumption for billing purposes. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place, which provide financial support for distributed generation (DG) by compensating customers for electricity delivered to the grid at a predetermined value. Net metering policies in 45 states provide financial support for distributed generation by compensating customers for electricity delivered to the grid at a predetermined value. Some states offer alternatives to net energy metering, and in states without mandatory net metering, some utilities voluntarily provide the service. In April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place, requiring utilities to offer net metering to customers. Some policies include alternatives to net energy metering and predate EPACT05. In states without mandatory net metering, some utilities voluntarily offer the service. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, representing about 1% of electricity customers. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, representing about 1% of electricity customers. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018. Metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018, with net metering participation varying by state. Hawaii has the highest participation rate. According to EIA data, net metering participation varies by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies and average electricity prices. The participation rate in net metering varies by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies, average electricity prices, and solar resource quality. The design of state net metering policies and other state policies like renewable portfolio standards also play a role. Electricity ratemaking is the process of allocating total costs to customers incurred by utilities in producing and delivering electricity. Various complexities and local factors influence this process, with a focus on typical considerations for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities. Ratemaking involves allocating total costs to customers incurred by utilities in producing and delivering electricity. State regulators approve rates for investor-owned utilities to recover their costs through customer bills. Investor-owned utilities in a service territory own and operate the electricity system, including generation, transmission, and distribution. State regulators approve rates for utilities to recover costs from customers, including power plant operation, grid maintenance, and regular operating expenses. Investor-owned utilities set rates to cover costs such as power plant operation, grid maintenance, operating expenses, and programmatic costs like bill relief and public policy implementation. Rates are often based on volumetric rates. Investor-owned utilities set rates based on operating costs, programmatic costs, and return on investments. Rates are typically established as volumetric rates, where all customers within a customer class pay the same rate per kilowatt-hour. Customers' bills vary monthly based on their electricity consumption. The volumetric rates, also known as flat rates, are set for all customers within a specific customer class, with the cost expressed in cents per kilowatt-hour. Customers' bills fluctuate monthly depending on their electricity usage, allowing the utility to recover its total costs across all customer classes. This cost-sharing model includes expenses for electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and other utility services. The utility sets volumetric rates for all customer classes to recover total costs, including electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. Customer charges for services like billing are separate from the electricity rate and appear as a fixed value on the bill. Customer charges, sometimes separate from electricity rates, appear as fixed values on bills and do not change monthly. These charges are in addition to volumetric rates based on kWh consumed. Some high-consuming customer classes may have special system modifications with costs recovered through demand charges, paid only by those customers. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering, but did not specify customer compensation methods. States with net metering have varied approaches, with many revising their policies in recent years. States with net metering have different approaches in implementing their policies, and many have revised their compensation methods in recent years. These decisions can impact distributed generation (DG) markets by influencing the value proposition for customers investing in DG. Approaches to implementing net metering can impact DG markets by influencing the value proposition for customers. States commonly compensate net metering customers at the utility's approved retail rate of electricity, known as net energy metering (NEM) policy. State policymakers initially viewed the retail rate as a \"close-enough proxy\" for rate. Net metering compensates customers at the utility's retail rate of electricity. Initially seen as a simple approach, policymakers assumed the retail rate was a proxy for the value of solar or DG. Initially, policymakers viewed net metering as a simple way to compensate customers at the retail rate, assuming it was a close proxy for the value of solar or DG. The small number of participants and energy quantities credited at retail price minimized errors in estimating true value. The small number of participating customers and kilowatt hours credited at retail price minimized errors in estimating the true value of solar or DG. Retail rates compensate net metering generation at a relatively high level due to reflecting the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation, reflecting the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. This encourages participation in net metering as customers can recover upfront costs of a DG system quickly. However, compensating at retail rates may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers. Retail rates may encourage net metering participation more than other compensation approaches as customers can recover upfront costs of a DG system quickly. However, compensating net metering customers at the retail rate may result in increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. Net metering customers reduce utility costs by generating their own electricity, but may still rely on grid services, leading to increased costs for non-net metering customers. This cost shift arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers. Net metering customers reduce utility costs by generating their own electricity, but may still rely on grid services, leading to increased costs for non-net metering customers. This cost shift arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers. Additionally, residential net metering customers tend to have higher incomes than non-net metering customers. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers having higher incomes than non-net metering customers. Studies disagree on whether non-net metering customers are cross-subsidizing net metering customers due to different methodologies used in estimating cross-subsidies. Studies have used different methodologies to estimate cross-subsidies between net metering and non-net metering customers, leading to a lack of consensus on the extent of potential equity concerns. Local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies. One synthesis of estimates conducted around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer per year, with disagreements on the threshold for policy action. One synthesis of estimates around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer per year. Observers may disagree on the threshold for policy action, as net metering is just one factor affecting electricity rates. A 2017 study assessed various factors' rate effects, including net metering, energy efficiency, natural gas prices, renewable standards, and utility expenditures. The 2017 study assessed the rate effects of various factors on electricity rates, including net metering, energy efficiency, natural gas prices, state renewable portfolio standards, the federal Clean Power Plan, and utility capital expenditures. It found that distributed generation (DG) would likely cause rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers. The study on rate effects of distributed generation (DG) found potential increases of 0.03 to 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to up to 3.6 cents/kWh from other factors. Cost shifts may not indicate money transfer between net metering and non-net metering customers, depending on participation rates and regulatory decisions. Addressing cost shifts through ratemaking processes could be delayed due to inherent time lags, and cost shifts are not unique to DG. Cost shifts in distributed generation (DG) may occur depending on net metering participation rates and regulatory decisions. Delays in addressing these shifts through ratemaking processes are possible due to inherent time lags. Cost shifts are not exclusive to DG, and some states are moving towards more precise allocations of system costs and benefits for net metering customers. In state policy debates, addressing concerns about cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation is a key focus. States are exploring options like adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to mitigate cost shifting effects. Adding fixed charges to net metering customers' bills allows utilities to recover costs for grid maintenance and operation while preserving some advantages for compensating net metering customers at the retail rate. States are considering variations of this approach to address concerns about cross-subsidies in state policy debates. Some states are implementing fixed charges for net metering customers to recover grid maintenance costs. Proponents argue it reduces cost shifting and increases fairness, while opponents typically include solar advocates. Some utilities and advocates support compensating net metering customers at the retail rate, arguing it simplifies administration and is fair. Opponents, including the solar industry and environmental advocates, believe net metering promotes competition and societal benefits of distributed generation. Adding fixed charges may reduce cost shifting but could discourage distributed generation. Opponents of fixed charges for net metering include the solar industry and environmental advocates, who argue that it promotes competition and societal benefits of distributed generation. Determining accurate fixed charges reflecting net metering customers' grid use has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted alternative compensation rates to represent energy costs utilities avoid with net metering customers supplying their own energy. Determining a value for fixed charges that accurately reflects net metering customers' use of the grid has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted an avoided cost rate as an alternative compensation rate to represent the energy costs utilities avoid when net metering customers supply their own energy. An avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, primarily reflects costs associated with producing energy. It may be estimated by a regulator or through referral to wholesale electricity markets. The avoided cost rate reflects energy production costs and may include network upgrades for integrating distributed generation (DG), such as solar PV. It is usually lower than retail rates. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar (VOS) rate. Avoided cost rates are typically lower than retail rates. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar (VOS) rate, which considers societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design. Some states view reduced greenhouse gas emissions as a benefit of distributed solar PV. The value of solar (VOS) rate considers societal benefits like reduced air emissions associated with distributed solar PV. Solar advocates support including these benefits in net metering policy and rate design, with some states also recognizing reduced greenhouse gas emissions as a benefit. VOS rates are typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, and can potentially exceed retail rates depending on the perceived benefits of solar. This compensation rate applies to all distributed energy resources, not just solar generation. The value of solar (VOS) rate considers societal benefits like reduced air emissions associated with distributed solar PV. VOS rates are typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, and can potentially exceed retail rates depending on the perceived benefits of solar. New York is one state taking this approach for all distributed energy resources, not just solar generation. New York is one state that considers the value of solar (VOS) rate for all distributed energy resources, not just solar generation. The debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed energy resources includes which costs and benefits to consider, and how to quantify them, as costs and benefits of distributed generation can be time- and location-specific. States vary in their approach to this issue. The debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed energy resources includes considering costs and benefits, which can be time- and location-specific. States vary in their approach to evaluating net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis of 15 state studies. States have varying approaches to evaluating net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis of 15 state studies. Differences include net metering compensation, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership. The set of value categories and whether they represent costs or benefits significantly impact study results. State net metering policies differ in various aspects such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, which can affect deployment of DG. Program caps limit the number of customers or generation capacity that can participate. Program caps, also known as aggregate capacity limits, set restrictions on customer participation and generation capacity in state net metering policies. These caps can be defined in terms of power, percentage of electricity demand, or other measures, impacting the promotion of distributed generation. They are established to mitigate risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies. Program caps in state net metering policies can affect the promotion of distributed generation. They are set to reduce risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies, but may also hinder achieving renewable energy goals. States specify which generation sources can participate in net metering. Program caps in state net metering policies aim to reduce cross-subsidies and financial risks for utilities. However, they may impede renewable energy goals. States determine eligible generation sources based on capacity limits and technology type, with solar energy being dominant. Other energy types may participate based on cost and customer type. Net metering allows participation based on capacity limits and technology type, with solar energy being dominant. Non-solar projects may participate depending on cost factors, customer type, and location. For example, combined heat and power facilities attract large commercial and industrial customers, while distributed wind projects appeal to farms or customers with large acreage. Net metering customers, based on customer type and location, can deliver surplus generation to the grid. State net metering policies compensate customers for the total electricity generated. Net metering customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation for the total electricity generated. States have varying policies on how credits for surplus generation are handled. Some states compensate net metering customers for surplus electricity generated, with credits applied to the next bill. Credit retention policies vary among states, affecting customers' ability to reduce electricity costs to $0. Net metering often involves a single generator behind a single electricity meter, such as a rooftop solar installation on a single-family home. Aggregate net metering options are available in some states. Credit retention policies can impact customers' ability to reduce electricity costs to $0. Net metering can involve single generators behind a single electricity meter, like rooftop solar installations on single-family homes. Different arrangements are possible, including aggregate net metering for customers with multiple meters, and shared net metering for multiple customers with the same generation capacity, such as community solar projects. Aggregate net metering applies to single customers with multiple electricity meters on their property, such as farms, municipalities, or school districts. Shared net metering is for multiple customers with the same generation capacity, like community solar projects. Virtual net metering is a version of shared net metering for onsite projects, such as multi-family dwellings. Third party participation allows entities other than the electricity consumer to own the solar system. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation addressing states' net metering policies, including proposals that would limit state regulators' ability to move net metering customers to lower rates. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to influence state net metering policies, such as limiting regulators' ability to lower compensation rates or add fixed charges to bills. Other proposals include requiring regulators to consider cross-subsidies in net metering policies and encouraging states to adopt net billing policies for community solar. Some legislation introduced in Congress aims to influence state net metering policies, including requiring regulators to consider cross-subsidies and encouraging states to adopt net billing policies for community solar. Additionally, there are proposals for studies to better understand the costs and benefits of net metering, such as a DOE report requested by Congress on the topic. In the 116th Congress, legislation like S. 346 and H.R. 1009 would mandate studies by the National Academies on various aspects of net metering, including alternative incentives for distributed generation and consumer incentives."
