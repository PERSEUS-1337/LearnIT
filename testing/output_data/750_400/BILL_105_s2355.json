    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant indicator of a young person's struggles, leading to school dropouts and increased likelihood of welfare dependence, unemployment, and criminal behavior. Truancy is a key factor in criminal behavior, with high rates linked to daytime burglary and vandalism. Violent juvenile crime often occurs during school hours, and a significant percentage of arrested children are truants. Truancy is associated with high burglary rates and vandalism. Up to 44 percent of violent juvenile crime happens during school hours, and 75 percent of children aged 13-16 arrested for crimes are truants. Some cities have unexcused absences as high as 70 percent, with up to 4,000 absences per day. The social and economic costs of truancy are significant, with only 34 percent of inmates completing high school and 17 percent of youth in adult prisons not finishing grade school. Truancy in a city can lead to 4,000 absences per day, with significant social and economic costs. Only 34% of inmates complete high school, and truants cost the nation $240 billion in lost earnings. Parents are often unaware of their child's truancy. Effective truancy prevention programs can reduce daytime crime rates and improve school attendance. Lack of targeted funding hinders these programs in current law. SEC. 3. GRANTS. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"eligible partnership,\" \"local educational agency,\" and \"qualified unit of local government.\" The term \"qualified unit of local government\" refers to a local government unit that has a statute or regulation meeting specific requirements under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. The eligible partnership can apply for a grant under this section if they meet specific requirements outlined in the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. The term \"unit of local government\" refers to various political subdivisions of a State or Indian tribe. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, has the authority to make grants according to these guidelines. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, will provide grants to eligible partnerships on a competitive basis to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. The maximum grant amount awarded in any fiscal year is $100,000. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, will provide grants to eligible partnerships on a competitive basis to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. The total grant amount in any fiscal year shall not exceed $100,000, with at least 25 percent allocated for use by the local educational agency participating in the partnership. Grants may be renewed for an additional period. Not less than 25 percent of each grant awarded to an eligible partnership must be allocated for use by the local educational agency participating in the partnership. Grants awarded under this section may be renewed for up to 2 fiscal years. Grant amounts can be used to address truancy through parental involvement in prevention activities. Grant amounts under this section can be used by eligible partnerships to address truancy through parental involvement, sanctions, and parental accountability. Grants may be renewed for up to 2 fiscal years. The grant funds can be used to address truancy by implementing measures such as parental responsibility incentives, sanctions for habitually truant students, parental accountability through fines and community service, in-school prevention programs, and collaboration with various community entities. In-school truancy prevention programs, involvement of local community entities, technology use, and elimination of incentives for truancy are key strategies to address truancy. In addressing truancy, key strategies include in-school prevention programs, community involvement, technology use such as automated systems, and eliminating incentives for truancy. Model programs like the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, may receive priority funding. The Attorney General may prioritize funding programs that replicate model truancy intervention programs such as those in Fulton County, Georgia, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roswell, New Mexico, Rohnert Park, California, and New Haven. Several truancy intervention programs across different states have been identified for potential funding, including the TABS program in Milwaukee, the Roswell Daytime Curfew Program, the Stop, Cite and Return Program in Rohnert Park, the Stay in School Program in New Haven, the Atlantic County Project Helping Hand, and the THRIVE initiative in Oklahoma City. The truancy intervention programs identified for potential funding include the Stay in School Program in New Haven, Connecticut; the Atlantic County Project Helping Hand in Atlantic County, New Jersey; the THRIVE initiative in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; a project in Norfolk, Virginia using computer software and data collection; the Community Service Early Intervention Program in Marion, Ohio; and the Truancy Reduction Program in Bakersfield, California. Authorization of Appropriations: $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 1999, 2000, and 2001 to fund various truancy intervention programs, including those in Norfolk, Virginia; Marion, Ohio; Bakersfield, California; Farmington, New Mexico; and any other model program deemed appropriate by the Attorney General."
