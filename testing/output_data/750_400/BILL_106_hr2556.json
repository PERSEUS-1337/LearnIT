    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit private entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The National Environmental Policy Institute may receive the grant if they apply. The Secretary of Transportation will grant the National Environmental Policy Institute to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. The Secretary will collaborate with the EPA and the Department of Energy to implement a proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program for telecommuting. Employers participating in telecommuting will be defined as those who use telecommunications for work functions. Definitions for this section include participating employers who engage in telecommuting, which involves using telecommunications to work remotely and reduce commuting. Regulated entities are those subject to Clean Air Act regulations on ozone precursor emissions. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"regulated entities\" under the Clean Air Act and the term \"ozone precursors\" as air pollutants that contribute to ground-level ozone. It also defines \"VMTs\" as vehicle-miles-traveled in the context of a proposed pilot program. The curr_chunk describes a pilot program to evaluate emissions reductions of ozone precursors through reduced VMTs by telecommuting employees. The pilot program evaluates emissions reductions of ozone precursors through reduced VMTs by telecommuting employees, with employers able to transfer emission reductions to other parties using certificates. The pilot program allows employers to transfer emission reductions achieved by telecommuting employees to other parties through certificates called \"emission credits.\" These credits can be traded and exchanged in a commercial forum open to the public. The pilot program allows employers to transfer emission reductions achieved by telecommuting employees to other parties through certificates called \"emission credits.\" A commercial trading and exchange forum is available for public trading and exchanging of these credits, which regulated entities can obtain through direct trades. Regulated entities can then present these emission credits to the Federal Government or State. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through commercial trading or direct exchanges with credit holders. These credits can be presented to the Federal Government or State to assist in achieving compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Federal Government or State can receive emission credits to help comply with the Clean Air Act. The government will explore ways to transfer credits between employers and entities. The Secretary will designate sites for the pilot program. The Federal Government will explore means to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between employers and entities to achieve compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Secretary will ensure that the pilot program is carried out in specific geographic areas. The pilot program under subsection (a) will be implemented in specific geographic areas, including the greater metropolitan regions of the District of Columbia, Los Angeles, and three additional areas chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the grantee. The Secretary will select three additional areas, in consultation with the grantee, for the pilot program implementation. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the chosen geographic areas. The Secretary will also require a study and report from the grantee in developing the program design. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the geographic area for paragraph (1) implementation. The Secretary will require a study and report on the potential significance of the proposed pilot program for expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs in the designated areas. The proposed pilot program aims to incentivize telecommuting and reduce vehicle miles traveled in specific geographic areas. It is expected to have positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the grant under the program. The pilot program aims to incentivize telecommuting and reduce vehicle miles traveled in specific areas. It will impact transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. $250,000 is authorized for appropriations for the grant in fiscal year 2000."
