The Administrator will utilize the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) to coordinate requirements throughout the Administration, ensuring representation from specific offices actively engaged with unmanned maritime systems. Coordination with the Navy is also mandated in carrying out the Act. The Administrator will coordinate with specific offices and the Navy to leverage expertise in developing unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator shall coordinate with the Secretary of the Navy to leverage expertise in unmanned maritime systems development and align with strategic priorities. They should also utilize Naval unmanned systems test ranges for testing and training purposes. The Navy's strategic priorities include utilizing Naval unmanned systems test ranges for testing and training, maximizing interagency cooperation, and formalizing coordination with the Secretary of the Navy. The Navy aims to formalize coordination with the Secretary of the Navy to incorporate Administration priorities into research and development activities, partner on unmanned maritime systems procurement, and establish test or training ranges. The Secretary of the Navy conducts development activities, consults with the Administration on unmanned maritime systems procurement, establishes test or training ranges, and allows access to Naval facilities for specified purposes. The Administrator will utilize Navy facilities for activities authorized by the Act, including mapping, bathymetry, observations, and ocean exploration. The activities will be carried out at a co-located facility for efficiency. The Administrator will utilize Navy facilities for activities authorized by the Act, focusing on advancing unmanned maritime systems through collaboration and accelerating transition from concept to manufacturing. Advancing development of unmanned maritime systems includes research, testing, modifications, and integration. Accelerating transition from concept to manufacturing and acquisition. Coordination with other federal agencies may be done through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy may utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination in advancing unmanned maritime systems. Coordination with academic research institutions is also allowed for maximizing research and development opportunities. In carrying out the Act, the Administrator may coordinate with academic research institutions for research and development, training in unmanned maritime systems, and facilitating commercialization through partnerships. Facilitating the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems through public-private partnerships that includes academic research institutions, private industry, and public safety agencies, and arranging access to facilities for testing and training under various environmental conditions. Arranging access to additional facilities for testing and training unmanned maritime systems under various environmental conditions, certifying operational capacity, and promoting information sharing between academic, environmental, and military institutions. The curr_chunk discusses facilitating engagement with academic institutions and promoting information sharing in unmanned maritime systems. It also mentions coordination with the private sector. The curr_chunk focuses on coordinating with the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assess commercially available options for Navy missions and goals. The curr_chunk discusses coordinating with the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assess commercially available options for Navy missions and goals. This includes regular assessments to support National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. The Administrator will regularly assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. This will be done through science-based assessments conducted by the Assistant Administrator. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting its missions. This assessment will be conducted through science-based evaluations to determine the suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of these systems. The operational utility of unmanned maritime systems will also be assessed to ensure they meet data specifications required by the Administration. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will assess unmanned maritime systems for their suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications. The assessment will also evaluate the operational reliability and cost-effectiveness of these systems for making observations required by the Administration.
