Previous attacks aimed to degrade performance or manipulate specific outputs, but new attacks can reprogram the model to perform tasks chosen by the attacker without specifying the desired output for each input. This attack finds a single perturbation that can be added to all inputs to make the model perform a task. Adversarial reprogramming attacks can reprogram a machine learning model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without specifying the desired output for each input. This attack finds a single perturbation that can be added to all inputs to make the model perform the task. The perturbations act as a program for the new task, demonstrated on ImageNet classification models for tasks like counting and classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10. Adversarial reprogramming attacks can repurpose machine learning models to perform tasks chosen by the attacker, even if the model was not trained for those tasks. This can be achieved by finding a single perturbation that acts as a program for the new task. The study of adversarial examples focuses on the danger of attackers causing model prediction errors with minimal changes to the input, such as making a self-driving car react to a fake stop sign with a small sticker. The study of adversarial examples focuses on attackers causing model prediction errors with minimal changes to input, like making a self-driving car react to a fake stop sign with a small sticker. Various methods have been proposed to construct and defend against these attacks. Adversarial attacks involve perturbing inputs to deceive models, such as using stickers to fool a self-driving car or doctoring photos to inflate insurance claims. Methods have been developed to construct and defend against these attacks, which can be untargeted or targeted in nature. Adversarial attacks can be untargeted or targeted, aiming to degrade model performance or produce specific outputs. Attacks do not always adhere to this framework, so it is important to anticipate other types of attacks. In this work, a novel adversarial goal is considered: reprogramming the model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without needing to compute the specific desired output. In this work, the focus is on anticipating unexplored adversarial goals to enhance machine learning system security. The novel adversarial goal discussed involves reprogramming the model to execute a task chosen by the attacker without the need to compute the specific desired output. This is achieved through learning adversarial reprogramming functions that map between different tasks. An adversary can reprogram a model to perform a different task by learning adversarial reprogramming functions that map between the original task and the adversarial task. This is done by adjusting parameters to achieve the desired mapping between the two tasks. In adversarial reprogramming, functions h f and h g are used to map between tasks by adjusting parameters to achieve the desired mapping. The functions convert inputs and outputs between domains, with h f processing small images and h g mapping output class labels. Adversarial reprogramming involves using functions h f and h g to repurpose a model for a new task by mapping between input and output formats. The functions convert inputs and outputs between domains, with h f processing small images and h g mapping output class labels. The adversarial program \u03b8 is used in the transformation process. Adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model for a new task using consistent transformations h f and h g. The attack does not need to be imperceptible to humans to be successful, and potential consequences include theft of computational resources. Adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model for a new task using consistent transformations. The attack does not require imperceptibility to humans for success. Potential consequences include theft of computational resources and abuse of machine learning services for unethical tasks. The risks of adversarial reprogramming include theft of computational resources, repurposing AI-driven assistants into spies or spam bots, and abusing machine learning services for unethical tasks. This flexibility is consistent with the expressive power of deep neural networks. The flexibility of neural networks allows for repurposing through changes in input, demonstrating their expressive power. Studies show that even with limited parameter updates, networks can achieve high accuracy, highlighting the potential for modification through input offsets. The paper discusses the exponential increase in unique output patterns achievable by moving along a one-dimensional trajectory in input space with network depth. It also highlights that networks can be trained to high accuracy even with restricted parameter updates in a low-dimensional subspace. Additionally, it explains how an additive offset to a neural network's input is equivalent to modifying its first layer biases, leading to adversarial programs corresponding to updates in a low-dimensional parameter subspace.

They discuss concealing adversarial programs and end with a summary of their results. Adversarial examples are inputs intentionally designed to cause machine learning models to make mistakes. These attacks can be untargeted or targeted, and have been proposed in various domains such as malware detection, generative models, and reinforcement learning tasks. Adversarial attacks can be untargeted or targeted, proposed in domains like malware detection, generative models, and reinforcement learning tasks. Reprogramming is developed to extend this work. Reprogramming methods aim to produce specific functionality rather than a hardcoded output in adversarial attacks. Modifications can be applied to different inputs to create adversarial examples, such as an \"adversarial patch\" designed to switch predictions of multiple models. In reprogramming methods for adversarial attacks, the focus is on generating specific functionality rather than a fixed output. Authors have shown that a single modification can create adversarial examples for various inputs. For instance, an \"adversarial patch\" was created to manipulate predictions across multiple models. The goal is to develop a single adversarial program that can process different input images according to its design, akin to parasitic computing. Adversarial reprogramming involves creating a single program that can manipulate the predictions of various models when presented with different input images. This concept is similar to parasitic computing, where a target system is forced to perform complex tasks it wasn't originally designed for. Adversarial reprogramming involves manipulating models with different input images, similar to parasitic computing. It forces a system to solve complex tasks by exploiting network communication protocols. Weird machines allow running arbitrary code on a targeted computer through carefully crafted inputs. Adversarial reprogramming repurposes neural networks for new tasks, similar to transfer learning methods. Neural networks have versatile properties that make them useful for various tasks. Transfer learning and adversarial reprogramming repurpose neural networks for new tasks by using knowledge from one task as a base. Neural networks have versatile properties that make them useful for various tasks, such as developing features resembling Gabor filters in early layers when trained on images. Transfer learning allows neural networks to be repurposed for new tasks by changing model parameters, unlike adversarial reprogramming. Neural networks develop Gabor filter-like features when trained on images for various tasks. It is possible to use a convolutional neural network trained for one task and train a linear SVM classifier to adapt it for other tasks. In contrast to transfer learning, adversarial reprogramming involves altering model parameters for new tasks rather than just manipulating input data. Adversarial reprogramming across tasks with different datasets is more challenging than transfer learning. Adversarial reprogramming involves altering model parameters for new tasks through manipulation of the input. The adversary aims to reprogram the neural network to perform a different task by crafting an adversarial program to be included in the network input. This is more challenging than transfer learning, especially when dealing with tasks across different datasets. The work discusses an adversary reprogramming a neural network to perform a new task by adding an adversarial program to the network input. The adversarial program is not specific to a single image and is applied to all images. This method can be extended to various settings beyond ImageNet classification. The adversarial program discussed is an additive contribution to network input, not specific to a single image, and applicable to all images. It is defined by parameters W, image width n, and a masking matrix M. The mask M is optional and used to improve visualization. The adversarial program parameters W are learned for the program DISPLAYFORM0, with n as the ImageNet image width. A masking matrix M, optional for visualization, is used where 0 corresponds to adversarial data. The adversarial perturbation is bounded by tanh (\u00b7) to be within (-1, 1). The sample x from the dataset has dimensions k x k x 3, with X being the equivalent in dimensions n x n x 3. The adversarial program parameters W are learned for the program to improve visualization. The adversarial perturbation is bounded by tanh to be within (-1, 1). The sample x from the dataset has dimensions k x k x 3, with X being the equivalent in dimensions n x n x 3. The adversarial image is defined by a mapping function h g (y adv ) for ImageNet labels. The adversarial goal is to maximize the probability that an ImageNet classifier assigns the correct label to an adversarial task. This is achieved by mapping adversarial labels to a set of ImageNet labels using a predefined function. The adversarial goal is to maximize the probability that an ImageNet classifier assigns the correct label to an adversarial task by mapping adversarial labels to a set of ImageNet labels using a predefined function. The optimization problem includes a weight norm penalty to reduce overfitting, optimized with Adam and exponentially decaying learning rate. Hyperparameters are provided in Appendix A. After setting up the optimization problem with a weight norm penalty to reduce overfitting, the adversarial program minimizes computation cost by only requiring the computation of X adv and mapping the resulting ImageNet label to the correct class. This allows the majority of computation to be handled by the target network during inference. The adversarial reprogramming program has minimal computation cost for the adversary, as it only requires computing X adv and mapping the resulting ImageNet label to the correct class. It must exploit the nonlinear behavior of the target model, unlike traditional adversarial examples that rely on linear approximations of deep neural networks.

The study demonstrated the feasibility of adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet-trained architectures. It compared the resistance of trained networks to adversarial reprogramming and their susceptibility to random networks. The reprogrammed networks could perform tasks like counting squares, MNIST classification, and CIFAR-10 classification. The study showed the possibility of concealing adversarial programs and data. An example involved counting squares in images of various sizes and positions. The resulting adversarial images were larger and included the original images. The study involved creating adversarial images by embedding 36 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 3 images of white squares with black frames into larger images of size 299 \u00d7 299 \u00d7 3. The squares were placed randomly on gridpoints, and the adversarial program served as a frame around the counting task images. Each ImageNet model had a corresponding adversarial program with the first 10 ImageNet labels representing the number of squares in each image. The study involved training adversarial programs for ImageNet models using 36 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 3 images of squares placed randomly on gridpoints within larger images of size 299 \u00d7 299 \u00d7 3. The adversarial task was to count the number of squares in each image, unrelated to the ImageNet labels. The accuracy was evaluated by comparing network predictions to the actual number of squares in 100,000 sampled images. The adversarial program successfully mastered the task of counting squares in images, despite the dissimilarity between ImageNet labels and the task labels. Neural networks were vulnerable to reprogramming for this simple task using only additive contributions to the input. The adversarial program successfully reprogrammed neural networks to count squares in images, demonstrating vulnerability to input manipulation. Next, the program tackled the more complex task of classifying MNIST digits, ensuring it did not simply memorize training examples. In this section, adversarial reprogramming successfully transformed ImageNet networks into MNIST classifiers using additive adversarial programs. The program avoided memorization of training examples and demonstrated the ability to classify MNIST digits within a frame. In this study, ImageNet networks were reprogrammed to function as MNIST classifiers using adversarial programs. The reprogramming was successful and generalized well from training to test sets, showing robustness to small input changes.

Adversarial programs showed visual similarities despite differences in tasks, such as possessing low spatial frequency texture in ResNet architecture. The degree of susceptibility to adversarial reprogramming depends on the model being attacked, as shown in attack success on an Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data. The study examined attack success on an Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data using adversarial training. Results show that the model, despite being trained with adversarial examples, is still vulnerable to reprogramming with only a slight reduction in attack success. The study found that training with adversarial examples did not effectively guard against adversarial reprogramming, as the model remained vulnerable with only a slight reduction in attack success. This suggests that standard approaches to adversarial defense may not be effective against reprogramming attacks. The study revealed that standard adversarial defense methods are ineffective against adversarial reprogramming, which aims to repurpose the network rather than cause specific mistakes. Adversarial reprogramming involves large magnitude programs, unlike traditional attacks with small perturbations, and defense methods may not generalize to data from the adversarial task.

Adversarial reprogramming attacks were performed on models with random weights, showing that training on the MNIST classification task was challenging for networks with randomly initialized weights. In adversarial reprogramming attacks on models with random weights, training on the MNIST task was challenging and generally led to lower accuracy compared to models pretrained on ImageNet. Only ResNet V2 50 achieved similar accuracy to trained ImageNet models. The appearance of adversarial programs was qualitatively different from those obtained with pretrained networks. Training random networks on the MNIST task was challenging and led to lower accuracy compared to models pretrained on ImageNet. Only ResNet V2 50 achieved similar accuracy to trained ImageNet models. The appearance of adversarial programs was qualitatively different from those obtained with pretrained networks, showing the importance of the original task the neural networks perform for adversarial reprogramming. The original task neural networks perform is crucial for adversarial reprogramming, as shown by training random networks on ImageNet. Random networks may not perform well initially due to poor weight scaling, unlike trained networks. This insight is supported by the use of random networks as generative models for images. Randomly initialized networks may perform poorly initially due to poor weight scaling, unlike trained networks. Adversarial reprogramming may rely on similarities between original and adversarial data, which can be addressed by randomizing pixels on MNIST digits to remove any resemblance between the two datasets. The study investigated the impact of transfer learning on reprogramming ImageNet networks using randomized MNIST digits, showing that despite lacking spatial structure, the networks achieved comparable accuracy to standard MNIST. Reprogramming pretrained ImageNet networks to classify shuffled MNIST and CIFAR-10 images showed comparable accuracy to standard datasets, despite the lack of spatial structure in the shuffled images. Our results demonstrate the reprogramming of neural networks to classify shuffled CIFAR-10 images, with decreased accuracy due to the convolutional structure not being useful for this task. The possibility of reprogramming across tasks with unrelated datasets and domains is suggested, indicating a potential for knowledge transfer beyond original data. The results suggest the possibility of reprogramming neural networks across tasks and domains, even when limiting the visibility of adversarial perturbations. In a previous experiment, there were no constraints on the size or scale of adversarial programs. However, in new experiments, the visibility of adversarial perturbations was limited by reducing program size or scale. Using an Inception V3 model pretrained on ImageNet, the network was reprogrammed to classify MNIST digits with smaller adversarial programs, resulting in successful but less accurate reprogramming. In new experiments, the visibility of adversarial perturbations was limited by reducing program size or scale. Adversarial reprogramming was successful with smaller adversarial programs, even with nearly imperceptible programs. In experiments, adversarial reprogramming was successful with nearly imperceptible programs, even when hiding both data and program within a normal image. In experiments, adversarial reprogramming successfully concealed both the adversarial data and program within a normal ImageNet image by shuffling pixels and limiting the scale of the data and program. The study successfully concealed adversarial data and program within ImageNet images by shuffling pixels and limiting perturbation scale. The resulting adversarial images closely resemble normal ImageNet images, reprogramming the network to classify MNIST digits. The study demonstrated the ability to hide adversarial tasks within ImageNet images by shuffling pixels and limiting perturbation scale. This resulted in adversarial images that closely resemble normal ImageNet images, successfully reprogramming the network to classify MNIST digits with lower accuracy. Further complex schemes could be explored for hiding adversarial tasks. The study successfully reprogrammed the network to classify MNIST digits with lower accuracy by hiding the adversarial task within an ImageNet image using a simple shuffling technique. Trained neural networks were found to be more susceptible to adversarial reprogramming than random networks. Reprogramming was still successful even when the data structure was very different. Further exploration of complex schemes for hiding adversarial tasks is suggested. Our study reprogrammed neural networks to classify MNIST digits with lower accuracy by embedding the adversarial task in an ImageNet image. Trained networks were more vulnerable to reprogramming than random ones, showing flexibility in repurposing trained weights for new tasks. This suggests the potential for more adaptable and efficient machine learning systems. The study demonstrated the flexibility of repurposing trained weights for new tasks in neural networks. This suggests the potential for more adaptable and efficient machine learning systems. Recent work in machine learning has focused on building large dynamically connected networks with reusable components, making them more flexible and efficient due to shared compute. It is unclear whether reduced performance in targeting random networks or reprogramming for CIFAR-10 classification was due to limitations in expressivity of adversarial perturbation or difficulty in optimization task. Future research could explore limitations in expressivity and trainability. Adversarial reprogramming on classification tasks in the image domain shows potential for future research in other domains like audio, video, and text. Reprogramming trained networks to classify shuffled images suggests cross-domain reprogramming is feasible. Future research could explore the possibility of reprogramming trained networks in different domains like audio, video, and text. The finding that networks can classify shuffled images without original spatial structure implies potential for cross-domain reprogramming. Reprogramming recurrent neural networks, especially those with attention or memory, could be of particular interest. Reprogramming RNNs with attention or memory can lead to Turing completeness. Attackers can manipulate RNNs with simple operations like incrementing counters to achieve various malicious goals, including theft of computational resources. Reprogramming RNNs with simple operations like incrementing counters at location BID28 could lead to theft of computational resources through adversarial programs. This could enable attackers to manipulate RNNs to perform any computational task, such as solving image captchas for creating spam accounts. An attacker could reprogram RNNs to steal computational resources, potentially violating ethical guidelines of ML service providers. This poses a significant danger beyond just computational theft. In this work, a new class of adversarial attacks is proposed to reprogram neural networks for novel tasks, potentially violating ethical guidelines of ML service providers. These attacks demonstrate the surprising flexibility and vulnerability of deep neural networks. Future research should explore the properties and limitations of adversarial attacks.
