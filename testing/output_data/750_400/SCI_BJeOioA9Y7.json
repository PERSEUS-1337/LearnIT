The student can be trained independently of the teachers and shows superior performance on various supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. The knowledge flow approach transfers knowledge from multiple deep nets (teachers) to a new deep net model (student). The student can be trained independently and outperforms other methods on supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. Research communities have developed numerous deep net architectures for various tasks, with new ones constantly being introduced. Some architectures are trained from scratch, while others are fine-tuned using a similar deep net trained on different data. In reinforcement learning, teachers play a role in models like progressive neural net and PathNet, where they help extract useful features for new tasks. In reinforcement learning, teachers are utilized in various ways by different models such as progressive neural net, PathNet, 'Growing a Brain', and Actor-mimic for extracting useful features and fine-tuning neural networks. PathNet BID6, 'Growing a Brain' BID30, Actor-mimic BID20, and Knowledge distillation BID9 are techniques for learning new tasks by fine-tuning neural networks or distilling knowledge from large ensembles. However, progressive neural net models BID23 have limitations due to the large number of parameters. The limitations of existing techniques for training new models include the growth of progressive neural net models with the number of teachers, the computational intensity of searching for pathways in PathNet, and the restriction to using only one pretrained model at a time in fine-tuning based methods like 'Growing a Brain' and actor-mimic. The development of knowledge flow addresses the limitations of existing techniques by allowing multiple teachers to transfer knowledge to a student during training, ensuring independence of the student at the final stage, and maintaining a constant size for the resulting student network. Our approach, knowledge flow, allows multiple teachers to transfer knowledge to a student during training, ensuring independence of the student at the final stage, and maintaining a constant size for the resulting student network. This framework is flexible in choosing teacher models and applicable to various tasks from reinforcement learning to fully-supervised training. Our approach, knowledge flow, enables multiple teachers to transfer knowledge to a student during training, ensuring independence of the student at the final stage while maintaining a constant student network size. This framework is flexible in selecting teacher models and can be applied to tasks ranging from reinforcement learning to fully-supervised training. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy that maximizes the expected future reward from each state. The asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) formulation is followed in this paper to achieve this objective. The trajectory \u03c0 \u03b8\u03c0 (x) = arg max a\u2208A\u03c0\u03b8\u03c0 (a|x) is generated by following the A3C formulation. The policy is optimized using a loss function based on negative log-likelihood and negative entropy regularization. The policy parameters \u03b8\u03c0 are optimized using a loss function based on negative log-likelihood and negative entropy regularization, with the trajectory \u03c0\u03b8\u03c0(x) obtained from a probability distribution over states modeled by a deep net. The value function is approximated by a deep net V\u03b8v(x), and the optimization includes a scaled negative log-likelihood term and a negative entropy regularizer. The policy parameters \u03b8\u03c0 are optimized using negative log-likelihood and negative entropy regularization. The value function V\u03b8v is optimized using a squared loss function. The optimization process involves minimizing the empirical expectation of the policy and value functions alternately to learn both. The text discusses optimizing policy parameters \u03b8\u03c0 with negative log-likelihood and entropy regularization, and optimizing value function V\u03b8v using squared loss. The process involves minimizing empirical expectations alternately to maximize expected return. Warm-start techniques can be used instead of optimizing from scratch. The proposed knowledge flow framework transfers knowledge from multiple deep nets. The text introduces a framework called knowledge flow, which transfers knowledge from multiple deep nets (teachers) to a deep net under training (student) to improve learning efficiency. Initially, the student heavily relies on one teacher, but as training progresses, the student becomes more independent. The framework of knowledge flow transfers knowledge from multiple deep nets (teachers) to a deep net under training (student). Initially, the student heavily relies on one teacher, but as training progresses, the student becomes more independent. The student's parameters are randomly initialized, while the teachers' parameters are fixed and obtained from pre-trained models on different source tasks. The student becomes independent as knowledge is transferred from multiple teachers to the student net. Teachers have fixed parameters from pre-trained models on different tasks. The student net is modified by adding representations from teacher deep nets. The student net is modified by transferring knowledge from multiple teachers trained by different algorithms. Teacher representations are transformed and scaled before being added to the student net, with normalized weights determining which representations to trust at each layer. The student net is enhanced by incorporating knowledge from multiple teachers through transformed and scaled representations. Normalized weights dictate which teacher or student representation to trust at each layer, aiming for the student model to perform well on the target task independently of the teachers after training. After training, the student model should perform well on the target task without relying on teachers. Increasingly encouraging a high normalized weight on the student representation helps the student capture all knowledge, reducing reliance on teacher knowledge as training progresses. During training, the student model initially relies heavily on teacher knowledge to improve performance but becomes more independent as training progresses. Two additional loss functions are introduced to encourage this transfer of knowledge, ensuring the student can master the task on its own. During final stages of training, the student is encouraged to become independent and no longer rely on teachers. Two additional loss functions are introduced to capture the student's dependency on teachers and ensure stable behavior as teacher influence decreases. The dependency loss captures student reliance on teachers through weight vector w. Another loss function ensures stable behavior as teacher influence decreases. The transformed program for supervised and reinforcement learning includes additional loss terms and cross-connections. The transformed program for supervised and reinforcement learning includes additional loss terms and cross-connections, with parameters \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 controlling the strength to decrease the influence of the teacher. The tilde ('\u00b7') denotes dependence on w, Q, f, and \u03c0. Parameters \u03b8 and \u03b8 old are used in current and previous iterations. \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 control the teacher's influence strength in supervised and reinforcement learning. Gradually increasing \u03bb 1 value allows the student to become independent during training, preventing negative transfer if teacher and student objectives differ. The proposed method gradually increases the weight for teacher layers during training to allow the student to become independent. Despite differences in objectives, low level knowledge transfer from teachers can still benefit students. The proposed method gradually decreases the weight for teacher layers to reduce negative transfer effects. Students could benefit from low level representation of teachers, observed in experiments. Modifications to deep nets and loss functions dep and KL are detailed to successively decrease teacher influence. Candidate set L j is defined for each layer in the student model, containing relevant teacher layers. The method gradually reduces the influence of teacher layers on students by modifying deep nets and using specific loss functions. Candidate sets are defined for each layer in the student model to determine which teacher or student representation to trust. Normalized weights are introduced to decide the trust level at each layer. The student model combines layers from different teachers to determine trust levels at each layer using normalized weights. The method limits the influence of teacher layers on students by defining candidate sets for each layer in the student model. The student deep net combines layers from different teachers using normalized weights. The method limits the influence of teacher layers on students by defining candidate sets for each layer. The maximal number of introduced matrices in the framework is constrained. Results from PathNet and PNN are approximated from plots. State-of-the-art methods like A3C, PPO, and ACKTR may have irrelevant features for a student's top layer. In practice, it is recommended to link one teacher layer to one or two student layers, introducing matrices Q. Additional trainable parameters Q and w are also introduced. In practice, it is recommended to link one teacher layer to one or two student layers, introducing matrices Q. Additional trainable parameters Q and w are also introduced in the framework, functioning as auxiliary knobs to help the student learn faster. The student becomes independent in the final stage of training and no longer relies on Q. In the framework, trainable parameters Q and w act as auxiliary knobs to help the student learn faster. During training, the influence of teachers is gradually decreased to encourage the student's independence. During training, the influence of teachers is gradually decreased to encourage the student's independence by increasing the weights for the student's layers. This is achieved by minimizing the dependence cost, leading to the student becoming more independent. During training, the student's independence is encouraged by minimizing the dependence cost, leading to an increase in weights for the student's layers. This results in the student becoming more independent from the influence of teachers. However, a fast decrease in the teacher's influence can degrade performance as it takes time to find good transformations. During training, minimizing the dependence cost increases the student's independence from teachers. However, a rapid decrease in the teacher's influence can harm performance as it takes time to find optimal transformations. To prevent rapid changes in the student's output distribution, a Kullback-Leibler regularizer is used. To prevent rapid changes in the student's output distribution, a Kullback-Leibler regularizer is used in supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. Results are evaluated using only the student model to avoid any influence from teacher nets. Knowledge flow is assessed in reinforcement learning using Atari games. In reinforcement learning, knowledge flow is evaluated using Atari games with raw images as input. The agent predicts actions based on rewards and input images, choosing an action every four frames. The last action is repeated on skipped frames to avoid influence from teacher models. The agent in reinforcement learning predicts actions in Atari games using raw images as input. It chooses an action every four frames, with the last action repeated on skipped frames. The model architecture includes three hidden layers with convolutional and fully connected layers. The model used in reinforcement learning for predicting actions in Atari games is based on the A3C BID17 architecture with three hidden layers, including convolutional and fully connected layers.

Additionally, knowledge flow with non-expert teachers also outperforms fine-tuning on a non-expert teacher.

In knowledge flow, students can benefit from multiple teachers and avoid negative impacts from insufficiently pretrained teachers. Training curves for experiments are shown in FIG5, with more in the Appendix. The student can benefit from the intermediate representations of the teacher, even if input space, output space, and objectives differ.

PathNet BID6 enables multiple agents to train the same deep net while Progressive Net BID23 leverages transfer and avoids catastrophic forgetting. Our method introduces lateral connections to previously learned features, ensuring independence of the student during training. This addresses a limitation in Progressive Net BID23 where only a fraction of the student's capacity is utilized. Distral BID26 combines distillation and transfer learning for joint training of multiple models. Our method introduces lateral connections to previously learned features, ensuring independence of the student during training. In contrast to BID23, our method maximizes the student's capacity utilization. Distral, a combination of distillation and transfer learning, involves joint training of multiple tasks with a shared policy for consistency. Knowledge flow focuses on a single task, while multi-task learning addresses multiple tasks. BID26 explores joint training of multiple tasks with a shared 'distilled' policy to promote consistency. Unlike Distral, which is a multi-task learning framework, knowledge flow emphasizes a single task. Both multi-task learning and knowledge flow involve transferring information, but in multi-task learning, information from different tasks is shared to enhance performance, while in knowledge flow, information from multiple teachers helps a student learn a single task better. In multi-task learning, information from different tasks is shared to boost performance, while in knowledge flow, information from multiple teachers helps a student learn a single task better.

Future work includes determining when to use specific teachers and actively swapping them during training. The authors developed a knowledge distillation approach to train a deep net from multiple teachers, showing improvements in reinforcement and supervised learning. They plan to determine when to use specific teachers and actively swap them during training. Experiments were conducted on MNIST, MNIST with digit '3' missing, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. The study focuses on knowledge distillation, where smaller student models learn from larger teacher models. Experiments were conducted on various datasets using different model structures. The study explores knowledge distillation, where smaller student models learn from larger teacher models on various datasets. The teacher models include an MLP for MNIST, a model from Chen for CIFAR-100, and a 50-layer ResNet for ImageNet. The student models mimic the teacher structures but with adjustments. The framework consistently outperforms traditional knowledge distillation due to the student model benefiting from both the teacher's output layer behavior and other factors. The study compares the performance of teacher and student models in knowledge distillation on various datasets. The student model benefits from the teacher's output layer behavior and intermediate layer representations. The 'EMNIST Letters' dataset consists of 26 balanced classes of handwritten letters, while the 'EMNIST Digits' dataset contains images of digits. The 'EMNIST Letters' dataset has 26 balanced classes of handwritten letters in 28 \u00d7 28 pixel images, while the 'EMNIST Digits' dataset has 10 balanced classes of handwritten digits in the same size images. Training and test sets for each dataset vary in image quantities. The study uses the MNIST model as a baseline for teacher and student models, trained on different variations of the EMNIST datasets.

The STL-10 dataset consists of colored images with 10 balanced classes. Training set has 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled. In the experiment, student learning with expert, semi-expert, and non-expert teachers showed better performance compared to baseline and fine-tuning methods. The STL-10 dataset contains colored images with 10 balanced classes, and the training set includes 5,000 labeled images.

Teachers were trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and results were compared to fine-tuning methods in Table 6. In the experiment, teachers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 were compared to fine-tuning methods on the STL-10 dataset. Fine-tuning with pretrained weights reduced test errors by more than 10%, while student model training in their framework further decreased errors by 3%. Their approach only used labeled data for training, unlike other semi-supervised methods. In their experiment, the model pretrained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 reduced test errors by over 10%. Student model training in their framework further decreased errors by 3%. Their approach only used labeled data for training, unlike other semi-supervised methods. They also compared their results to the state-of-the-art multi-task reinforcement learning framework Distral BID26. In Fig. 5, accuracy over training epochs is shown for our model compared to Distral BID26. Our model uses a central model and task models for each task in Atari games. We have three tasks, with teachers provided for task 2 and task 3. Distral is trained for 120M steps, while our model is trained for 40M steps. The experiments involve a central model (m 0 ) and task models (m i ) for each task in Atari games. Three tasks (task 1, task 2, task 3) are used, with teachers provided for task 2 (m 2 ) and task 3 (m 3 ). Distral is trained for 120M steps, while the model is trained for 40M steps. Results show that Distral is suboptimal for learning a multi-task agent, especially when the target task differs significantly from the source tasks. Distral's task 1 model (m 1 ) outperforms its center model (m 0 ) according to results in TAB5. Distral's suboptimal performance is attributed to its focus on learning a multi-task agent with assumed identical action and state space. Our framework, on the other hand, can reduce a teacher's influence and negative transfer. In the C10 experiment, the averaged normalized weight (p w ) for teachers and the student is plotted, showing that the C100 teacher should have a higher p w value than the SVHN teacher. Our framework can decrease a teacher's influence and reduce negative transfer. In the C10 experiment, the normalized weight (p w ) for teachers and the student is plotted, showing that the C100 teacher has a higher p w value than the SVHN teacher. The C100 teacher has a higher p w value than the SVHN teacher, indicating its relevance to the C10 experiment. Ablation study using untrained teachers shows worse performance compared to knowledgeable teachers, confirming the benefit of student learning from experienced teachers. In an ablation study, untrained teachers show worse performance compared to knowledgeable teachers, confirming the benefit of learning from experienced teachers. Learning with untrained teachers achieves an average reward of 15934, while learning with knowledgeable teachers achieves an average reward of 30928 in the hero task. Knowledge flow results in higher rewards than training with untrained teachers in different environments. The results show that learning from knowledgeable teachers leads to higher rewards compared to untrained teachers in various environments. The KL term helps maintain the student's output distribution when teachers' influence decreases. An ablation study with the KL coefficient set to zero is conducted to investigate its importance. The KL term prevents drastic changes in the student's output distribution when teachers' influence decreases. An ablation study with the KL coefficient set to zero shows that without the KL term, rewards drop significantly as teacher influence decreases. However, with the KL term, performance remains stable, achieving an average reward of 2907 at the end of training. Training with the KL term in the context of MsPacman and teachers Riverraid and Seaquest experts shows that performance remains stable even as teacher influence decreases. Learning with the KL term achieves an average reward of 2907, while learning without it achieves 1215. Additional experiments using different architectures for the teacher and student models were also conducted. Training with the KL term in MsPacman shows stable performance even as teacher influence decreases. Results in Fig. 9 (b, c) demonstrate higher rewards with the KL term.

Learning with teachers of different architectures achieves similar performance as learning with teachers of the same architecture in the experiment. The average reward at the end of training is 37520 for different architectures and 35012 for the same architecture. Knowledge flow enables higher rewards despite architectural differences. Using an average network for the parameters \u03b8 old, computed through exponential running average of model weights with \u03b1 = 0.9, results in improved performance, as shown in FIG0. Knowledge flow enables higher rewards even with different teacher and student architectures.

In a specific experiment with Boxing as the target task and a Riverraid expert as the teacher, the average reward achieved using an average network for \u03b8 old was 96.2, compared to 96.0 with a single network for \u03b8 old. Using an exponential average to compute \u03b8 old results in similar performance as using a single model. Results on using an average network are shown in FIG0 (b, c). Various techniques for knowledge transfer have been considered, such as fine-tuning, progressive neural nets, PathNet, 'Growing a Brain', actor-mimic, and learning without forgetting. PathNet BID6 allows multiple agents to train the same deep net by reusing parameters and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. This technique enables agents embedded in the neural net to discover which weights can be reused for new tasks. In contrast to PathNet BID6, our method involves multiple teacher nets trained with lateral connections to previously learned features, similar to Progressive Net BID23. Our method introduces scaling with normalized weights to ensure independence of the student during training, addressing a limitation in Progressive Net BID23. Distral, a combination of 'distill & transfer learning', involves joint training of multiple teacher nets. The discussed method introduces scaling with normalized weights to ensure student independence during training, addressing a limitation in BID23.

Knowledge flow focuses on a single task, unlike multi-task learning frameworks like Distral. BID26 explores joint training of multiple tasks with a shared policy to promote consistency. Unlike multi-task learning frameworks like Distral, knowledge flow concentrates on a single task. Both approaches involve transferring information, but in multi-task learning, information from different tasks is shared to enhance performance, while in knowledge flow, information from multiple teachers helps a student learn a single task better. In multi-task learning, information from different tasks is shared to boost performance, while in knowledge flow, information from multiple teachers helps a student learn a new task better.
