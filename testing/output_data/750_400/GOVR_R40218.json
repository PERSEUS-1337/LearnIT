    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP and other sources to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Federal law also directs child welfare agencies to develop policies for older youth transitioning from care. Research has shown that foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood despite the services and supports provided by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) and other sources. Research has shown that despite services and supports provided to foster youth, they still struggle with transitioning to adulthood. Compared to their peers, former foster youth are more likely to forego higher education, have fair or poor general health, become homeless, and rely on public supports. Research has shown that former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including higher likelihood of forgoing higher education, poor general health, homelessness, and reliance on public supports. Efforts by policy makers and advocates aim to provide support and connections to caring adults for youth transitioning from care. The 110th Congress focused on child welfare reforms, particularly for older youth in care, to ensure support and connections to caring adults for youth transitioning from care. The 110th Congress passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, a significant law for older youth in foster care. The 113th Congress also held hearings on child welfare reforms. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) are significant laws that address child welfare, specifically focusing on older youth in foster care. These laws aim to provide protections and promote normalcy among children in care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) passed by the 113th Congress focuses on older youth in foster care, promoting normalcy and providing protections for children at risk of sex trafficking. The report discusses issues affecting older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood, focusing on the implementation challenges of P.L. 110-351 and P.L. 113-183. One key issue is the difficulty states may face in extending foster care to older youth after age 18. The implementation challenges of extending foster care to older youth after age 18 under P.L. 110-351 include states hesitating due to cost concerns, despite federal assistance. States must also assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care. One challenge in extending foster care to older youth after age 18 is the cost concern for states, despite federal assistance. States are required to help youth develop a transition plan within 90 days of leaving care, which can involve starting the planning process early and involving supportive adults. Emancipated youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including difficulties in forming permanent connections with adults, obtaining health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Policy makers and advocates are concerned about older foster youth and those who have aged out facing challenges during the transition to adulthood. Emancipated youth struggle with forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database may shed light on their outcomes in education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. Additionally, there is a concern about foster youth being vulnerable to child sex trafficking. Transitioning from foster care to adulthood is a concern for older youth, especially those who have aged out. A national database may provide insights into their outcomes in education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. There is also a worry about foster youth being at risk of child sex trafficking. Legislation requires child welfare agencies to have policies in place to support these vulnerable youth. Congress should monitor state implementation of these requirements. Child sex trafficking involves adults exploiting children under 18 for commercial purposes. P.L. 113-183 mandates child welfare agencies to have policies for these vulnerable youth. Congress should oversee state compliance and identify best practices for victim support. The report will discuss implementation of P.L. 110-351 and ongoing issues related to transitioning youth from foster care. The report will discuss the number of victims reported by state child welfare agencies to the federal government and best practices for serving these victims, along with implementation of select aspects of P.L. 110-351 and other ongoing issues related to transitioning youth from foster care. The overall number of children in foster care has been declining in the past decade. The overall number of children in foster care has been declining in the past decade. On any given day in FY2002, approximately 523,000 children were in foster care, while the corresponding figure for FY2012 was 397,122. The share of older children in care also increased but then declined slightly over this period, with children ages 13 through 17 comprising about 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. In FY2002, approximately 523,000 children were in foster care, decreasing to 397,122 in FY2012. The share of older children in care increased but then declined slightly. Children ages 13-17 comprised 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. The number of youth aging out of foster care increased from over 20,000 in FY2002 to slightly more than 26,000 in FY2010. In FY2002, over 20,000 children aged out of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. By FY2010, the number increased to slightly more than 26,000 youth aged out, accounting for 11% of all children who exited. However, in FY2012, the number of youth emancipating reached a recent all-time low of 23,396 (10%). Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. Research on youth who age out of foster care shows negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin who entered care before age 16. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin who entered care before age 16. Surveyed youth responded to researcher questions in four data collection waves, starting at ages 17 and 18 while in foster care, up to age 26. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin who entered care before age 16 through four data collection waves. The most recent results at age 26 showed that former foster youth experienced more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. The Midwest Evaluation study compared outcomes of former foster youth to their peers in the general population. Results at age 26 showed that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes, such as lower college degree attainment. Barriers to education included financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Former foster youth had lower college degree attainment compared to their peers. Barriers to education included financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Despite almost equal job experience, fewer former foster youth were currently employed with a lower annual income. Former foster youth face challenges in education and employment, with lower college degree attainment and lower annual income compared to their peers. The state child welfare agency is responsible for children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect, using federal and state funds to facilitate successful reunification with parents. The child welfare agency, overseen by the court, cares for children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect. They use federal and state funds to reunite children with parents or find them a safe permanent home, primarily through Title IV-E foster care funding. States must agree to specific activities to receive federal funds for child welfare services. The primary federal source of funding for child welfare services is Title IV-E foster care, authorized under the Social Security Act. States must agree to specific activities to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care to receive federal funds. This includes having a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services to establish a permanent home. States receiving Title IV-E foster care funding must agree to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care by having a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services for a permanent home. The plan must be reviewed regularly, at least every 6 months by a judge or panel and every 12 months by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. The court must consult with the child in an age-appropriate manner during any permanency hearing. The case plan for children in foster care must be reviewed regularly, at least every 6 months by a judge or panel and every 12 months by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. For youth age 14 and older, the plan must include programs and services to help them transition to adulthood successfully. For youth age 14 and older in foster care, the written case plan must include programs and services to aid in their successful transition to adulthood. Additionally, the state child welfare agency must include a document listing the child's rights regarding education, health, visitation, court participation, and provision of identification documents if leaving foster care at age 18 or older. The state child welfare agency is required to include a document listing the rights of children in foster care aged 14 or older in their case plan. This includes rights related to education, health, visitation, court participation, provision of identification documents, safety, and avoiding exploitation. The child must acknowledge receipt of this list, and children aged 14 or older must be consulted in the development and revisions of their case plan. The case plan for children in foster care aged 14 or older must include a document listing their rights, such as education, health, visitation, and safety. Children must acknowledge receipt of this list, and they have the right to be consulted in the development and revisions of their case plan. They can choose up to two members for the planning teams, with one serving as their advisor and advocate. The child in foster care aged 14 or older can choose members for the case planning and permanency planning teams, with one serving as their advisor and advocate. This individual can help apply the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard\" for participation in extracurricular activities. States must also assist youth in developing a transition plan for housing and other needs upon emancipation. The reasonable and prudent parenting standard is applied for foster children's participation in extracurricular activities. States must also help youth develop a transition plan for housing and other needs post-emancipation. Efforts are made to reunite children with their parents for permanence, but in cases where it's not safe or possible, adoptive parents or legal guardians are sought for a permanent home and family. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares youth aging out of foster care for independence. The program aims to provide services to help these youth transition successfully when they are no longer under state custody. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program aims to prepare older youth aging out of foster care for independence. The program was established by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act in 2008, which made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, including provisions for older youth in foster care. States can now extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 19, 20, or 21. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act made changes to child welfare statutes, allowing states to extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act focused on the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking, providing protections for them. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addresses the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking by providing protections and promoting normalcy for children in care. It requires child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children. The law provides protections for older youth in care, promotes \"normalcy\" for children in foster care, and requires child welfare agencies to address sex trafficking of children. Federal child welfare law under Title IV-E allows states and tribes to seek funds for room and board costs for eligible children in out-of-home foster care. Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states and Indian tribes can receive federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in out-of-home foster care. Funding for this program is provided from the general treasury on an open-ended basis, obligating the federal government to reimburse states for eligible expenditures on behalf of children in care. The Title IV-E foster care program provides federal funding for eligible children in out-of-home foster care, reimbursing states for eligible expenditures. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, citizenship status, income/assets tests, age, and family structure. A judge must determine that the child's previous living situation was detrimental to their welfare. Title IV-E foster care provides federal funding for eligible children in out-of-home foster care, requiring the child to be in state care, a citizen or qualified alien, meet income/assets tests, age, and family structure rules. A judge must determine the previous living situation was harmful, and the state must make efforts to prevent placement and secure a permanent home for the child. Title IV-E foster care provides federal funding for eligible children in out-of-home foster care. The state must ensure the child's placement is in a licensed setting with a provider, and provide foster care maintenance payments for the child's care and safety. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" for every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school travel. Federal reimbursement for costs related to children in foster care can only be sought for those placed in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must also conduct specific activities. Federal reimbursement for costs related to children in foster care can only be sought for those placed in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes. Eligible young people in extended care may be placed in independent living settings. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of all youth in care. Children remain eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments until their 18th or 19th birthday if still in school. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of all youth in care. Children remain eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments until their 18th or 19th birthday if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting from FY2011. States may seek reimbursement for eligible youth aged 18 or older completing high school or equivalent training. States and tribes can provide Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments to youth until age 21 if they are completing high school or equivalent training, enrolled in post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or working at least 80 hours per month. Reimbursement can also be sought for older youth with medical conditions that prevent them from working. States and tribes can provide Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments to youth until age 21 if they are completing high school or equivalent training, enrolled in post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or working at least 80 hours per month.

States are permitted to seek federal foster care reimbursement for youth with medical conditions supported by regularly updated information in their case plan. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth with medical conditions that hinder their ability to work or attend school, supported by regularly updated information in their case plan. The law does not specify programs to remove barriers to employment or define medical conditions that could prevent youth from working or attending school. Foster care can be provided in licensed homes or child care institutions for up to 25 children. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. A child care institution must be licensed and can have up to 25 children. The definition excludes detention facilities or facilities primarily for delinquent children. Starting in FY2011, states can also seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older in foster care at state discretion. The definition of licensed foster care excludes facilities for delinquent children. States can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older in foster care at state discretion, as authorized by P.L. 110-351. HHS encourages extending federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21. The act directs HHS to establish regulations for a \"supervised setting\" where individuals live independently. HHS encourages states and tribes to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with the option to extend to a lower age with a rationale provided in their Title IV-E plan. Funding under Title IV-E is contingent upon compliance with these regulations. The state or tribe must submit a description of the rationale for extending federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21 in their Title IV-E plan. This plan outlines how they administer programs under Title IV-E, with funding contingent upon approval. States and tribes must establish criteria for determining eligibility based on employment, education, or medical conditions. Verification procedures must also be defined. The HHS guidance states that states and tribes must establish criteria to determine if young people meet employment or education conditions and verify their eligibility for federal foster care assistance under Title IV-E. The program instructions provide examples of education or employment activities youth in extended care can pursue. The program instructions provide examples of education or employment activities that youth in extended care can pursue, such as finishing high school, preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. States and tribes may establish specific requirements for extended foster care. HHS advises that states and tribes may establish requirements for extended foster care, such as providing assistance to youth enrolled in post-secondary education. States and tribes should consider offering support to youth aged 18 and older to ensure ample assistance for this population. The guidance advises states and tribes to consider providing extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older in foster care, with a focus on those enrolled in post-secondary education. Program instructions address eligibility criteria for Title IV-E foster care for young people reaching the state age of majority. The program instructions provide criteria for Title IV-E foster care eligibility for older youth who reach the state age of majority. This includes youth who continue in care, reenter care before age 21, or enter foster care for the first time at age 18 or older. States are not required to redetermine eligibility for federal foster care if the youth met the Title IV-E requirements at the time of removal from their home. For youth entering foster care at age 18 or older, eligibility is based on the youth's circumstances without considering their parents or legal guardians. Youth in extended care must have entered via a court order or voluntarily. States are not obligated to reassess eligibility for federal foster care if the youth met Title IV-E requirements at the time of removal from their home. For youth age 18 or older entering or reentering care, eligibility is based on the youth without considering parents or legal guardians. Youth in extended care must have entered via court order or voluntary placement agreement. Removal criteria for youth over 18 are specified in the program instructions. The program instructions state that youth age 18 or older entering or reentering care must have entered via court order or voluntary placement agreement. The instructions address removal criteria for youth over 18, allowing for court determination or voluntary placement agreement as guardian if it meets Title IV-E requirements. The instructions specify that youth age 18 or older can enter care through a court determination or voluntary placement agreement meeting Title IV-E requirements. A judicial determination is required if Title IV-E payments extend beyond the first 180 days of the agreement. State and tribal child welfare agencies are also addressed in the instructions. IV-E requirements for voluntary placement agreements require a judicial determination for Title IV-E payments extending beyond 180 days. State and tribal child welfare agencies can meet placement and care rules for older youth through written authorization or court order. Youth in extended care can be placed in supervised independent living settings. State and tribal child welfare agencies can meet placement and care rules for older youth through written authorization or court order. Youth in extended care can be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations for independent living settings. The program instructions advise that states and tribes can develop supervised independent living settings for older youth in care, without specific regulations from HHS at this time. The instructions allow states and tribes to create supervised independent living settings for older youth in care, with flexibility on licensing and safety protocols. Eligible settings include host homes, college dorms, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings form connections with caring adults. Child welfare agencies are instructed to ensure youth in supervised independent living settings form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. Child welfare agencies are advised to help youth in independent living settings form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in these settings. States and tribes must apply the same case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care as they do for children under 18. Child welfare agencies must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care, including those in independent living settings. The case plan should be developed jointly with the youth, include benchmarks for achieving independence, and involve periodic reviews every six months to ensure the youth's safety in their placement. States and tribes are advised to support connections with caring adults and can provide Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments directly to young people in independent living settings. The case plan for youth age 18 and older should be developed jointly with the youth, include benchmarks for achieving independence, and involve periodic reviews every six months to ensure safety in placement. States and tribes are advised to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth, reflecting the goal of emancipation or independence. The guidance advises states and tribes to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in foster care, reflecting the goal of emancipation or independence. The court can determine efforts to finalize the plan without a hearing if authorized by a judiciary member. The court overseeing a child's case in foster care can determine efforts to finalize a permanency plan without a hearing, as allowed by law. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill certain federal foster care requirements for those youth. The guidance advises states and tribes extending care to ineligible youth that they are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements, including case planning and data collection, for these youth. IV-E eligible children in foster care are also eligible for Medicaid, which should be extended to youth remaining in care after age 18. The guidance advises states and tribes to extend Medicaid eligibility to youth in foster care who remain in care after age 18. Nearly half of jurisdictions have amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend the maximum age of foster care, with 18 states' plans approved by HHS. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions have extended foster care until age 21 in their Title IV-E state plans. HHS approved plan amendments for 18 states and the District of Columbia, with two other states under review. Indiana extends care to age 20 and Nebraska to age 19. In May 2014, HHS approved plan amendments for 18 states and the District of Columbia, with two other states under review. Indiana extends care to age 20 and Nebraska to age 19, but Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to 21, which is currently under review by HHS. Except for three states, all approved plan amendments allow youth to remain in care until age 21. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to age 21, and HHS is reviewing this change. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have approved plan amendments allowing youth to remain in care under certain conditions, with exemptions for medical reasons. Tennessee requires youth to be in school or a program addressing employment barriers, or unable to do so for medical reasons. Washington and West Virginia limit care to eligible youth completing high school or a program. Some states allow youth to remain in care if they are in school, participating in a program to address employment barriers, or unable to do so for medical reasons. Factors to consider include outcomes of youth in care, costs, which youth can stay, court oversight, and rethinking the process. In considering the option to extend care for youth in foster care, states and tribes need to evaluate various factors such as outcomes, costs, court oversight, and rethinking the process. This includes determining which youth can stay in care, the role of the courts, and the type of placements that qualify as independent living settings. The research literature on youth who emancipate from care\u2014or stay in care beyond age 18\u2014is scarce, with the Midwest Evaluation being one of the few studies in this area. The study shows that youth who remained in care as late as age 20 had somewhat more positive outcomes than those who emancipated at age 18. The Midwest Evaluation study examined outcomes for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Youth who remained in care until age 20 had more positive outcomes compared to those who emancipated at age 18. Iowa and Wisconsin emancipated most foster youth by age 18, while Illinois kept three-fourths in care until age 21. The Midwest Evaluation study compared outcomes for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Remaining in care until age 21 in Illinois was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 in Illinois was linked to a $470 increase in average annual earnings. The Midwest Evaluation study found that remaining in care until age 21 in Illinois was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was linked to a $470 increase in average annual earnings, with longer stays resulting in a $924 increase in earnings after controlling for certain characteristics. The Midwest Evaluation study found that youth in Illinois who remained in care longer experienced an increase in average annual earnings. Additionally, they were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19 compared to their peers. The study found that youth in Illinois who remained in care longer had higher earnings and were less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. They were also more likely to receive transitional living services between ages 19 and 21. However, the benefits of remaining in care seemed to diminish two years after aging out, with no significant difference in college completion rates by age 23. The study found that youth in Illinois who remained in care longer were more likely to receive transitional living services between ages 19 and 21 funded through the CFCIP. By age 23, they were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a two- or four-year degree, possibly due to losing access to supportive services. The study found that youth in Illinois who remained in care longer were more likely to receive transitional living services funded through the CFCIP. By age 23, they were more likely to have completed one year of college, but not more likely to have earned a two- or four-year degree. Researchers suggest that losing access to supportive services may have hindered their educational goals. Additionally, challenges exist in providing necessary support for these young people, such as academic and social/emotional assistance. States face challenges in extending care to youth aging out of foster care due to budget constraints. Assistance programs may not provide necessary academic and social/emotional support for these individuals. States face challenges in extending care to youth aging out of foster care due to budget constraints. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group of stakeholders to review federal requirements. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests that states convene a planning group of stakeholders to review federal requirements and options for extending care to youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood. Key design issues should be agreed upon, including eligibility criteria, living settings, and case management. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative recommends convening a planning group to review federal requirements and options for extending care to youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood. Key design issues, such as eligibility criteria, living settings, and case management, should be agreed upon. Additionally, it is important to consider existing supports and services, seek input from young people, project costs and revenues, and determine next steps for youth remaining in foster care after age 18. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies on extending care or providing transitional living services to offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. Studies suggest that extending foster care or providing transitional living services can offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. One study evaluated the cost to government and benefits to youth of extending foster care based on Illinois data. Researchers evaluated the cost of extending foster care based on Illinois data, estimating it to be about $20,800 annually. Benefits to youth were assessed in terms of additional wages they could earn. Researchers estimated the cost of extending foster care in Illinois to be about $20,800 annually, with potential benefits for youth in terms of increased earnings from attending college. The analysis found an average return of $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over their lifetime. The analysis found that youth remaining in care could earn an average of approximately $72,000 more over their lifetime, with an average return of $2 for every $1 spent. The analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or potential societal benefits. The analysis did not consider the costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, such as additional time for caseworkers and hiring more personnel. It also did not examine potential benefits of extending care, like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. Providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a significant consideration for most states. The cost of providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a significant consideration for most states, with only partial reimbursement from the federal government for state foster care expenditures. Eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments varies by state, and nonmarket benefits include improved personal and familial health choices for former foster youth. The federal government only partially reimburses state foster care expenditures for Title IV-E eligible children and youth, based on specific criteria including income/assets tests, family structure rules, judicial determinations, and placement requirements. IV-E eligible children and youth are eligible for Title IV-E based on income/assets tests, family structure rules, judicial determinations, and placement requirements. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 73%. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 73%. Reimbursement rates for program administration and training costs are also specified. The federal government does not explicitly require states to make foster care maintenance payments for children ineligible for federal foster care. States that choose to extend care incur expenses. The federal government does not explicitly require states to make foster care maintenance payments for children ineligible for federal foster care. States may choose to cover only youth who are IV-E eligible, with reimbursement rates for program administration and training costs set at 50% and 75% respectively. States are expected to pay the full costs for children who do not meet Title IV-E eligibility criteria from state or local treasuries or other federal funding sources. States may choose to extend care only to youth who are IV-E eligible, with full costs covered for those who do not meet the criteria from state or local treasuries or other federal funding sources. Extending care based on eligibility criteria may raise equity concerns, potentially leading to different levels of reimbursement and services for youth. Extending care only to certain youth who meet eligibility criteria may raise equity concerns. States can establish different levels of reimbursement and services for eligible youth who remain in care after age 18 by attending school, working, or participating in employment programs. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting certain criteria such as attending school, working, or participating in employment programs. States can make remaining in care conditional on pursuing specific pathways, potentially raising equity concerns if certain opportunities are excluded. HHS advises states and tribes to make remaining in foster care conditional on pursuing specific pathways, potentially raising equity concerns if certain opportunities are excluded, such as restricting eligibility based on activities. This could limit opportunities for youth who choose not to attend college or work immediately. Federal child welfare law allows states to provide extended care options for youth who may not choose college immediately, potentially creating disparities in opportunities for youth in care. Youth attending college may already have advantages over those who do not pursue higher education or choose to work instead. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of placements for children in care. Federal child welfare law empowers state courts to oversee the safety and appropriateness of placements for children in care, ensuring each child has a suitable permanency goal. Case reviews must be conducted every six months by a judge or administrative panel. The child welfare law allows state courts to oversee placements for children in care, ensuring appropriate permanency goals. Case reviews are conducted every six months to assess safety and progress towards addressing the reasons for removal. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of a child entering foster care. The child welfare law mandates regular reviews of a child's placement and progress towards addressing the reasons for removal. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of entering foster care, with ongoing reviews every 12 months thereafter. The court must review the permanency plan for a child in care every 12 months, consulting with the child in an age-appropriate manner. HHS guidelines ensure that all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility, receive case review system protections. The court must consult with the child about the permanency plan in an age-appropriate manner, regardless of IV-E eligibility. HHS program instructions state that case review system protections apply to all children under 18 and to those in care age 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. The Departmental policy allows states to exclude children who have reached the state's age of majority and are not receiving Title IV-E payments from court oversight. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under a voluntary placement agreement, but a case review must be conducted every six months. States extending care to youth beyond age 18 may establish different levels of services based on IV-E eligibility. In states extending care to youth beyond age 18, different levels of services may be established based on IV-E eligibility. Non-IV-E eligible youth may not have the same level of oversight and supervision, leading to potential differences in services and supports provided. Non-IV-E eligible youth in extended care may not receive the same level of oversight and supervision as IV-E eligible youth, leading to potential differences in services provided. This lack of information about non-IV-E youth hinders policymakers from ensuring all young adults in extended care have their needs met. Additionally, there is a question of jurisdiction for juvenile courts over cases involving youth who legally become adults at age 18. The American Bar Association (ABA) has recommended legislation to ensure juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18. This addresses the issue of jurisdiction for cases involving young adults who legally become adults at 18. The American Bar Association recommends legislation to extend juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18. They suggest that states enact laws to ensure accountability and encourage courts to involve older youth in their hearings as the lead planner. The American Bar Association recommends extending juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18, ensuring accountability and encouraging their active participation in hearings. Stakeholders advocate for reconceptualizing support for youth in foster care at age 18 and older. Some stakeholders believe that foster care for youth aged 18 and older should offer different supports than those received at a younger age. States are urged to rethink their current models for older youth in care. The Jim Casey Foundation emphasizes that while foster youth want to leave a system that hasn't met their needs, they also face anxiety about the changes at age 18. Foster youth aged 18 and older may have anxiety about leaving a system that hasn't met their needs. They transition from having little control to being on their own, aging out suddenly without gradual growth opportunities. Simply extending traditional foster care will not adequately support them. Young people in foster care face challenges when they age out of the system at 18, transitioning from limited control to independence suddenly. Simply extending traditional foster care is not enough to provide the necessary support for them to become healthy and productive adults. Extended care for foster youth should be developmentally appropriate, tailored towards young adults rather than children. Extended care for foster youth should be developmentally appropriate, geared towards young adults, and consider the trauma they have faced. It should enable them to be involved in decisions about their lives, based on research showing a \"second window\" of neurological growth in adolescents and young adults. Extended care for foster youth should be developmentally appropriate for young adults, considering the trauma they have faced. Research on adolescent brain development highlights the need for strong social supports during the transition to adulthood, allowing youth to learn from mistakes and take on increasing responsibility. Extended care for young people transitioning to adulthood emphasizes the importance of strong social supports, opportunities to learn from mistakes, and developing permanent connections and healthy relationships. This approach involves graduated levels of supervision and support for youth in care. Extended care for young people transitioning to adulthood focuses on helping them identify and maintain permanent connections while developing skills for healthy relationships with family, friends, and others. This approach empowers young people to choose who they want to connect with and may involve graduated levels of supervision and support. Case planning may be redesigned to involve young people in decision-making and provide experiences that increase their autonomy. Extended care for young people transitioning to adulthood involves providing supervision and support, redesigning case planning, and helping them build social networks. Research also focuses on factors that help young people remain in extended care, such as identifying reasons for youth not staying in care in certain areas of Illinois. In Illinois, the Cook County region, including Chicago, has a high percentage of youth remaining in care beyond age 18, with over 81% staying in care and nearly 60% remaining until age 21. In Illinois, the Cook County region, including Chicago, has a high percentage of youth remaining in care beyond age 18, with over 81% staying in care and nearly 60% remaining until age 21. Child welfare services are administered by the Department of Child and Family Services' four regional offices, with varying retention rates across regions. Chapin Hall evaluated factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 through data analysis, surveys, and focus groups. In Illinois, the Cook County region has high retention rates for youth in care, with over 81% staying beyond age 18 and nearly 60% remaining until age 21. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were identified through data analysis, surveys, and focus groups conducted by Chapin Hall. These factors include the active role of some juvenile courts in retaining youth and resistance from stakeholders involved in the case. The study identified factors influencing youth retention in care, including juvenile courts playing an active role in keeping cases open, stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws, and regions with few suitable foster care placements for older youth. Factors influencing youth retention in care include stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws and policies, regions with limited foster care placements for older youth, the importance of stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards staying in care beyond the age of majority. In Illinois, youth who have stable relationships with adults tend to stay in care longer. Youth attitudes about staying in care beyond the age of majority can be a challenge, with some requesting to leave due to restrictions imposed by their case worker. These factors may be relevant to states that do not extend care beyond age 18. In Illinois, youth may want to leave foster care due to restrictions from their case worker. States that do not extend care beyond age 18 may face similar challenges. States can now extend foster care assistance to allow youth to return to care if needed. The July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS allow states to extend foster care assistance for youth to return to care after age 18, depending on the state's regulations. The Government Accountability Office examined states' implementation of the Fostering Connections Act in 2014. States can extend foster care assistance for youth to return to care after age 18, up to age 19, 20, or 21, depending on the state's regulations. In a 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office found that 19 states allow young people to leave and re-enter care, with 12 states offering voluntary placement agreements for youth over 18 in supervised settings. In 19 states, young people can leave and re-enter foster care, with 12 states offering voluntary placement agreements for those over 18 in supervised settings. HHS has not issued regulations on independent living settings as of July 2010. The law does not provide guidance on independent living settings for youth in care after age 18, with HHS signaling no plans to issue regulations at this time. Child welfare agencies continue to supervise youth in these settings, where parents or guardians are not foster care providers and reunification has not occurred. The instructions do not provide guidance on independent living settings for youth in care after age 18. Child welfare agencies supervise youth in these settings, where parents or guardians are not foster care providers and reunification has not occurred. States could establish distinct protocols for supervising older youth in care, emphasizing the importance of young adults learning to live independently while still receiving support. States could establish distinct protocols for supervising older youth in care in independent living settings. Advocates assert that young adults in care should learn to live independently while still receiving state support. Issues to consider include whether the child welfare agency should purchase independent living units and how to screen other individuals living with youth in care. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues such as purchasing independent living units, screening individuals living with youth in care, determining youth's financial responsibilities, frequency of case worker visits, consequences for violating lease terms, and flexibility in placement restrictions. States with foster youth in independent living settings must address questions regarding rent and utilities coverage, frequency of case worker visits, consequences for lease violations, flexibility in placement options, and management of maintenance payments for youth. In independent living settings for foster youth, questions arise about rent, utilities, case worker visits, consequences for lease violations, and managing maintenance payments. States face challenges in finding suitable housing options for these youth transitioning into independent living. In states with extended care for foster youth, supervised independent living settings are provided to help with transitioning back into the home. Challenges exist in finding appropriate housing options for these youth, with Minnesota allowing them to live in apartments, homes, dorms, and other settings. The state is also working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Minnesota allows foster youth aged 18 and older to live in various settings such as apartments, homes, and dorms. The state is determining how to support youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state, with caseworkers required to meet them monthly. Youth can have roommates but not live with parents or significant others. Independent living settings do not need to be licensed, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates and safety concerns. The state allows foster youth aged 18 and older to live independently, with the requirement of monthly meetings with caseworkers. Youth can have roommates but not live with parents or significant others. Independent living settings do not need to be licensed, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth after they turn 18. As of FY2011, states and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21 and enrolled in school. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21 and meet certain criteria like being enrolled in school or employed. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21 and meet certain criteria like being enrolled in school, employed, or participating in activities to promote employment. Assistance can also be extended for older youth with medical conditions that prevent participation in these activities, or for those with mental or physical handicaps that warrant continued support. The state or tribe can provide assistance up to the 21st birthday for children who left foster care after their 16th birthday, based on certain criteria. This assistance can be extended for youth with medical conditions or mental/physical handicaps. The program instructions from HHS in July 2010 allow states to extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older, up to the age the state has chosen. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties or broader tribal kin, extended family, and friends. States can extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties, tribal kin, extended family, and friends. Conditions can be established for a person to qualify as a child's guardian, such as requiring the child to be in care for more than six months and targeting specific age groups for guardianship. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides funding for services to assist youth expected to emancipate from foster care. States and tribes can establish conditions for guardianship, such as requiring a child to be in care for over six months and targeting specific age groups. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth expected to emancipate from foster care, targeting specific age groups for guardianship. The program aims to provide support services for transitioning to self-sufficiency, employment, postsecondary education, and emotional support through mentors and dedicated adults. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth aging out of foster care, providing support for transitioning to self-sufficiency, employment, education, and emotional support through mentors and dedicated adults. P.L. 110-351 enables states and tribes to enhance efforts for former foster youth ages 18 to 21 to achieve self-sufficiency through various supports. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth aging out of foster care, providing support for transitioning to self-sufficiency, employment, education, and emotional support through mentors and dedicated adults. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to provide independent living services to former foster youth aged 18 to 21, helping them connect to employment, education, housing, and other services, and encouraging personal responsibility for transitioning to adulthood. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a purpose area to the Chafee program to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 have opportunities for appropriate activities. The CFCIP is a capped entitlement with an annual ceiling of $140 million for states and tribes based on their share. The Chafee program, effective one year after enactment, ensures foster care children have opportunities for appropriate activities. CFCIP is a capped entitlement with a $140 million annual ceiling for states and tribes based on their share of the foster care population. States must provide a 20% match, and with funding from CFCIP and other sources, they have developed independent living programs. States receive funding based on their share of the foster care population, with a minimum amount set. They must provide a 20% match and have developed independent living programs with services like housing, education, counseling, and mentoring for youth. Eligibility for funds requires a description of programs in a five-year plan. States and tribes have developed independent living programs to provide direct services to youth such as housing, career exploration, education, preventative health activities, counseling, mentoring, and financial management training. To be eligible for CFCIP funds, they must describe how they will implement their program in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages and stages of independence. States and tribes must outline their independent living program in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving youth of different ages and stages of independence. They must also certify that they meet specific requirements, such as limiting the use of program funds for youth room and board to no more than 30%. Additionally, the Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) was authorized in 2001. States and tribes must certify in their plans that they meet requirements for serving youth and spending funds. For example, no more than 30% of program funds can be used for the room and board of youth ages 18 to 21. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides support for children who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. Congress authorized $60 million in discretionary funds for the program. The Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001 (P.L. 107-133) and P.L. 110-351 provide support for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted at age 16 or older, including vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for higher education costs. Congress allocated $60 million in discretionary funds for the program, with approximately $45 million appropriated each year. The program provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for higher education costs, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board. Eligible youth must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. The Education Act of 1965 allows students to receive vouchers for higher education costs, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board. Eligible students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. Youth receiving a voucher at age 21 can continue in the program until age 23. States can also provide independent living services to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. States can provide independent living services to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18, in addition to the traditional CFCIP population. These services focus on connecting youth to school, work, and resources and may be available until age 21. States have discretion in defining eligibility for CFCIP services. The population of foster youth aging out without a permanent home can receive independent living services until age 21. States have discretion in defining eligibility for these services, and may need to assess capacity to serve additional youth. They must also ensure youth participate in age-appropriate activities. States have broad discretion in defining eligibility for independent living services for foster youth aging out. They must assess capacity to serve additional youth and ensure participation in age-appropriate activities. Child welfare law mandates that a transition plan be developed with the youth's caseworker and other representatives. In FY2016, a new purpose area will be implemented before mandatory funding in FY2020. Child welfare law requires a transition plan for youth aging out of foster care, including options for housing, education, mentors, and employment services, to be developed 90 days before their 18th birthday. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include specific options on housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday, as mandated by child welfare law. Additionally, the plan must address requirements set forth by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires the plan to designate an individual to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to participate. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday. The plan must address designating an individual to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to participate, with the option to execute a health care power of attorney or similar document. The transition plan is separate from the required case plan for children and youth in foster care. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday and allows for designating a decision-maker for health care. This plan is distinct from the case plan required for children and youth in foster care, which outlines placement and care details. The case plan for children and youth in foster care describes placement and care details, while the transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. The transition plan must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday and includes a decision-maker for health care. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday and involves identifying specific options to help youth live independently, such as housing choices. The plan is directed by the youth in consultation with others. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before a youth's 18th birthday and involves identifying specific options to help youth live independently. The plan is directed by the youth in consultation with others and can be detailed as desired. The case plan is reviewed by a court during annual hearings to review permanency goals, while the transition plan is not reviewed by a court. Additional guidance on the transition plan is provided in July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS on P.L. 110-351. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care, directed by the youth in consultation with others, includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday and aims to help them live independently. The case plan is reviewed by a court during annual hearings for permanency goals, while the transition plan is not reviewed by a court. Additional guidance on the transition plan is provided in July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS on P.L. 110-351. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to engage youth in the transition plan process well in advance of the 90-day period before their 18th birthday. Questions arise for youth who emancipate at an earlier age. The transition plan process for youth aging out of foster care should be initiated well before the 90-day period before their 18th birthday. Questions arise for youth who emancipate at an earlier age, as they may not be as prepared as their peers who emancipate at ages 18 or older. Youth emancipating from care at age 17 may be less prepared than those emancipating at 18 or older. States and tribes may not provide transition plans for youth leaving care between ages 18 and 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance for implementing transition plans. States and tribes may not provide transition plans for youth leaving care between ages 18 and 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance for implementing transition plans that focus on engaging youth and stakeholders in the process to achieve permanency with caring adults. The guidance emphasizes engaging youth and stakeholders in the transition planning process to achieve permanency with caring adults. Plans should be developed with the strengths of young people in mind, directed by the youth, and encourage collaboration among service providers and those closest to the youth. The guidance emphasizes developing plans with the strengths of young people in mind, directed by the youth, and encouraging collaboration among service providers and those closest to the youth. States have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning and provide essential supports during the transition from foster care. In a 2014 report, GAO found that states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care. Nearly all jurisdictions require youth input on the plan and ensuring key documents are included. Some jurisdictions have a separate transition plan and provide specialists to assist youth, despite facing challenges. In 35 jurisdictions, the transition plan must be separate from other planning efforts. More than half require a specialist to assist youth with the plan. Challenges include staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing for transitioning youth. In several jurisdictions, challenges with transition planning include a lack of staff training or time to engage youth effectively, identifying and involving supportive adults in the process, and finding suitable housing for transitioning youth. Hawaii and Nebraska have developed detailed transition planning processes, such as holding \"circles\" in Hawaii to celebrate the young person becoming an adult and plan for their future. In Hawaii, transition planning \"circles\" are held to celebrate youth becoming adults and assist in planning for their future. These conferences are youth-driven and involve their support system to generate options and resources for decision-making and goal achievement. Foster Club advocates for youth in foster care. Transition planning circles in Hawaii celebrate youth becoming adults and help them plan for their future. Foster Club in Nebraska has developed a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, outlining roles of the transition plan team and courts in oversight, including a transition proposal checklist revisited at six months and 90 days before aging out. Foster Club in Nebraska has created a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, detailing the roles of the transition plan team and courts in oversight. It includes a transition proposal checklist revisited at six months and 90 days before aging out, as well as a \"permanency pact\" for youth to identify individuals who can support them during their transition. The \"permanency pact\" in the transition planning kit for older youth in foster care helps them identify individuals who can provide support during their transition to adulthood. Despite policy changes, concerns remain about the challenges faced by older foster youth as they age out of the system. Research shows that youth struggle to establish lasting connections with caring adults and secure health insurance. Even with policy changes, concerns persist about challenges faced by older foster youth transitioning to adulthood. Research shows they struggle to form lasting connections with adults, secure health insurance, housing, and stay connected to work and school. Limited knowledge exists on their transition outcomes and the effectiveness of services received. Limited knowledge exists on the transition outcomes of older foster youth as they age out of care, including their connections with caring adults, health insurance, housing, and education and employment. A new national database may shed light on their outcomes in various areas. Congress is also focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, particularly regarding sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183), enacted in September 2014, aims to address issues faced by youth aging out of foster care, such as lack of permanent relationships with caring adults and continued contact with biological families. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth found that youth who aged out of foster care are more likely to be married at age 26 compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth found that at age 26, youth who emancipated from care were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents. They also reported being estranged from their biological families, with only about half feeling close to their parents, grandparents, or other relatives. Former foster youth who emancipated from care at age 26 were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents. They reported being estranged from their biological families, with only about half feeling close to their parents, grandparents, or other relatives. This suggests a significant share of former foster youth did not have strong relationships with some relatives after leaving care. Despite federal protections, child welfare practitioners and former foster youth advocate for additional policies to improve the transition to adulthood by fostering strong, long-term connections with caring adults. These connections can provide emotional, financial, and other support for youth to achieve successful outcomes. In some jurisdictions, child welfare agencies play an active role in ensuring permanent adult connections for emancipated youth. Child welfare practitioners advocate for policies that promote strong, long-term connections with caring adults to help youth achieve successful outcomes. In some jurisdictions, child welfare agencies ensure permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care, providing a safe, stable, and secure relationship. Practitioners emphasize the importance of permanency for youth in foster care, which involves having a committed adult providing a safe and stable relationship. They suggest ways to help youth establish permanent connections during the transition to adulthood. Practitioners stress the significance of permanency for foster youth, advising on ways to help them form lasting connections with adults. This includes reconsidering the need for \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" goal, assisting in identifying permanent connections, supporting adoptive relationships, and fostering relationships with caring adults like teachers or mentors. Researchers caution against policies that may hinder the development of lasting connections for youth in care. Child welfare researchers caution practitioners to be careful in promoting lasting connections for foster youth, as failed relationships with adults can harm them. Limited research exists on the best ways to help youth develop sustainable relationships. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before youth leave care, as research shows they often maintain contact with their biological family. Limited research exists on fostering healthy relationships between foster youth and their family members. This could be achieved through the case planning process and annual permanency hearings. Limited research exists on fostering healthy relationships between foster youth and their family members. Permanency planning should be initiated before a youth leaves care through the case planning process and annual permanency hearings. The judge determines the permanency plan for the child, including goals like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these are possible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be selected. The judge determines the permanency plan for the child, including goals like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these are possible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be selected, with a compelling reason documented for not choosing other goals. APPLA was added to the statute as part of reforms enacted in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. APPLA was added to the statute as part of reforms in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to provide a permanent arrangement for children in foster care when other goals are not feasible. It aims to prevent frequent moves and instability for the child. Advocates envisioned APPLA as a permanent arrangement for a child, involving a specific adult or couple to care for the child long-term, rather than using it as a temporary solution. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a replacement for long-term foster care, contrary to its intended purpose. Since its enactment, concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care, instead of as a long-term solution involving a specific adult or couple. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth has cautioned against pursuing certain settings like group care unless there is clear evidence that a young person cannot function in a family before reaching emancipation. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth has highlighted concerns about APPLA being used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care. They advise against pursuing group care settings unless there is clear evidence that a young person cannot function in a family before reaching emancipation. In 2010, the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, co-chaired by Senators Grassley and Landrieu, issued a white paper suggesting policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. One recommendation was to eliminate or restrict APPLA as a case plan goal, especially for older teenagers in care. The white paper recommended eliminating or restricting APPLA as a case plan goal for older teenagers in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act incorporated some of these recommendations. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. Effective one year after enactment, except for children under tribal care, where it is three years. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. Effective one year after enactment, except for children under tribal care, where it is three years. If a child is assigned APPLA, the state must meet additional requirements during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews in foster care to find a permanent family. The state must meet additional requirements for children with an APPLA permanency plan during annual hearings and periodic reviews in foster care to find a permanent family. This ensures ongoing consideration of the child's permanency plan, consultation with the child about their desired outcome, and participation in appropriate activities.

This includes ongoing consideration of the child's permanency plan, consultation with the child about their desired outcome, and participation in appropriate activities. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. The requirement aims to ensure youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities and making changes to federal child welfare law to assist youth in achieving permanency. This includes amending written case plan requirements to include steps for a permanent living arrangement after emancipation and documenting the living arrangement for older youth after foster care. Changes to federal child welfare law are proposed to assist youth in achieving permanency. This includes amending case plan requirements to document steps for a permanent living arrangement after emancipation and finding a permanent placement with a family or adult connection for older youth. The GAO surveyed states on the implementation of the Fostering Connections Act in 2014. The GAO surveyed states in 2014 on transition planning for youth aging out of foster care, finding that 36 jurisdictions require intensive efforts to establish adult connections for young people. Some states, like Texas, focus heavily on permanent connections during the transition process. During the transition process in Texas, youth receive assistance in identifying caring adults to provide support when they leave care. A youth is asked to identify someone over 18 to offer consistent and significant support, help make important decisions, and work through challenges. During the transition process in Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults to provide support when they leave care. A youth is asked to identify someone over 18 to offer consistent and significant support, help make important decisions, and work through challenges. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps youth aging out connect with supportive adults by defining a lifelong commitment to provide emotional and tangible support. The Permanency Pact by Foster Club aims to help youth aging out of care connect with caring adults by establishing a lifelong commitment for emotional and tangible support. Efforts to support permanency also include initiatives like Adoption Opportunity Grants for older youth. Efforts to support permanency for youth leaving care include Adoption Opportunity Grants for older youth, funded by HHS. These grants aim to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections through adoption, open adoption, guardianship, and kinship care. Efforts to support permanency for youth leaving care include Adoption Opportunity Grants funded by HHS. These grants aim to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections for youth, particularly through adoption, open adoption, guardianship, and kinship care. Federal grants could also provide mentoring for current and former foster youth, with legislation introduced in Congress seeking permanent authorization for such funding. Federal grants could be funded to provide mentoring for current and former foster youth, with legislation introduced in Congress seeking permanent authorization for such funding. The Department of Justice has provided funding for mentoring teens in care, and bills have proposed grants to states and other entities to support networks providing mentoring. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for implementing policies to promote the safety and well-being of foster children. The bills propose funding grants for mentoring foster children to support networks of public and private community entities. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety and well-being of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking and those in foster care due to abuse or neglect. Child victims of sex trafficking may be reported to the child welfare agency's CPS hotline. Children in foster care, often placed due to abuse or neglect, are vulnerable to trafficking, especially if they run away. State and local child welfare agencies may have limited capacity to respond to sex trafficking victims due to training, resources, and high caseloads. Child victims of sex trafficking, especially those who run away from foster care, are perceived to be vulnerable. State and local child welfare agencies may have limited capacity to respond to their needs due to various challenges such as inadequate training and resources. Additionally, there may be difficulties in identifying cases involving children who are sex trafficked if the perpetrator is not their parent or caregiver as defined by state law. Child victims of sex trafficking face challenges such as inadequate training, resources, and high caseloads. States may struggle to identify cases involving children who are trafficked by perpetrators who are not their parents or caregivers. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to address child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across multiple sectors to address child sex trafficking, as discussed in the 113th Congress hearings on child sex trafficking and the challenges faced by child welfare agencies. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on child sex trafficking and the challenges for child welfare agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was passed, amending the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to combat child sex trafficking. Child welfare agencies have taken steps to combat child sex trafficking, leading to the passage of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183). This act amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. Child welfare agencies are required to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking, in consultation with various stakeholders. These procedures must be developed within one year and implemented within two years of the bill's enactment. Child welfare agencies must develop procedures to identify and assist at-risk children and youth, including training for caseworkers. Within two years of the bill's enactment, state agencies must report child sex trafficking cases to law enforcement within 24 hours. Additionally, within three years, agencies must provide annual reports on their efforts. The law requires state child welfare agencies to report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement immediately or within 24 hours. Within three years, agencies must report the total number of sex trafficking victims to HHS annually, which will then report to Congress and the public within four years. Child welfare agencies must report the total number of children and youth who are sex trafficking victims annually to HHS. HHS is required to report this information to Congress and the public within four years. Additionally, HHS must submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for victims of sex trafficking within two years. The law P.L. 113-183 requires HHS to report demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for child victims of sex trafficking to Congress within two years. HHS must also establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days after the bill's enactment. Under the law P.L. 113-183, HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days after the bill's enactment. The committee advises the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on policies to improve the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system and recommends best practices for states to combat domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress may monitor state implementation of these requirements in the coming years. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking advises HHS and the Attorney General on policies to enhance the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system. Congress may monitor state implementation of these requirements in the future. Key considerations include HHS guidance to states, serving youth not in foster care, and the number of reported victims. State child welfare agencies must serve children and youth victims of sex trafficking who are already in the child welfare system, with key considerations including HHS guidance, serving youth not in foster care, reported victims, and best practices for victim services. Pending legislation, such as H.R. 5081, would require state child welfare agencies to report the number of victims and implement best practices for serving these victims. Congress may consider whether agencies should also screen for potential victims not yet in the child welfare system. Pending legislation like H.R. 5081 would mandate state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. This includes training CPS workers to recognize and evaluate child victims of sex trafficking. Children removed from their homes due to abuse and neglect may end up in foster care. State child welfare agencies are required to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims and train CPS workers to recognize and evaluate child victims of sex trafficking. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Some child welfare stakeholders have sought a more uniform and robust response to children missing from care. The Child Welfare League of America conducted a survey in 2004 on children missing from foster care, revealing that many states have policies in place to prevent and recover missing children. Implementation of these policies varies across jurisdictions within states. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act directs state child welfare agencies on responding to missing children from foster care and involving other entities. It requires state agencies to develop protocols as part of their Title IV-E plan. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care. It emphasizes involving other entities and addressing factors contributing to a child running away or going missing from care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including addressing factors contributing to a child running away or going missing. These protocols must be implemented within one year of the law's enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including identifying potential sex trafficking victims and reporting relevant information to HHS, NCMEC, and law enforcement. These protocols must be established within one year of the law's enactment. State agencies are also required to report information on missing children to NCMEC and law enforcement for inclusion in the FBI's NCIC database. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including identifying potential sex trafficking victims. Best practice guidelines recommend that state child welfare agencies have procedures and policies in place to address children missing from care. Child welfare agencies are advised to have procedures in place to address children missing from care, including recruiting and training a competent workforce, involving relevant parties in decision-making, and examining operational structures. Child welfare agencies should have procedures in place to recruit, retain, and train a competent workforce, involve relevant parties in decision-making, and examine operational structures to address children missing from care. States should also define missing and report all cases accordingly. Child welfare agencies should examine foster and group homes with high runaway rates and take corrective action. States need to define missing children and consider reporting all cases to law enforcement. States should consider defining missing children and determining whether all missing children, even those with known whereabouts, should be reported to law enforcement. This decision should take into account the limited resources of law enforcement agencies and prioritize cases where their involvement would be most beneficial. States may need to restrict reporting missing children from care to law enforcement due to competing demands and limited resources. Law enforcement agencies may not respond as vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, for various reasons. Law enforcement agencies may not respond as vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, due to competing demands and various factors. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and the courts can help prevent children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy addresses this issue. The coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and the courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy provides some general requirements for collaboration, which can serve as a starting point for needed efforts. The CWLA Best Practices guidelines and those from NCMEC also emphasize the importance of collaboration in addressing missing children cases. The CWLA Best Practices guidelines and NCMEC guidelines stress the importance of collaboration between law enforcement and child welfare agencies in addressing missing children cases. State child welfare agencies are required to report on the number of children who run away from foster care placements. NCMEC and state child welfare agencies collaborate to address missing children cases, emphasizing clear roles and definitions. AFCARS system tracks children who run away from foster care, but lacks reporting for other reasons children may go missing. The AFCARS system tracks children who run away from foster care placements and those who remain in runaway status upon discharge. However, it does not have a separate reporting category for children who go missing for other reasons. States may need to improve tracking to locate children who are no longer living where they were placed by child welfare agencies, including those who were abducted or are otherwise missing. Child welfare stakeholders have concerns about limiting foster youth's participation in normal activities due to safety policies. This issue was discussed at a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing. States may need to improve tracking to locate children who are missing or abducted from child welfare placements. Child welfare stakeholders are worried about restrictions on foster youth's normal activities due to safety policies. Testimonies at a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing highlighted limitations such as no sleepovers, dating, phone use, driver's license, driving, work, school trips, and sports participation. Witnesses testified about the restrictions foster youth face, such as limitations on activities like sleepovers, dating, phone use, driving, work, school trips, and sports participation. Youth may need background screenings for certain activities, and their desire for independence may lead to risky behaviors. Witnesses testified about the restrictions foster youth face, such as limitations on activities like sleepovers, dating, phone use, driving, work, school trips, and sports participation. Youth may need background screenings for certain activities, and their desire for independence may lead to risky behaviors, as teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. Teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act includes provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care. Congress will monitor the implementation of these provisions. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. Congress will monitor the implementation of these provisions. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to make decisions that allow children in care to participate in appropriate activities. HHS will assist states in identifying best practices for implementing the standard, and child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages and applying the standard. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to make decisions that allow children in care to participate in appropriate activities. States must revise licensing standards for foster family homes and child care institutions to reflect provisions around normalcy and provide training on children's developmental stages and applying the standard. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to allow children in care to participate in appropriate activities. States are required to revise licensing standards for foster family homes and child care institutions to reflect provisions around normalcy, including addressing the lack of adequate and affordable housing for youth aging out of foster care. Studies have shown varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth, ranging from 11% to 36%. A major concern for youth aging out of foster care is the lack of adequate and affordable housing. Studies have found that 11% to 36% of former foster youth experience homelessness, with some resorting to couch surfing at the homes of family and friends. The Midwest Evaluation reported that 24% of 23-year-olds had been homeless at least once since exiting care. Former foster youth face challenges with housing stability, with 24% of 23-year-olds experiencing homelessness after exiting care. Many also resort to couch surfing, staying with family or friends due to lack of permanent housing. Individual characteristics and involvement with the child welfare system play a role in their housing status. Estimates show that a significant portion of emancipated youth couch surf, with factors like lack of financial support, ties to family, early parenthood, and involvement with the juvenile justice system affecting their housing status. Transitioning from the child welfare system to adulthood can be challenging, leading to difficulties in securing affordable housing. Homeless youth may struggle to stay in school or maintain employment. Former foster youth face challenges in securing affordable housing due to lack of preparation in transitioning to adulthood, coordination with other support systems, and the high cost of housing. While states can allocate funds for room and board, it may not be sufficient. Nonprofit organizations may offer housing programs for former foster youth. Former foster youth may have access to housing programs operated by nonprofit organizations, sometimes in combination with a housing developer or property management agency. Researchers found that these programs provide housing options in single-site and scattered-site locations. In a review of nearly 60 housing programs for former foster youth, researchers found options such as single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. These programs focus on providing independent living supports and require youth to be working or in school. None of the programs have been rigorously evaluated. Most housing programs for former foster youth offer independent living supports and require youth to be employed or in school. These programs include single-site, scattered-site, and host home options. However, none of these programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. Some states face challenges in providing appropriate housing options for current and former foster youth, especially during school breaks when college facilities are closed. California law requires public universities to offer housing for these youth. Some states struggle to find suitable housing for current and former foster youth, particularly during college breaks when campus facilities are closed. California law mandates public universities to address housing issues for emancipated foster youth in college dormitories throughout the academic year, including vacations. California law requires public universities to review housing issues for emancipated foster youth in college dormitories throughout the academic year, including vacations, to ensure basic housing. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, including housing services, through Student Support Services. The Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, including housing services, through Student Support Services. This includes temporary housing during breaks in the academic year and allows for additional uses of funds to establish demonstration projects providing comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care or homeless. The Higher Education Act allows for additional uses of funds to establish demonstration projects providing comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care or homeless, including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. This includes housing for youth when housing at an educational institution is closed or unavailable to other students. However, universities and colleges are not required to use funds from these programs for this purpose. The Higher Education Act allows for demonstration projects to provide housing for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13 when housing at educational institutions is closed. However, universities and colleges are not obligated to use funds from these programs for this purpose. Additionally, owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits can designate units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. Federal law allows owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to designate units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. The law does not specify the length of time students must have spent in foster care or require that they be emancipated. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking family or support networks. Youth in care and certain other groups are at higher risk of becoming disconnected. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking family or support networks. Youth in care and certain other groups are at higher risk of becoming disconnected. A study linked child welfare, Unemployment Insurance (UI), and public assistance data to show that youth who aged out of care have low employment rates and earnings. At age 24, about three out of five aged-out youth in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina were not employed. A study of youth who aged out of care in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina found that at age 24, three out of five were working, with lower earnings compared to youth nationally. Emancipated youth had substantially lower average monthly earnings than their counterparts, who earned $1,535 a month on average. Emancipated youth who aged out of care in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina had lower earnings and were less likely to be working compared to youth nationally. They also faced challenges in education, including multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent education advocacy. Young people in foster care face challenges in education, including multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent education advocacy. Foster care alumni have lower college attendance rates compared to the general youth population. By age 26, only about 7% of youth who aged out of care attained an associate's or bachelor's degree, while one-third of the general youth population had the same. Foster care alumni face challenges in education, with only about 7% attaining a degree by age 26. Additional supports such as academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance, including year-round housing, may be beneficial. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in foster care. Young foster care alumni may require additional supports to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance, as well as year-round housing. Federal child welfare law mandates that state agencies consider the proximity of a child's placement in foster care to their school. State child welfare agencies must consider the proximity of a child's placement in foster care to their school and include education-related records in the child's case plan. They are also required to collaborate with state and local education authorities to ensure the child remains in the same school. The welfare agency must include education-related records in the child's case plan, collaborate with education authorities to keep the child in the same school, or enroll them in a new school if necessary. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin.\" The law allows states to claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" to ensure continuity in education for children in foster care. States must also ensure that children receiving federal foster care maintenance payments are enrolled in school. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations, including ensuring that children in foster care are enrolled in school or have completed high school, and that educational records are provided to foster care parents at each placement. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations, including ensuring that children in foster care are enrolled in school or have completed high school. Educational records must be reviewed, updated, and supplied to foster care parents at each placement. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education convened a summit in November 2011 to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Despite collaboration, federal education law does not address their needs. Recent legislation aims to enhance education access for children and youth in foster care. Recent legislation, such as S. 1094, aims to improve educational outcomes for children in foster care by amending federal education law to align with child welfare provisions. S. 1094 aims to improve educational outcomes for children in foster care by requiring state education agencies to ensure continuity in schooling or immediate enrollment in a new school when necessary. The bill requires state education agencies to ensure foster children stay in the same school or enroll in a new school if necessary. It also mandates policies for transferring school credits and receiving partial credit. Federal law addresses postsecondary educational needs of foster youth through the Higher Education Act. SEAs must have policies for transferring school credits for children in care changing schools. The Higher Education Act provides supportive services for foster youth, including eligibility for federal Trio programs. These programs offer mentoring and tutoring services. The Higher Education Act allows foster youth and homeless children to access federal Trio programs, which provide mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to help prepare them for higher education. The Trio programs offer mentoring, tutoring, and support services to disadvantaged youth to prepare them for higher education. These programs include Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers. Additionally, the FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. However, there is limited information on the effectiveness of these services and the outcomes of foster youth after they leave care. Studies on independent living programs have not been rigorous or shown to be effective in improving outcomes for youth. No national studies have provided a comprehensive picture of the success of these programs. Limited information exists on the effectiveness of independent living services for foster youth after they leave care. Studies have not shown significant improvements in outcomes, and there is a lack of national data on the transition to adulthood for former foster youth. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to provide insight into the lives of these youth, but full implementation is still pending. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main source of funding for independent living services for transition-age youth in and recently emancipated from foster care, with an annual appropriation of $140 million distributed to states based on their relative share. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) will offer insight into the lives of youth leaving care, but full implementation may take several years. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in and recently emancipated from foster care. States receive $140 million annually based on their share of children in care, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 31 states spend additional funds beyond the match to support independent living services. States receive funding for independent living services based on their share of children in care, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 31 states spend extra funds to support independent living services, indicating federal funding alone may not be sufficient. States can benefit from learning about effective services due to limited funding.

A 2008 survey found that 31 states spend extra funds to support independent living services, indicating federal funding alone may not be sufficient. States can benefit from learning about effective services due to limited funding. Research literature on independent living programs is scarce, but evaluations of innovative programs are being conducted by HHS. The research literature on independent living programs is scarce. HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate the effects of programs funded by P.L. 106-169 in achieving key outcomes. The Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs aimed to assess the impact of independent living programs funded by P.L. 106-169 on foster youth outcomes such as education, employment, interpersonal skills, pregnancy rates, and delinquency. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts, including employment services, life skills training, and tutoring/mentoring. The evaluation involved randomly assigning 1,400 eligible foster youth to four programs in California and Massachusetts\u2014an employment services program in Kern County, CA; a one-on-one intensive, individualized life skills program in Massachusetts; and a classroom-based life skills training program and tutoring/mentoring program, both in Los Angeles County, CA. The youth were surveyed at three points: baseline, one year after baseline, and two years after baseline, with in-person interviews conducted with the youth and program administrators. The evaluation involved 1,400 foster youth in California and Massachusetts assigned to different programs. Surveys were conducted at three points over two years, along with in-person interviews with various stakeholders. State administrative data was used to determine child and family demographics. The evaluation of foster youth programs in Los Angeles, Kern County, and Massachusetts involved interviews with stakeholders and analysis of state administrative data. While no significant impacts were found in Los Angeles and Kern County programs, the life skills program in Massachusetts showed positive impacts on education outcomes. The evaluation of foster youth programs in Los Angeles and Kern County found no significant impacts, while the life skills program in Massachusetts, known as Outreach, showed positive impacts on education outcomes for youth preparing to live independently. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, known as Outreach, aims to help youth achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding risky behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services emphasizing a youth development approach to empower positive decision-making. The Outreach program aims to help youth achieve outcomes like obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding risky behaviors, and gaining employment. Social workers oversee a small caseload of approximately 15 youth, providing regular interactions to develop a close relationship with each youth. The Outreach program empowers youth to make positive decisions about their lives by providing social workers who oversee a small caseload of approximately 15 youth. The workers aim to develop a close relationship with the youth, acting as their advocate and assisting them with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment. Caseworkers also refer youth to service providers as needed to help them transition to adulthood successfully. The evaluation of the Outreach program focused on educational, employment, and other outcomes for youth transitioning to adulthood. Outreach youth were more likely to enroll and stay in college, remain in foster care, and receive more help in various areas compared to the control group. The evaluation of the Outreach program found that youth transitioning to adulthood who participated were more likely to enroll and persist in college, remain in foster care, and receive additional support in educational and employment assistance, money management, and housing financial aid. Staying in care and pursuing higher education were closely linked, suggesting that remaining in care positively impacted educational outcomes for the Outreach youth. The evaluation of the Outreach program found that youth in the program received more help in educational and employment assistance, money management, and housing financial aid. Staying in care and enrolling in college were closely related, leading to better educational outcomes for the Outreach youth. However, the program did not show significant improvements in other areas such as employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living. This raises questions about the program's overall effectiveness. The evaluation of the Outreach program found that while youth received help in educational and employment assistance, money management, and housing financial aid, they did not show significant improvements in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living. This raises questions about the efficacy of independent living programs and the effectiveness of classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The Outreach program, which assigns case workers to transitioning youth, shows promise but did not result in better outcomes compared to foster youth in areas other than education and remaining in foster care. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth, providing insights into their outcomes. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth to identify promising approaches for serving these youth. States have reported information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act (P.L. 106-169). The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks outcomes of foster youth nationwide to identify effective approaches for serving them. States have reported required information to the database as mandated by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act (P.L. 106-169). Child welfare stakeholders collaborate to develop outcome measures for assessing state performance in independent living programs, track data on children receiving services, and collect information starting in the second fiscal year after the passage of P.L. The final rule establishing the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) became effective on April 28, 2008, requiring states to collect data on youth in FY2011. HHS uses NYTD for data collection and reporting activities on eligible youth. The final rule for the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) took effect on April 28, 2008, mandating states to collect data on youth starting in FY2011. States report information on eligible youth receiving independent living services, including their foster care status and outcomes. States are required to report data on eligible youth receiving independent living services twice a year, including their foster care status and outcomes. This includes tracking youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive services. States have the option to track a sample of youth who participated in the program. States are mandated to report data on eligible youth receiving independent living services at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of service receipt. They can track a sample of youth to lessen the data collection burden and face financial penalties for non-compliance with data submission requirements."
