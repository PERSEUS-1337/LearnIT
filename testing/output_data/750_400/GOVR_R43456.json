    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly post-9/11 with new technologies like advanced X-ray systems and whole-body scanners. Policy changes include requiring passengers to remove laptops and liquids during screening, overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) created after 9/11 under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) oversees the screening process for airline passengers, requiring them to remove laptops and liquids. This is in accordance with the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) passed after the 9/11 attacks. ATSA mandated comprehensive security screening for all airline passengers and property, while also allowing TSA to implement trusted traveler programs and utilize technology to expedite screening for participants. The Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) mandated comprehensive security screening for all airline passengers and property. Congress also directed TSA to check all passengers against terrorist watchlists. Trusted traveler programs and technology were implemented to expedite screening for certain passengers. TSA was directed by Congress to check all airline passengers against terrorist watchlists. Despite challenges, TSA has mainly relied on a uniform risk assumption for airport checkpoint screening, unlike its risk-based strategies for other aviation security aspects. Passenger screening challenges have led TSA to rely on a uniform risk assumption for airport checkpoint screening, unlike its risk-based strategies for other aviation security aspects. Efforts to improve screening have focused on technology like whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment for better threat detection. The focus on improving airport screening has primarily been on technology such as whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment. However, constraints like budgetary considerations and limited resources for TSA personnel have hindered a solely technology-driven approach to screening, leading to challenges in maintaining security while avoiding long wait times. The TSA faces constraints in airport screening due to technology limitations, budgetary considerations, and limited resources. These constraints have led to challenges in maintaining security without causing long wait times for passengers. The TSA's capability to address long wait times at airports is constrained by space limitations and congressional restrictions on screener hiring. Passengers face cumbersome security procedures like removing shoes and separating laptops for screening, which can deter travelers. Inflexible security methods have led to public perception issues and criticism from experts like former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. The TSA's inflexible security methods have led to unpredictable airport wait times and criticism from experts like former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. Public perceptions of TSA have been tainted, with a 2012 poll showing only 54% of Americans thought TSA was doing a good job. TSA has attempted to shift its approach to focus on passengers thought to pose a higher risk. The TSA's security methods have been criticized for creating long airport wait times and a brittle security system. They are now shifting towards a risk-based screening approach, which has faced controversy and skepticism. The TSA is transitioning to a risk-based screening approach, focusing on passengers with elevated security risks. This shift has sparked controversy and skepticism due to differing views on risk assessment and mitigation. The dilemma of where to concentrate security efforts can be guided by Frederick the Great's advice to prioritize the main point and withstand some damage to avoid the worst blows. The dilemma of where to focus security efforts can be guided by Frederick the Great's advice to prioritize the main point and withstand some damage to avoid the worst blows, as echoed by former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. In a free society, perfect security is unattainable. The importance of prioritizing security efforts and accepting some damage to avoid greater harm is emphasized by Frederick the Great and echoed by former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. In a free society, perfect security is unattainable, but informed security measures can be implemented to minimize risks. Understanding the nature of security risks and identifying strategies to mitigate them is crucial in this process. While perfect security is unattainable, informed security measures can be configured to minimize risks by understanding the nature of security risks and identifying strategies to mitigate them. Risk in aviation security is often seen as a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. In aviation security, risk is defined as the probability of loss due to threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Specific probability values for threats and vulnerabilities are limited, so categorical techniques are used to quantify security risk. A comprehensive risk-based strategy aims to mitigate all elements of risk, including passenger screening. Risk-based aviation security strategies focus on mitigating threats, vulnerabilities, and security risks through passenger screening initiatives that detect and manage potential threats using detection technologies. Risk-based passenger screening focuses on detecting and managing threats by identifying individuals who may pose risks and using detection technologies to screen for threat objects. Vulnerabilities are addressed through multiple security layers, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals. Consequences are assessed in terms of potential severity. Consequences are primarily mitigated by emergency management and response activities, the responsibility of airports, airlines, and state and federal emergency management agencies. The responsibility for mitigating consequences and managing emergencies lies with airports, airlines, and emergency management agencies, not the TSA. Establishing effective risk-based strategies for aviation security involves defining the risk environment and determining acceptable risk levels. TSA uses risk scoring to assess and plan security strategies for air cargo. The TSA focuses on aviation security strategies by defining risk environments and acceptable levels. Risk scoring is extensively used for air cargo security, but not for commercial passenger aviation due to complexity and controversy. Passenger risk assessment is primarily categorical, assigning individuals to low-threat, unknown, or other categories. The TSA's aviation security strategy focuses on risk environments and acceptable levels. Risk scoring is used for air cargo security, but not for commercial passenger aviation due to complexity and controversy. Passenger risk assessment is primarily categorical, assigning individuals to low-threat, unknown, or other categories based on biographical data and behavioral indicators. The TSA categorizes passengers based on biographical data and behavioral indicators to assess their risk level. Behavioral-based risk scores are derived from indicators like ticket purchasing characteristics and behaviors exhibited at the airport. However, the validity of these methods has been questioned, and there may be disagreement on which specific risks a risk-based security strategy should address. The TSA uses behavioral indicators to categorize passengers and assess their risk level. However, the validity of these methods has been questioned. There is disagreement on which specific risks a risk-based security strategy should address. An example of this was the TSA's proposal in March 2013 to allow passengers to carry small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft, citing reduced threats and other security measures in place. The TSA allowed passengers to carry sports equipment onboard aircraft, citing reduced threats and other security measures in place. Critics argued that risks unrelated to hijacking and terrorism, such as unruly passengers wielding knives and golf clubs, were not adequately considered. The TSA considered allowing small knives, golf clubs, and baseball bats onboard aircraft but faced criticism from various groups. Legislation was introduced to prevent the TSA from lifting the ban, leading to the TSA deciding not to proceed with the proposal. This decision marked a shift towards risk-based passenger screening instead of the previous approach of prohibiting certain items. TSA considered allowing small knives and golf clubs on planes but faced criticism. Legislation prevented TSA from lifting the ban, leading to a shift towards risk-based passenger screening. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raised concerns about focusing on small items versus the big picture. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raise concerns about the focus on small prohibited items versus the bigger security picture, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on prohibited items lists and detection technology. They argue that this approach hinders the security system's ability to adapt to evolving threat landscapes, as demonstrated by the fact that the box cutters used in the 9/11 attacks were not initially prohibited. Israeli expert Raphael Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in aviation security, pointing out that they limit the system's ability to respond to changing threats. He highlights that the box cutters used in the 9/11 attacks were not prohibited at the time, emphasizing that detection technology gives terrorists a sense of what to expect. Ron argues that solely focusing on detecting threat items has never prevented a planned terrorist attack. Israeli expert Raphael Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in aviation security, emphasizing that detection technology gives terrorists a sense of what to expect. Ron argues that solely focusing on detecting threat items has never prevented a planned terrorist attack. This points to the need for integrating detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities, moving away from rigid screening practices. Advocates of risk-based security suggest integrating detection technologies with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities, departing from rigid screening practices. This approach requires proactive measures, emphasizing flexibility and unpredictability, similar to Israel's security methods. Advocates of risk-based security suggest proactive measures like Israel's security methods, which include demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers for heightened screening measures. Israel has successfully avoided major terrorist attacks for over 40 years using these methods. Israel's security methods involve demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers for heightened screening measures. Despite continued threats, Israel has avoided major terrorist attacks for over 40 years. The effectiveness of these methods in deterring attacks is uncertain, but adopting a similar approach in the United States is seen as legally and pragmatically problematic. Research by TSA's Kenneth Fletcher concluded that a risk-based approach to passenger screening tailored to meet the specific operational and legal framework of aviation security in the United States would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. A risk-based approach to passenger screening tailored to meet the specific operational and legal framework of aviation security in the United States is deemed more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. This approach is part of a comprehensive, multi-layered aviation security framework, closely interacting with physical screening checkpoint measures. Table 1 outlines key attributes of a risk-based aviation security framework, emphasizing its integration with physical screening measures. This approach allows TSA to focus resources on high-risk passengers and adapt security protocols based on perceived threats. Risk-based programs may influence the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Risk-based programs influence TSA's screening checkpoint measures to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers, allowing for the modification of security postures based on threats. These approaches have been in use since the 1970s, guiding decisions on the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Details on the interaction of these security components have not been publicly disclosed. The deployment of air marshals involves identifying high-risk passengers and flights, using risk-based approaches that have been in use since the 1970s. Before 100% screening of all passengers in 1973, the FAA used passenger profiles to determine screening criteria. Metal detectors and X-ray scanners became mandatory in the late 1970s at airports. Before 100% screening of all airline passengers in 1973, the FAA used rudimentary passenger profiles to determine screening criteria. In the late 1970s, metal detectors and X-ray scanners became mandatory at airports, leading to the abandonment of risk-based profiling techniques. However, FAA continued to utilize profiling tools to examine passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, concerns over aircraft bombings prompted airlines to ask all passengers basic security questions. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask all passengers basic security questions regarding carrying items and baggage control, as a response to concerns over aircraft bombings. The FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions about carrying items and baggage control in response to concerns over aircraft bombings. The questions aimed to target elevated-risk checked baggage and raise passenger awareness of security threats posed by potential bombers. The FAA required airlines to ask passengers security questions to raise awareness of potential threats posed by bombers. Despite criticism for being obvious and posed by untrained agents, the questions aimed to highlight security risks. TSA discontinued the use of these questions in 2006. Following the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed by FAA and airlines to identify potential security threats using flight reservation data. TSA took over CAPPS, which relies on algorithms to flag suspicious passengers. The Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system, developed in response to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, identifies potential security threats by analyzing flight reservation data. CAPPS, now overseen by TSA, uses algorithms to flag suspicious passengers based on indicators like purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, FAA and the FBI created a \"no-fly\" list of known terrorists to prevent boarding, but on the day of the 9/11 attacks, only 12 names were on the list. After the 9/11 attacks, ATSA directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for passengers, allowing screening personnel to identify potential security threats. After the 9/11 attacks, ATSA directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for passengers, allowing screening personnel to focus on potential security threats. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed TSA to ensure that all passengers are evaluated before boarding and to guarantee adequate screening measures. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed TSA to ensure that all passengers are evaluated before boarding, focusing on risk-based screening to address security threats. This was in response to the 9/11 attacks and aimed to establish a nationwide program for screening passengers and their baggage. The TSA was directed to implement risk-based screening for all passengers and their baggage following the 9/11 attacks. This included establishing a nationwide program for vetting passengers to expedite processing and focus security resources more effectively. The recommendations were made by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team. The TSA was directed to implement risk-based screening for all passengers and their baggage after 9/11. A nationwide program was recommended to vet passengers for expedited processing and effective security resource allocation. In response, TSA started developing CAPPS II, which aimed to include identity authentication, watch list checks, and enhanced risk assessments for passengers. CAPPS II was developed by TSA as a follow-on system to CAPPS, aiming to integrate identity authentication, watch list checks, and enhanced risk assessments for passengers. It was designed to categorize passengers based on threat assessments using various databases but was ultimately scrapped due to controversy over privacy and data protection concerns. The TSA developed CAPPS II to categorize passengers based on threat assessments using various databases, but controversy over privacy concerns led to its cancellation in 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for passenger screening against terrorist watchlists. The TSA scrapped CAPPS II in 2004 due to redress processes and focused on screening all passengers against terrorist watchlists. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for screening passengers against a larger set of government watchlists, urging TSA to conduct screening instead of air carriers. The 9/11 Commission recommended that TSA conduct passenger watchlist screening instead of air carriers, following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. TSA was required to utilize the Terrorist Screening Database and was prohibited from using algorithms for screening. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers, using the Terrorist Screening Database. TSA was not allowed to use algorithms or commercial data for risk assessment. In 2008, TSA introduced the \"Secure Flight\" program for domestic and international flights in 2009. The TSA implemented the \"Secure Flight\" program in 2009 for domestic flights and in 2010 for international flights, which screens passenger information against terrorist watchlists. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 records. The TSA's \"Secure Flight\" program, implemented in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, screens passenger information against terrorist watchlists. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities on the \"no fly\" or \"selectee\" lists. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) is a repository of foreign identities maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to include about 875,000 names, serving as a principal data source for foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB. The expansion of TIDE was due to increased reliance after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB, which contains over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, has expanded due to improved watchlist practices post the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. Intelligence community efforts have focused on processing nominations and removals for timeliness, accuracy, and completeness. The TSDB has expanded to over 500,000 identities since September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices post the 2009 bombing attempt. Secure Flight compares airline passenger data against watchlists to determine access through airport checkpoints. The intelligence community has focused on Secure Flight since the 2009 bombing attempt. It compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access through airport checkpoints, including additional screening measures and public health concerns. Secure Flight compares passenger names to watchlists for airport checkpoint access, including additional screening for certain travelers. Potential matches are retained for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. The TSA's Secure Flight program compares passenger names to watchlists for airport checkpoint access. Potential matches are retained for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Records not identified as potential matches are destroyed within seven days of travel completion. Known traveler lists and disqualified individuals lists are kept until updated. The program benefited from experience with the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Expedited screening due to past security incidents is retained until updated lists supersede them. Secure Flight development was informed by the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for international flights inbound to the United States. CBP cross-checks APIS data against various databases and terrorist watchlists for risk assessments. CBP uses APIS data from airlines for international flights to the US to conduct risk assessments on passengers and crew. They also utilize the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) to assess inbound travelers before arrival. ATS-P does not use a risk scoring methodology. The Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) is used by CBP to assess inbound international travelers before arrival by comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential threats. The system does not use a risk scoring methodology but looks for red flags such as suspected use of lost or stolen passports. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) does not use risk scoring to determine individual risk. It compares passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential threats and red flags like lost or stolen passports. Data in ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, but passenger name record data is depersonalized within six months and can be retained for up to five years. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) uses risk scoring for cargo screening, while passenger data is compared against databases for potential threats like lost or stolen passports. Data in ATS can be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months and stored for up to five years. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization before boarding U.S.-bound flights. Passenger data is stored in an active database for up to five years before being transferred to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization before boarding U.S.-bound flights, which is checked against various law enforcement databases for potential threats. CBP transmits status codes to Secure Flight indicating any potential threats based on database checks. Secure Flight utilizes risk-based analysis for security measures. The TSA program, Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT), aims to identify potential threats by observing passenger behavior at airports. The program deployed almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program uses risk-based analysis with data from government agencies and airlines to identify potential threats by observing passenger behavior at airports. The program, which began testing in 2003, deployed almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012, costing about $200 million annually. Concerns over program costs, scientific validity, and operational utility have fueled controversy since its inception. The TSA's SPOT program deploys almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports, costing about $200 million annually. Concerns over program costs, scientific validity, and operational utility have fueled controversy since its inception. TSA asserts that SPOT is based on scientifically validated behaviors to identify potential threats. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes behavior detection techniques rooted in law enforcement methods to identify potential threats in the transportation network. SPOT differs from traditional law enforcement behavior analysis tools by focusing on large groups rather than specific crimes. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats in the transportation network. Unlike traditional law enforcement methods, SPOT focuses on large groups of individuals and interprets non-verbal cues for threat detection. The TSA's SPOT program differs from traditional law enforcement methods by focusing on specific crimes and employing extensive interviewing methods to gather evidence for potential criminal proceedings. Unlike law enforcement, SPOT heavily relies on non-verbal cues for threat detection, using non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system based on behavioral indicators. The TSA's SPOT program is unique in its use of non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system based on behavioral indicators for threat detection. Unlike traditional law enforcement methods, SPOT focuses on specific crimes and can assess suspicion in less than 30 seconds. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes non-verbal behavioral indicators to quickly assess passengers, taking less than 30 seconds per observation. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office raised doubts about the program's ability to identify specific aviation threats. The SPOT program by TSA uses non-verbal behavioral indicators to assess passengers quickly, but doubts have been raised about its effectiveness in identifying aviation threats. The Government Accountability Office found that known terrorists had passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed, casting doubt on the program's ability to detect threats. The SPOT program by TSA, using non-verbal behavioral indicators, has raised doubts about its effectiveness in identifying aviation threats. In 2010, the Government Accountability Office reported that known terrorists passed through checkpoints with Behavior Detection Officers, questioning the program's ability to detect threats. TSA responded by conducting validation studies to improve detection techniques. TSA conducted validation studies with DHS and American Institutes for Research to improve behavior detection techniques. Tests showed techniques were nine times more effective than random selection. TSA addressed GAO recommendations for better assessment methods and program management. Study results have not been publicly released for independent analysis. The TSA conducted validation studies with DHS and American Institutes for Research to improve behavior detection techniques, which were found to be nine times more effective than random selection. Despite impressive results, doubts have been raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General about behavior detection. TSA has not publicly released the study for independent analysis. Despite partnering with international counterparts to refine the SPOT program, doubts about behavior detection techniques persist. GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General question the validity and utility of TSA's methods, citing concerns about the metrics used to evaluate the program. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General have raised doubts about the behavior detection techniques used in the SPOT program by TSA. In 2013, GAO found that the evidence did not support the validity and utility of these techniques. Concerns were raised about the metrics used to evaluate the program, as they do not directly relate to TSA's mission of deterring, detecting, and preventing terrorism and criminal acts targeting aviation assets. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General have raised doubts about the behavior detection techniques used in the SPOT program by TSA. Referrals to law enforcement for various criminal activities do not directly relate to TSA's mission of deterring terrorism. Individual differences among BDOs in referrals raise questions about training and operational use of behavioral indicators. The effectiveness of the SPOT program in achieving its mission objectives is questioned due to low occurrence of terrorist acts and wide individual differences among BDOs in referrals to law enforcement. Metrics used to support SPOT's effectiveness are not directly related to aviation security objectives, with significant lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data presented. The DHS Office of Inspector General found that metrics supporting TSA's SPOT program's effectiveness are not directly related to aviation security objectives. Significant lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data were presented to TSA's senior leadership. TSA did not consistently offer formal refresher training for behavior detection officers, despite recommendations for constant skill honing and recurrent training. The Inspector General found that TSA did not consistently provide formal refresher training for behavior detection officers, raising questions about the quality and consistency of training. Despite being championed by TSA, questions remain about the efficacy of the SPOT program. Members of Congress have debated shutting down the program, but no action has been taken yet. The quality and consistency of BDO training, including performance evaluation and recurrent training, have raised questions. While TSA supports the SPOT program for passenger screening, doubts persist about its effectiveness. Despite concerns raised by GAO and the DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to address these issues. Despite concerns raised by GAO and the DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to shutter or revamp the behavioral detection program. While criticized, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting low-risk passenger processing, has received positive feedback since its full implementation in 2012. TSA's Pre-Check program, launched in 2011 and fully operational in 2012, has been well-received for expediting low-risk passenger processing. It is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and members of trusted traveler programs, with the option for others to apply for a fee at TSA enrollment centers. The Pre-Check program, launched in 2011, is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members. Others can apply for a fee at TSA enrollment centers. It is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The Pre-Check program, launched in 2011, is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members. Others can apply for a fee at TSA enrollment centers. It bears resemblance to the former Registered Traveler program, which was scrapped in 2009 under a public-private partnership model. The Registered Traveler program, launched in 2007, allowed expedited screening for travelers at multiple airports. Initially, extensive background checks were conducted, but these were later eliminated in 2008 as they were deemed unnecessary due to terrorist watchlist checks. TSA initially conducted extensive background checks for the Registered Traveler program in 2007 but eliminated them in 2008, deeming them unnecessary as terrorist watchlist checks were sufficient. However, under the Pre-Check program, TSA has reintroduced biographic-based background checks, indicating a reversal of their previous stance. Unlike Registered Traveler, Pre-Check does not issue a biometric credential. Under the Pre-Check program, TSA has reintroduced extensive biographic-based background checks, issuing a known traveler number for expedited screening without a biometric credential. Participants may still be randomly selected for screening. The Pre-Check program issues a known traveler number for expedited screening without a biometric credential. Participants may be randomly selected for more thorough screening to prevent exploitation of the system. TSA's ability to authenticate boarding passes and traveler documents is limited. TSA's ability to authenticate boarding passes for Pre-Check participants is limited, raising concerns about access to screening lanes. Deployment of authentication technologies faces delays and challenges, potentially compromising security measures. The deployment of authentication technologies for Credential Authentication Technology/Boarding Pass Scanning Systems is delayed and facing technical and managerial challenges. Without proper authentication, TSA may not be able to ensure access to Pre-Check screening lanes is restricted to cleared individuals. TSA issued a system of records notice in September 2013 for the Pre-Check program, outlining the process for applicants to voluntarily apply and submit biographic and biometric data. In September 2013, TSA issued a system of records notice (SORN) for the Pre-Check program, detailing the process for applicants to submit biographic and biometric data for security threat assessments. This includes fingerprints and identity verification documentation like passports or driver's licenses. TSA uses law enforcement, immigration, and intelligence databases, including FBI criminal history records checks. TSA collects biometric data such as fingerprints and identity verification documents for security threat assessments. This information is used to conduct background checks through law enforcement, immigration, and intelligence databases, including FBI criminal history records. Pre-Check applications are accepted from U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents, with eligibility criteria based on criminal history within specific time periods. TSA conducts background checks through FBI criminal history records for Pre-Check applications. Eligibility criteria include specific time periods for criminal history, with disqualifications for certain crimes and extensive foreign or domestic convictions. Applicants may also be rejected based on government watchlists and Interpol data. TSA conducts background checks for Pre-Check applicants, including FBI criminal history records. Eligibility criteria involve specific time periods for criminal history and disqualifications for certain crimes. Applicants may also be rejected based on government watchlists and Interpol data. Approved applicants receive a Pre-Check Known Traveler Number valid for five years after paying a $85 processing fee. Rejected applicants must notify TSA within 30 days. Applicants for TSA Pre-Check must pay a $85 processing fee and undergo background checks, including FBI criminal history records. Once approved, travelers receive a Pre-Check Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Rejected applicants can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records for corrections. The processing fee is non-refundable. To appeal a rejection for TSA Pre-Check, applicants must notify TSA within 30 days and provide certified records to support their claim. The $85 processing fee is non-refundable, so individuals unsure of their eligibility may choose not to apply. The first Pre-Check enrollment center for the public opened in Indianapolis in December 2013. TSA expects more centers to open in the future. Individuals who may be disqualified due to their criminal record or other factors like citizenship can opt not to apply for TSA Pre-Check. The first enrollment center opened in Indianapolis in December 2013, with plans for 300 nationwide centers and an online application process. Applicants can start online but must visit a center for identification and fingerprinting. Frequent travelers have shown satisfaction with the program. TSA plans to have 300 enrollment centers nationwide and an online application process for Pre-Check. Applicants can start online but need to visit a center for identification and fingerprints. Early feedback shows high satisfaction among frequent travelers, with 54% very satisfied compared to 7% for regular TSA screening. However, rapid expansion may limit program benefits. The Pre-Check program has received positive feedback from frequent travelers, with almost 54% very satisfied or extremely satisfied compared to less than 7% for regular TSA screening. However, the rapid expansion of the program to over 100 airports may lead to increased wait times in Pre-Check lanes as it aims to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by the close of FY2015. The TSA has expanded Pre-Check's expedited screening lanes to over 100 airports, aiming to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. As the program grows, wait times in Pre-Check lanes may increase, but non-participating travelers could benefit from shorter lines as more travelers join. Non-participating travelers may also be selected for Pre-Check lanes through Secure Flight assessments or managed inclusion. Non-participating travelers may save time as more join Pre-Check. They could be selected for expedited screening through Secure Flight assessments or managed inclusion, which identifies low-risk individuals for random selection. TSA is using new passenger screening canine teams to detect explosives in crowded areas. Managed inclusion is a TSA initiative that involves real-time threat assessments of passengers to identify low-risk individuals eligible for random selection for Pre-Check screening. Canine teams and behavioral detection officers perform initial screening, and if no elevated risk is detected, passengers may be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening. Passengers in the screening checkpoint queue may be randomly selected for managed inclusion in a Pre-Check screening lane based on canine team and officer assessments. A lighted directional arrow at the travel document checker's kiosk guides them to either regular or expedited screening lanes. Passengers selected for managed inclusion in Pre-Check screening lanes trigger a directional arrow at the kiosk to guide them. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, as well as cleared military personnel for official and personal travel, are allowed to use Pre-Check lanes. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Cleared military personnel, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, can use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Family members over 12 must either use standard screening lanes or independently qualify for Pre-Check. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard may also participate in expedited screening. Family members over age 12 must either use standard screening lanes or qualify for the Pre-Check program. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard can also participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are used for airline crewmembers as well. Beginning in mid-April 2014, airline crewmembers, including pilots and flight attendants, can participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check or a CBP trusted traveler program. Airline-issued identification credentials are checked against a database of participating airlines' crew personnel with valid security background checks for eligibility. Crew members undergo TSA-managed fingerprint-based criminal history record checks and security threat assessments as a condition of employment. The Known Crew Member database verifies airline crew credentials for expedited screening. TSA conducts background checks and security assessments for airline crews, equivalent to Pre-Check applicants. Military personnel and civilian employees with defense clearances also undergo thorough screening. The Known Crew Member database verifies airline crew credentials for expedited screening, with background checks equivalent to Pre-Check applicants. Military personnel and civilian employees with defense clearances undergo extensive screening, considered lower risk by TSA. The security clearance process for individuals holding defense secret clearances may be more extensive, despite recent criticism. TSA views these individuals as lower risk compared to the general population, and similar in risk to trusted travelers vetted by TSA or CBP. The credentialing process for military personnel, defense personnel, and airline crews is seen as a secure way to verify identity for expedited screening. TSA still uses random selection for screening. The credentialing process for military personnel, defense personnel, and airline crews is considered secure for expedited screening. TSA uses random selection for screening to maintain a comprehensive risk-based approach to security. TSA uses random selection for screening to maintain a comprehensive risk-based approach to security, collecting and retaining various forms of identifying data from individuals and intelligence sources. Each risk-based program has separate data collection and retention rules. TSA collects biographic, biometric, and identifying data on individuals, including information from intelligence sources and investigations on potential threats. Each risk-based program has specific data collection and retention rules, with a policy to delete unnecessary data. Records of individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are kept for longer periods, while others are destroyed after completion. TSA retains data based on risk levels, deleting unnecessary information.

Data must be protected according to the Privacy Act of 1974 and appeals procedures were established as required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Privacy Act of 1974 and other relevant laws require protection of data accessed by contractors. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 required the establishment of an Office of Appeals and Redress within DHS. The Privacy Act of 1974 and other laws mandate data protection for contractors. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires appeals procedures for security threat identifications in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 established an Office of Appeals and Redress within DHS for individuals wrongly identified as threats on commercial aircraft. The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address situations where individuals claim to have been wrongly identified as threats on commercial aircraft. This program allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail for redress. The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address situations where individuals claim to have been wrongly identified as threats on commercial aircraft. The program allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail for redress. Passengers can track the status of their inquiry using a control number provided by DHS. If a traveler was delayed due to a misidentification or name-matching issue, DHS will describe the steps required to resolve the issue. After completing the online questionnaire or complaint form, DHS requests supporting information within 30 days. Filers receive a control number to track their inquiry status online. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS outlines steps to resolve the issue, such as presenting a response letter during check-in. Passengers can appeal DHS decisions if they disagree. The traveler may need to retain a copy of the DHS response letter and present it during airline check-in. If there is a disagreement with DHS's decision, further steps can be taken to appeal. TSA's decisions under the Secure Flight program are generally not subject to judicial review. In 2013, TSA sought information to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers. In 2013, TSA sought to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers, aiming to assess the risk posed by individuals and communicate successful assessments to the Secure Flight program. The TSA sought to use non-governmental data elements to assess the risk posed by individuals in the aviation transportation system and communicate successful assessments to the Secure Flight program. Third parties could utilize legally available data services, with a focus on data accuracy and security. The announcement hinted at potential use of large commercial databases for gathering information on airline travelers. The TSA announced the potential use of large commercial databases to gather information on airline travelers, raising concerns about privacy and data accuracy for future passenger risk assessments. Commercial data services have historically been used for consumer credit risk assessment and targeted marketing. The TSA's potential use of commercial data services for passenger risk assessments has raised privacy concerns. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including CBP's ATS and other programs like Secure Flight and Pre-Check applications. The New York Times article in October 2013 raised concerns about passenger prescreening using non-federal government and private databases, including CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. Commercial data may play a role in risk assessments, raising privacy issues. The use of commercial data in risk assessments for passenger prescreening by TSA's Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, and Transportation Security Enforcement Records System has raised privacy concerns. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening for purposes other than counterterrorism. Congressional oversight and possible legislative action related to TSA systems utilizing commercial data for risk-based assessments may be of interest as TSA's approaches evolve. Congress may be interested in oversight and legislative action related to TSA's use of commercial data for risk-based assessments in passenger prescreening. This raises concerns about privacy and security, as details of TSA's programs cannot be publicly discussed. TSA's risk-based screening of airline passengers raises broader issues for Congress, including concerns about data security and privacy. Congressional oversight is crucial to review the effectiveness and efficiency of TSA's programs. Congressional oversight plays a crucial role in reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy. The risk-based programs developed by TSA are part of a comprehensive strategy to address security risks. Experts believe that risk-based screening should be integrated into a broader risk-based framework to effectively adapt to evolving threats. The risk-based approach to security, as presented in Table 1, should be able to adapt and evolve to address shifting threats and incorporate new capabilities. It is challenging to assess the adaptability of the risk-based approach in passenger screening, especially with new programs like Pre-Check and limited details on terrorist watchlists and behavioral assessments. The evolution of processes to consolidate and disseminate terrorist watchlist information has been a key issue for the intelligence community since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on December 25, 2009. Specific changes made in response have not been publicly acknowledged. The evolution of terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques is not publicly disclosed, including any changes made in response to security threats. TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices informing decisions have not been openly discussed in relation to shifting threat landscapes. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is difficult to assess due to the lack of publicly disclosed information on the evolution of behavioral detection methods and the selection of appropriate metrics. Congressional oversight may be interested in how TSA's risk-based strategy has adapted to changing threat landscapes, resource availability, and the introduction of new procedures and technologies. The selection of appropriate metrics for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is a key issue. Identifying suitable metrics is challenging due to the necessary secrecy surrounding security and limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs has been questioned. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is difficult to assess due to limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. Metrics for behavioral detection programs have been questioned, with concerns over false alarms singling out potential threats. TSA's focus on efficiency metrics for programs like Pre-Check raises security effectiveness questions. TSA's choice of metrics for programs like Pre-Check has raised concerns over security effectiveness. The limited number of terrorist encounters leads to frequent false alarms, potentially singling out innocent individuals as threats. Efforts to reduce false positives could compromise threat detection capabilities. Efforts to reduce false alarms in threat detection systems may lead to gaps in capabilities, potentially misdirecting limited screening resources and causing complications for innocent individuals mistakenly targeted as threats. Initiatives to minimize false alarms have focused on thorough information gathering from terrorist databases. Efforts to reduce false alarms in threat detection systems have focused on gathering thorough and up-to-date information from terrorist databases. A redress process has been implemented for individuals mistakenly targeted as threats, but the effectiveness of these measures in reducing false alarm rates has not been publicly disclosed. The TSA has implemented measures to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening, including a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of these steps has not been publicly disclosed. Risk-based screening initiatives are expected to result in cost savings of $120 million and staffing reductions of over 1,500 full-time equivalent positions. TSA anticipates $120 million in savings and 1,500 staff reductions through risk-based screening. Congressional oversight will examine security effectiveness and data protection practices. TSA expects $120 million in savings and 1,500 staff reductions through risk-based screening. Congressional oversight will focus on security effectiveness and data protection practices. The TSA is implementing a risk-based approach to passenger screening to save money and reduce staff. Congressional oversight will focus on security effectiveness and data protection practices. DHS has established practices to protect personal data, but questions remain about the implementation of privacy protections and data security measures. The TSA is implementing a risk-based approach to passenger screening to save money and reduce staff. Questions persist about whether this approach integrates various programs effectively, adapts to changes in the threat landscape, and identifies appropriate metrics for assessing program effectiveness. The TSA is implementing a risk-based approach to passenger screening to save money and reduce staff. This includes changes in resources, new procedures, and technologies to detect and mitigate threats to civil aviation while balancing security and privacy concerns. Despite post-9/11 security measures, there is still potential for threats. Despite extensive security measures post-9/11, the potential for large-scale aviation attacks remains. The debate over balancing privacy with effective security strategies to combat terrorism will continue to be a key issue in aviation security policy and potential congressional oversight."
