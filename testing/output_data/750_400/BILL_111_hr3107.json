The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objectives of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's regular budget. The IAEA's Technical Cooperation Program, funded by voluntary contributions, provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. The United States is the largest contributor to this program. The Technical Cooperation Program, funded by member states through the Technical Cooperation Fund, provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. The United States is the largest financial contributor to this program. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that assistance is not systematically limited to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. The Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. These countries also received over $4.4 million in assistance in 2008. The GAO report revealed that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received more than $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. In 2008, these countries received over $4.4 million in assistance. The GAO report highlighted proliferation concerns regarding the Technical Cooperation Program due to its assistance to certain countries with dual-use nuclear technology, including Iran's projects related to the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program's contribution to nuclear weapons development, specifically mentioning Iran's projects related to the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The report also highlighted difficulties in identifying and resolving proliferation concerns due to a lack of formal mechanisms for obtaining project information. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program's difficulties in identifying and resolving proliferation concerns due to a lack of formal mechanisms for obtaining project information.

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization, as well as programs and projects of the IAEA in Cuba. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 restricted funds for IAEA programs in Cuba, including projects at the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 required the US to withhold funding to the IAEA for projects in Cuba related to the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. The GAO report suggested withholding future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund proportionate to funding for state sponsors of terrorism and other concerning countries. The State Department plans to withhold future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund based on funding for state sponsors of terrorism and other concerning countries. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions regarding heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. The IAEA has repeatedly reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions on heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. The IAEA reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions on heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737 (2006) restricted technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes only. The IAEA Director General stated in 2009 that Iran has around 7,000 nuclear activities. The IAEA Director General reported in 2009 that Iran has approximately 7,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, enough for further enrichment into high-enriched uranium for a potential atomic bomb. Iran has around 5,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, considered enough for producing high-enriched uranium for a potential atomic bomb. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA Director General has repeatedly reported concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, including Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol. The IAEA Director General has reported that Iran has not implemented the Additional Protocol, which is necessary for credible assurance about undeclared nuclear activities. Iran has also not agreed to provide access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing, uranium enrichment research, and mining and milling, as requested by the Security Council. The IAEA has requested Iran to provide access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing, uranium enrichment research, and mining and milling as a transparency measure. The IAEA Director General has reported a lack of cooperation from Iran regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. Iran has not cooperated with the IAEA regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, leading to no substantive progress on the issues. Iran has also refused to comply with multiple resolutions adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors. Iran has repeatedly refused to comply with IAEA resolutions regarding its nuclear program, blocking inspections and denying access to its enrichment site at Natanz. Iran continues to block IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, denying access to the enrichment site at Natanz and refusing to place additional surveillance cameras as requested. In April 2008, the United States revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was constructing a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour based on a North Korean model capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The reactor was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. Syria, with North Korea's assistance, was building a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The reactor was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. General Michael Hayden stated that the reactor could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour, destroyed in September 2007, could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor, and Syria has not provided requested documentation to support its declarations. The IAEA Director General reported to the IAEA Board of Governors in November 2008 that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour resembled an undeclared nuclear reactor. Syria has not provided requested documentation or agreed to visits to other locations. The IAEA Director General stated that Syria has not provided requested documentation or access to other locations, hindering the Agency's ability to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at a second site in Damascus. The IAEA has not been able to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour due to lack of information and access provided by Syria. Uranium particles of a type not declared by Syria were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus. The use of funds is prohibited. No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. The Secretary of State will withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA if a country is in breach of nuclear agreements, UN resolutions, or under investigation for noncompliance. The Secretary of State will withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA if a country is under investigation for breach of nuclear agreements or noncompliance with obligations.
