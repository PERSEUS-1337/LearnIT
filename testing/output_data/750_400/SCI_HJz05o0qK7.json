    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Assessing compositionality in these representations is important, but the machine learning literature lacks tools for measuring this. A procedure for evaluating compositionality by assessing the true representation-producing model is described. The machine learning literature lacks general-purpose tools for measuring compositional structure in vector-valued representation spaces. A procedure for evaluating compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with inferred primitives is described, exploring its relationship with learning dynamics, human judgments, and representational similarity. The true representation-producing model can be approximated by composing inferred representational primitives. This procedure characterizes compositional structure in various settings and explores its relationship with learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The representations in a communication game are illustrated in Figure 1, where an observation is encoded by a speaker model and consumed by a listener model for a downstream task. The space of inputs has a known compositional structure. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly in relation to compositionality. This is illustrated in a communication game where an observation is encoded by a speaker model and consumed by a listener model for a downstream task. The space of inputs has a known compositional structure that is reflected in the learned codes. The success of modern representation learning techniques has led to an interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, specifically in relation to compositionality. Many human-designed representation systems exhibit compositionality, which is the ability to represent complex concepts by combining simple parts. It is important to investigate whether and how compositionality emerges in learning problems. Representation systems often rely on compositionality, the ability to represent complex concepts by combining simple parts. While some machine learning approaches use human-designed compositional analyses, it is important to explore how compositionality emerges in learning problems without built-in structures. For example, a character-based encoding scheme learned for a communication task may raise questions about its compositional nature. Existing solutions for analyzing compositional structure in learning problems often rely on manual and subjective analysis of model outputs. This contrasts with machine learning approaches that use human-designed compositional analyses. The present work aims to provide a standard, formal, automatable, and quantitative technique for evaluating claims about compositional structure in learned representations.

This involves analyzing model outputs and developing automated procedures tailored to specific problem domains. The focus is on an oracle setting where the compositional structure of model inputs is known, aiming to determine if this structure is reflected in model outputs. The paper introduces a formal framework for evaluating compositional structure in learned representations, focusing on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known. They propose an evaluation metric called TRE to assess how well representations reflect the compositional analysis of inputs.

They introduce an evaluation metric called TRE to assess how well representations reflect the compositional analysis of inputs. The core idea is to optimize over primitive meaning representations to find a compositional model that approximates the true model. The proposal aims to optimize over primitive meaning representations to find a compositional model that approximates the true model as closely as possible. This involves searching for attribute vectors or value vectors that sum together to produce observed object representations, depending on the compositional structure.

It focuses on optimizing primitive meaning representations to approximate the true model by searching for attribute vectors and value vectors that sum together to produce observed object representations. The paper presents a survey of applications related to the compositionality of representations in learning processes. It aims to answer questions about how compositionality evolves, tracks human judgments, constrains distances between representations, and its role in generalization. The paper discusses the compositionality of representations in learning processes, addressing questions about human judgments, distances between representations, and generalization. It also explores the debate on whether distributed representations can model compositional phenomena. The discussion concludes with possible applications and generalizations of TRE-based analysis, exploring the debate on whether distributed representations can model compositional phenomena. Various approaches for compositional representation learning have been proposed since the 1980s-era connectionist-classicist debates. Since the 1980s, various approaches for compositional representation learning have been proposed, with the main experimental question being how compositionality arises in models without explicit composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy evaluate the presence of compositional structure. The experimental question is when and how compositionality arises in models without explicit composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy evaluate the presence of compositional structure, but it is challenging to apply these techniques in more general settings. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of techniques for analyzing compositionality in general cases by deriving judgments from manual analyses of representation spaces. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of techniques for analyzing compositionality in general cases by deriving judgments from manual analyses of representation spaces, particularly those with non-string-valued representation spaces. Existing work lacks a suitable procedure for answering questions about compositionality in the general case. Some evaluations involve ad-hoc manual analyses of representation spaces, providing insight but are time-consuming and non-reproducible. Another evaluation method exploits task-specific structure to give evidence of compositionality. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model- and task-specific evaluations for measuring compositionality in representation spaces. Other authors base their analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and oracle similarity.

Our approach aims to validate surrogate measures of compositionality by examining how they track stricter notions of compositionality. We use an experiment from the natural language processing literature to validate our approach. The work in natural language processing focuses on learning composition functions to produce distributed representations of phrases and sentences for modeling purposes. This approach is complementary to the framework presented here, which is agnostic to the choice of composition function.

The current work demonstrates fitting existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning to representations from other models, even in non-linguistic settings, to measure the compositionality of the representation system. The speaker model observes a target object and sends a message to a listener model for a downstream task. The messages serve as representations of input objects, and the study aims to determine if these representations are compositional. The inputs can be identified through a composition of shape and color attributes. The research fits NLP techniques for compositional representation learning to measure the compositionality of the representation system. The speaker model's messages represent input objects, aiming to determine if these representations are compositional. An automated procedure is proposed to analyze the input structure reflected in the representations. The representation learning problem is defined by a dataset of observations, a space of representations, and a model mapping observations to representations. The automated procedure proposed analyzes the input structure reflected in representations. It assumes prior knowledge of the compositional structure of inputs labeled with tree-structured derivations.

It focuses on the representations produced by f and their use in a larger system to accomplish tasks. The technique focuses on tree-structured derivations and the compositional nature of representations computed by f. It defines compositionality in terms of a binary bracketing operation and a composition operation in the space of representations. The technique focuses on defining compositionality in terms of a binary bracketing operation and a composition operation in the space of representations. It requires a homomorphism from inputs to representations, where inputs are natural language strings and representations are logical representations of meaning. To show that a language fragment is compositional, a lexicon mapping words to their meanings is sufficient.

It requires a homomorphism from natural language strings to logical meaning representations. To demonstrate compositionality, a lexicon mapping words to meanings is sufficient. Algorithms for learning grammars and lexicons from data are essential for semantic parsing in language understanding tasks. Algorithms for learning grammars and lexicons from data are crucial for semantic parsing in language understanding tasks, mapping words to meanings and composing representations. However, challenges arise in identifying lexicon entries and handling languages with more general representation spaces. The definition of compositionality presents difficulties in identifying lexicon entries and handling languages with regular structures that do not fit the homomorphism condition. Oracle derivations guide the identification of primitive representations for words and suggest a process for composing them. The oracle derivations guide the identification of primitive representations for words and suggest a process for composing them to produce full representations. The speaker model is compositional as long as there is an assignment of representations to primitives that reproduces the speaker's input. The derivations suggest a process for composing primitives to produce full representations. The speaker model is compositional as long as there is an assignment of representations to primitives that reproduces the speaker's prediction. Predictions can be reproduced approximately by assigning meanings to primitives. The quality of the approximation measures the compositionality of the true predictor. The speaker model is compositional if there is an assignment of representations to primitives that reproduces predictions. Approximations can measure the compositionality of the true predictor. The quality of the approximation serves as a measure of compositionality. Predictors that are mostly compositional will be well-approximated on average, while arbitrary mappings will not. Compositionality can be measured by searching for representations that allow a compositional model to approximate the true function closely. Evaluation is done using Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) by choosing a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7. The evaluation procedure involves using Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to measure how well a compositional model approximates the true function f with parameters \u03b7. This includes computing datum-and dataset-level evaluation metrics to capture the constructability of representations from parts.

It also mentions computing evaluation metrics to capture the constructability of representations from parts. The text discusses optimizing over parts to evaluate compositional models using Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to measure model approximation of the true function f with parameters \u03b7. It also mentions defining composition functions with free parameters for learnable composition operators. The definition of TRE allows the evaluator to choose \u03b4 and * for learnable composition operators. Care must be taken when selecting * to avoid trivial solutions, especially when learning it. If D is injective, there is always a * that achieves TRE(X) = 0. When choosing a composition operator *, it is important to avoid trivial solutions, especially when learning it. If D is injective, there will always be a * that achieves TRE(X) = 0. This paper explores experiments with * in fixed and learned forms.

The paper also highlights ways of using TRE to answer questions about compositionality in machine learning problems. The relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics in deep models is studied using the information bottleneck theory of representation learning. It suggests that learning consists of error minimization followed by compression, where irrelevant information is discarded to isolate decision-relevant attributes. The compression phase in deep models involves finding a compositional representation of the input distribution by isolating decision-relevant attributes and discarding irrelevant information. This is done through a meta-learning framework where classifiers predict visual concepts based on two images. The model in a meta-learning framework predicts visual concepts based on two images, aiming to minimize logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. The model predicts visual concepts using example images and a test image, trained to minimize logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. Visual concepts are single attributes or conjunctions of attributes, with composition function as addition and distance measured by cosine similarity. The compositional structure of visual concepts in this task includes single attributes or conjunctions of attributes like background color, digit color, digit identity, and stroke type. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average over ten training runs using a training dataset of 9000 image triplets. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets with a validation set of 500 examples. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average over ten training runs. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. Both quantities are computed on the validation set, with small TRE indicative of high compositionality. The initial stages show low mutual information and reconstruction error. During training, the relationship between TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; X) is examined. Initially, both values are low, indicating little encoding of input distinctions. As training progresses, both values increase and then decrease together after mutual information peaks. This pattern holds across multiple training runs and during the compression phase. The curr_chunk discusses how reconstruction error and mutual information increase and decrease together during training, reaching a maximum before decreasing. This pattern supports the idea that compression in the information bottleneck framework leads to the discovery of compositional representations. The text also mentions the usefulness of high-dimensional embeddings in natural language processing tasks. The curr_chunk explores the compositional nature of individual phrase representations in high-dimensional embeddings for natural language processing tasks. The hypothesis is that bigrams with low reconstruction error are those with essential meanings. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Total Reconstruction Error (TRE) to determine the compositional nature of individual phrase representations in natural language processing applications. The analysis presented focuses on identifying bigrams that are essentially compositional versus non-compositional multi-word expressions. The analysis focuses on using Total Reconstruction Error (TRE) to distinguish between compositional and non-compositional bigrams in natural language processing. The goal is to validate this approach in a language processing context and demonstrate how it fits into the broader framework proposed in the paper.

The study compares bigram-level judgments of compositionality using vector addition and cosine distance with human judgments on noun-noun compounds. Results show that TRE(x) is anticorrelated with human judgments of compositionality, with collocations like application form and polo shirt rated as most compositional. The next section aims at providing a formal characterization of the relationship between TRE and another perspective on the analysis of representations with help from oracle derivations. BID7 introduce a notion of topographic similarity, arguing that a learned representation captures relevant domain structure if distances between learned representations are correlated with distances between their associated derivations. This can be viewed as providing a weak form of evidence for compositionality. In this section, BID7 introduces the concept of topographic similarity, suggesting that a learned representation is effective if distances between representations align with distances between their derivations. This provides weak evidence for compositionality, as edit distance is expected to correlate with derivational similarity. The goal is to clarify the relationship between these evaluations by defining a distance function for derivations. In this section, the relationship between edit distance and derivational similarity is explored by equipping derivations with a tree edit distance function. Proposition 1 states that an approximation to f with bounded tree edit distance can be estimated. The relationship between edit distance and derivational similarity is explored in Section 3 using a tree edit distance function. Proposition 1 states that an approximation to f with bounded tree edit distance can be estimated, with \u2206 serving as an approximate upper bound on \u03b4. The text discusses the relationship between edit distance and derivational similarity, showing that representations cannot be much farther apart than the derivations that produce them. Small tree edit distance is not enough for topographic similarity, but it does demonstrate that compositionality imposes constraints. In the final set of experiments, the relationship between compositionality and generalization is investigated through communication games. The focus is on how different derivations can be associated with the same representation, demonstrating that compositionality imposes constraints on similarity judgments between representations. The experiments investigate the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games, showing that compositionality constrains inferences from similarity judgments. The study evaluates the claim that agents require compositional communication protocols to generalize to unseen referents empirically by training numerous agents from random initial conditions.

A speaker model describes target objects to a listener model, who reconstructs them for rewards. The study focuses on training agents to communicate using compositional language structures to generalize to unfamiliar objects. A speaker model describes target objects to a listener model, who reconstructs them for rewards. The experiment involves training two policies, a speaker and a listener, in a reference game BID20. The speaker describes target objects with a message to the listener, who reconstructs the objects by predicting attribute sets. Both models receive rewards for correct predictions, with partial credit for partially correct ones. The policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective due to the discrete communication protocol. The experiment involves training a speaker and a listener in a reference game where the speaker describes target objects with a message, and the listener reconstructs the objects by predicting attribute sets. Both models receive rewards for correct predictions, with partial credit for partially correct ones. The policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective due to the discrete communication protocol. The target referents consist of two objects, each with two attributes, and the speaker and listener are implemented with RNNs. The experiment involves training a speaker and a listener in a reference game with a policy gradient objective. Each target referent consists of two objects with two attributes each. A subset of object pairs is held out during training for evaluation of generalization. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes, and the derivations have a more complicated structure. In a reference game experiment, a subset of object pairs is held out for generalization evaluation. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes, with more complex derivations where order matters. Agent messages are represented as sequences of one-hot vectors. The derivations in the current section have a complex semantics where order matters. A different class of composition and distance operations is needed, with agent messages represented as sequences of one-hot vectors. The composition function involves free composition parameters that redistribute tokens in the input string. The composition function involves free composition parameters that redistribute tokens in the input string, allowing for modeling non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages exhibit lower absolute performance, even in \"successful\" training runs where agents achieve a reward > 0.5 on held-out referents. The composition function involves redistributing tokens in the input string to model non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages have lower absolute performance, even in successful training runs where agents achieve a reward > 0.5 on held-out referents. The text discusses the use of gradient descent to compute TRE in multiagent training runs, allowing for arbitrary vectors in the elements of D0. The languages resulting from the training runs have different TRE but similar listener performance. The text discusses using gradient descent to compute TRE in multiagent training, allowing arbitrary vectors in D0. Different TRE but similar listener performance is observed in the trained speaker-listener pairs. Results from training 100 speaker-listener pairs show a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization. TRE is correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages often result from poor communication strategies. The relationship between TRE, generalization error, and absolute model reward indicates that \"compositional\" languages often stem from ineffective communication strategies. Low TRE does not guarantee good generalization, as trivial strategies can lead to poor performance. The fact that languages with low TRE often use trivial strategies resulting in poor performance, but low TRE is not necessary for good generalization. A new evaluation method called TRE helps identify languages with good generalization at different levels of compositionality. The TRE evaluation method helps identify languages with good generalization at different levels of compositionality by mining training runs for languages achieving high performance. The TRE evaluation method is used in representation learning problems to infer primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations. It has been applied to various problems related to compositionality and learning dynamics. One open question is how to generalize TRE when oracle derivations are not available. The TRE evaluation method is used in representation learning to infer primitive meaning representations. Questions remain about generalizing TRE without oracle derivations.
