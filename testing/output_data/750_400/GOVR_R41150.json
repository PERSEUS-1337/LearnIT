    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009. Appropriations totaled $33.5 billion in P.L. 111-85, with additional funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget for Energy and Water Development programs was $35.3 billion. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved a bill on July 15, 2010, to fund these programs. In FY2010, funds for Energy and Water Development programs were not fully expended. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget totaled $35.3 billion. The House and Senate approved bills for funding at $34.7 billion and $35.0 billion, respectively. The bill did not reach the floor for a vote. The Energy and Water Development programs were funded at $34.7 billion by the House and $35.0 billion by the Senate in FY2011. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government programs at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. The Senate and House passed a continuing resolution (H.R. 3081, P.L. 111-242) funding government programs at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. H.J.Res. 44 (P.L. 112-4) extended funding through March 18, 2011, with reduced funding levels for Energy and Water Development programs. H.R. 1 was introduced to continue funding for the rest of FY2011 at FY2010 levels, with specified exceptions for reduced funding. On March 2, P.L. 111-242 was amended to extend funding through March 18, 2011, with reduced funding levels for Energy and Water Development programs. H.R. 1 was introduced on February 14, 2011, to continue funding for the rest of FY2011 at FY2010 levels, with specified exceptions for reduced funding. The House passed H.R. 1 on February 19 with a funding level of $29.9 billion, while the Senate offered S.Amdt. 149 as a substitute with approximately $32.4 billion in Energy and Water Development funding. The Energy and Water Development funding level in H.R. 1 was $29.9 billion, passed by the House on February 19. The Senate rejected both H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149, leading to the introduction of H.R. 1473, which was signed into law on April 15, funding programs at approximately $32.2 billion. The Energy and Water Development funding bill, H.R. 1473, was signed into law on April 15, providing approximately $32.2 billion for various programs including civil works projects, the Central Utah Project, Department of Energy, and independent agencies. The Energy and Water Development funding bill, H.R. 1473, signed into law on April 15, allocated $32.2 billion for programs including civil works projects, Central Utah Project, Department of Energy, and independent agencies.

Tables 4 through 15 provide budget details for Title I (Corps of Engineers), Title II (Department of the Interior), Title III (Department of Energy), and Title IV (independent agencies) for FY2010-FY2011. Key issues involved in major programs are also discussed. Funding in H.R. 1, S.Amdt. 149, and P.L. 112-10 are included. The budget details for Title I (Corps of Engineers), Title II (Department of the Interior), Title III (Department of Energy), and Title IV (independent agencies) for FY2010-FY2011 are provided with key issues discussed. Funding levels in H.R. 1, S.Amdt. 149, and P.L. 112-10 are included in the overall tables. The Army Corps of Engineers' budget request is typically below its final appropriations, with the FY2011 President's request $564 million below the appropriated level. The FY2011 budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers was $564 million below the appropriated level for FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion for the Corps, an increase of $381 million over the Administration's request but slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers in FY2011, an increase of $381 million over the Administration's request but slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The House proposed $5.28 billion, while the Continuing Resolution allocated $5.05 billion, reducing funding by approximately $641 million from the FY2010 level. Development marked up the bill with $5.28 billion in funding for the Corps, which was reduced to $4.8 billion in the House-passed Continuing Resolution. The final Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million over the President's request but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program. About 85% of the appropriations for the Corps' civil works activities are directed to specific projects, which are often part of the debate over earmarks. Generally, appropriations are not provided to studies. The Corps' civil works appropriations, about 85%, are allocated to specific projects identified in the budget request or added during congressional deliberations. Funding debates often involve earmarks, with projects requiring prior authorization, typically in a Water Resources Development Act. Estimates of the backlog of authorized projects range from $11 billion to over $80 billion. Annual appropriations for the Corps' Civil Works program are not provided to projects that have not been previously authorized in a Water Resources Development Act. The backlog of authorized projects raises policy questions on prioritization and the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes. The Corps' Civil Works program has received significant funding through supplemental appropriations since Hurricane Katrina, totaling approximately $18.7 billion. This includes $15 billion for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. The backlog of authorized projects raises questions about prioritization and the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps' Civil Works program has received around $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations. This includes $15 billion for emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. Specific funding examples include $5.76 billion in FY2009 for Louisiana hurricane protection and $797 million in 2009 for flood control and coastal emergencies. The Corps' Civil Works program has received significant funding since Hurricane Katrina, including $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations. Specific examples include $5.76 billion in FY2009 for Louisiana hurricane protection and $797 million in 2009 for flood control and coastal emergencies. Additionally, the Corps received $4.6 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for construction projects. The Corps received $4.6 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for construction projects, including $439 million for barrier island restoration and ecosystem restoration for the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The FY2011 Obama Administration request included $1.69 billion for construction, a reduction of $341 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The FY2011 Obama Administration request included $1.69 billion for construction projects, with a reduction of $341 million from the previous year. The request limited new construction starts and included two new starts. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for the Construction account. The FY2011 request included two new construction starts, with the Senate Appropriations Committee proposing $1.9 billion for the Construction account. The committee suggested using unobligated balances from prior year appropriations to fund construction activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed using $120 million in unobligated balances from prior year appropriations for construction for the Continuing Authorities Program to fund FY2011 construction activities. The House subcommittee bill would have funded Construction at $1.851 billion, but P.L. 112-10 provided $1.78 billion for construction, slightly more than the amount requested by the Administration. The enacted bill also included a provision barring the Corps from using appropriations for new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) has a looming deficit. The House subcommittee bill funded construction at $1.851 billion, while P.L. 112-10 provided $1.78 billion, slightly more than requested. The bill included a provision barring the Corps from new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a deficit as expenses exceed incoming collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit as expenses have surpassed incoming collections. Current law dictates that federal funds cover construction and rehabilitation costs for inland waterways, with 50% coming from IWTF and 50% from the federal general revenue fund. IWTF is funded through a fuel tax on commercial vessels and investment interest. The IWTF is funded by a fuel tax on commercial vessels and federal funds, with 50% from IWTF and 50% from the federal general revenue fund. Additional federal funding was provided in FY2009 and FY2010 to address IWTF solvency issues. Previous proposals to increase IWTF revenues included replacing the fuel tax with a lock user fee, which has faced criticism from Congress. The FY2010 appropriations included federal funding to ensure IWTF solvency temporarily. Previous administrations proposed increasing revenues by replacing the fuel tax with a lock user fee, which Congress criticized. The FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting the user fee approach. The Administration's FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting the user fee approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with this temporary solution but warned that action may be necessary if a permanent solution is not reached soon. The Corps plays a significant role in coordinating the restoration of Central and Southern Florida. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach in its FY2011 report but agreed with budgeting only current year fuel tax revenues as a temporary solution. They emphasized the Corps' coordination role in restoring the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem and highlighted concerns about funding levels across federal agencies and the State of Florida for restoration progress. The FY2011 Obama Administration request for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work totals $180 million, funded through Department of the Interior appropriations bills. Concerns about funding levels for restoration progress are discussed in CRS Report RS22048. The FY2011 Obama Administration request for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work totals $180 million, with concerns about funding levels discussed in CRS Report RS22048. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill proposed reducing the funding to $155 million due to the Corps' inability to utilize the original amount requested for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill proposed reducing the funding for Everglades restoration to $155 million, citing a $25 million reduction needed for the Central and Southern Florida restoration element due to delays in project spending. The Administration has not proposed across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage since FY2006. Since FY2006, the Administration has not proposed across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage (S&S) within individual accounts. These reductions would account for anticipated spending delays on projects due to various reasons. Congress used to apply S&S rates for Corps accounts before FY2006 but stopped in FY2006 to decrease spending. Delays in project funding can be caused by weather, sponsor financing, or decisions not to proceed. Before FY2006, the Administration proposed S&S rates for Corps accounts, which Congress would adjust during appropriations. In FY2006, Congress stopped applying S&S rates to reduce the need for reallocating funds. The FY2011 budget request continued the practice of not including reductions for S&S, but the Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for specific accounts like Investigations (-$16 million) and Construction (-$88 million). The FY2011 budget request for the Corps did not include reductions for S&S rates, but the Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for specific accounts like Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account in FY2011, an increase from the previous year. The Bureau of Reclamation's FY2011 request totaled $1.064 billion. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account in FY2011, $1 million more than the amount appropriated for FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority, with a \"net\" discretionary authority of $1.015 billion after accounting for offsets. The FY2011 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion after offsets. An additional $167 million is estimated to be available for FY2011, bringing the total to $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, slightly less than the 2010 enacted bill of $1.129 billion. The FY2011 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion. An additional $167 million is estimated to be available for FY2011, bringing the total to $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion. The Senate bill, S. 3635, would have appropriated $1.133 billion for Title II programs; the House subcommittee's bill would have appropriated $1.108 billion. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $1.094 billion for these programs. Reclamation's largest account, Water and Related Resources, includes construction, operations, Dam Safety Program, Water and Energy Management Development, and Fish and Wildlife Management. Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a 4% reduction from FY2010. H.R. 1, the House-passed bill included $1.129 billion. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million, approximately 4%.

H.R. 1 proposed funding the Water and Related Resources Account at $911.6 million, $39 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The bill included amendments eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and barring funding for the implementation of biological opinions by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National. Section 4028 of H.R. 1 would have cut funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin tied to restoration efforts. Section 4075 would have prohibited funding for implementing biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and California State Project. It also barred funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. These provisions were not included in the final enacted version of the bill. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service regulations regarding the Central Valley Project and California State Project were not included in the final bill. The Bureau of Reclamation built most large dams and water diversion structures in the West for irrigation purposes. The Bureau of Reclamation built large dams and water diversion structures in the West for irrigation purposes. Today, they manage hundreds of dams and reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation is the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power provider. Reclamation manages numerous dams and projects in 17 western states, supplying water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but their operations can be controversial due to impacts on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The Bureau of Reclamation is the largest wholesale water supplier in the western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities provide flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but their operations can be controversial due to impacts on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The agency's budget is mainly composed of individual project funding, and it has been criticized for not exerting leadership in water supply provision or maintaining the West's existing water resources. The Bureau of Reclamation, a major water supplier in the western states, has been criticized for not taking a leadership role in water supply provision or maintaining existing water resources. The House Committee on Appropriations highlighted the need for active leadership in managing western water resources due to increasing demand and changing hydrology. The Central Valley Project in California is one of Reclamation's largest and most complex water projects. The House Committee on Appropriations emphasized the need for active leadership in managing western water resources, citing challenges such as balancing competing needs, increasing demand, and changing hydrology. The Central Valley Project in California, one of Reclamation's largest water projects, has faced limitations on water deliveries and pumping due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on project operations. In previous appropriations bills, amendments have been made to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on the effect of project operations on certain fish species, due to limitations on water deliveries and pumping from CVP facilities. In FY2010 appropriations, an amendment was proposed to prohibit restrictions on CVP and SWP operations due to BiOps that found continued project operation would endanger Delta Smelt and salmon species protected under the ESA and California ESA. OCAP, implemented in 2004, allowed increased pumping from the Delta, raising concerns about further imperiling these species. The 2004 Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) allowed increased pumping from the Delta, jeopardizing Delta Smelt and salmon species protected under the Endangered Species Act. Other factors like invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals have also contributed to fishery declines. Critically low numbers of Delta Smelt have led to limits on pumping, prompting a review of project operations and impacts on the economy and species. Low water deliveries to certain districts exacerbate unemployment in an already struggling farming area. The Delta Smelt led to pumping limits and a review of project impacts on the economy and species. Low water deliveries worsen unemployment in a struggling farming area. Proposed FY2010 amendments were not enacted, but a bill allowed water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The proposed FY2010 amendments preventing implementation of BiOps in the CVP were not enacted. The FY2010 enacted bill included an amendment allowing water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions.

DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license. The DOE FY2011 budget justification states that Yucca Mountain repository is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal, leading to no funding being requested for the project. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, which is currently being considered by the full NRC commission despite opposition from states with defense-related waste. The NRC licensing panel rejected DOE's motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on June 29, 2010, citing NWPA requirements. The full NRC commission is now reviewing the withdrawal, opposed by states with defense-related waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by DOE on March 1, 2010, will evaluate alternatives to Yucca Mountain with $5 million in funding from Congress. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by the DOE, is evaluating alternatives to Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal.

Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program with Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, established by Congress with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, provides loan guarantees for energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Subsidy costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount, must be paid up front by each project to cover estimated future government costs. The DOE's loan guarantee program, established in 2005, supports energy projects with new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Project owners must pay upfront subsidy costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with $47 billion in loan guarantee authority, with $18.5 billion allocated for nuclear power and $18.5 billion for energy efficiency. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested to increase the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion, tripling the previous amount. Federal loan guarantees are seen as a necessary step for energy projects with new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested to increase the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion, tripling the previous amount. The nuclear industry strongly advocated for this increase as federal loan guarantees are essential for financing new nuclear power plants. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced by the DOE on February 16, 2010, for a project at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. The DOE announced a preliminary nuclear loan guarantee on February 16, 2010, for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, totaling $8.33 billion for two reactors. The current $18.5 billion loan guarantee ceiling could cover about four reactors, while the proposed increase to $54.5 billion could finance around 13 reactors. The conditional guarantee agreement for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia would secure $8.33 billion in financing for two reactors, pending NRC approval. Critics argue that tripling nuclear loan guarantees to $54.5 billion would divert funds from cleaner energy technologies. The proposed increase to $54.5 billion for nuclear loan guarantees could cover about 13 reactors, depending on their size and cost percentage. Critics view this as a taxpayer bailout diverting funds from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects with a $6 billion appropriation to cover subsidy costs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects with a $6 billion appropriation to cover subsidy costs. However, $2 billion of that funding was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program, and $1.5 billion was rescinded for other purposes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $6 billion for renewable energy project loan guarantees, with $2 billion redirected to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion rescinded for other uses.

The FY2011 budget request includes funding for Material Recycle and Recovery, Construction, and Operations of Facilities. Institutional Site Support funding decreased significantly from FY2010 to FY2011 due to nonrecurring costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase in funds for RTBF. Institutional Site Support funding decreased from $120.1 million (FY2010) to $41.0 million (requested, FY2011) mainly due to nonrecurring costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing RTBF funds by $71.0 million to fill gaps at Pantex and Y-12 facilities, avoiding layoffs and disruptions to schedules. The committee also restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds by $71.0 million to fill gaps at Pantex and Y-12 facilities, avoiding layoffs and disruptions to schedules. They also restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a costly and controversial project to replace the over 50-year-old CMR building. It houses research on plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns about proceeding with the CMRR project as currently designed. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a costly project to replace the over 50-year-old CMR building. It houses research on plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. The House Appropriations Committee has concerns about the project's current design. The CMRR facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory lacks a clear mission unless there is a decision to pursue new nuclear warhead design and production. The Senate Appropriations Committee highlighted safety concerns and potential delays due to budget cuts. The CMRR facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory lacks worker safety and containment precautions, with spending cuts likely causing delays. The House Appropriations Committee stated that without critical decisions on the stockpile, it is impossible to determine the capacity required for the facility. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for the CMRR and Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility at Los Alamos due to uncertainty in stockpile decisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $125.0 million for CMRR to address previous funding shortfalls. NNSA justified the increase for CMRR in FY2011 based on capabilities needed. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for CMRR to address previous funding shortfalls and operational restrictions, despite arguments that Plutonium Facility 4 could fulfill some of CMRR's functions. The NNSA states that capabilities at the CMR are currently restricted, while others suggest modifying Plutonium Facility 4 to fulfill some of CMRR's functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Weapons Activities, including Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear materials. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Weapons Activities, including Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear materials. This program also includes Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response to respond to and mitigate nuclear incidents worldwide.

Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and operational efficiency in nuclear security. The FY2010 appropriation for the Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program was $93.9 million, with a FY2011 request of $94.0 million. Site Stewardship, a new program for FY2010, had a request of $90.4 million but faced reductions in funding due to budget limitations. The House bill included $62.4 million while the Senate bill included $61.3 million and denied funding for the stewardship program. The FY2010 request for the new program aimed at enhancing efficiency in the nuclear security enterprise was $90.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee supported the program but reduced funding to $62.4 million due to budget constraints. The Senate bill allocated $61.3 million and denied funding for the stewardship planning initiative. The FY2010 appropriation ended up being $61.3 million. The FY2011 request was $105.5 million, with a recommendation from the Senate Appropriations Committee to reduce it by $5.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the FY2011 funding request for the Safeguards and Security program by $5.0 million, citing poorly defined mission priorities. The Defense Nuclear Security element saw a reduction of $38.8 million in the FY2011 request, attributed to efficiencies achieved through risk-informed staffing decisions. The FY2010 appropriation for Defense Nuclear Security was $769.0 million, with a FY2011 request of $720.0 million. The reduction of $38.8 million in the FY2011 request was due to efficiencies in staffing levels and procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for operations and maintenance, and $43.0 million for construction, a reduction of $9.0 million from the requested amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for Defense Nuclear Security operations and maintenance, with a $9.0 million reduction in construction funding to $43.0 million. This reduction was based on the project's dependency on the size of the CMRR nuclear facility. Cyber Security aims to implement IT and information management security safeguards across the NNSA enterprise.

The FY2010 appropriation for DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs was $122.5 million, increasing to $124.3 million in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. These programs support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and are part of the National Nuclear Security Administration, with funding reaching $2.137 billion in FY2010, up from $1.482 billion in FY2009. The National Nuclear Security Administration's nonproliferation and national security programs received $2.137 billion in FY2010, up from $1.482 billion in FY2009. The increase was mainly due to returning major construction projects to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. The Obama Administration requested a further increase for FY2011. The Obama Administration requested a further increase for FY2011 for the National Nuclear Security Administration's nonproliferation and national security programs, including the Fissile Materials Disposition program and the Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program. The FY2011 request for these programs was $351.6 million and $155.9 million, respectively. The R&D program was funded at $317.3 million for FY2010 and requested $351.6 million for FY2011. Nonproliferation and International Security programs, including international safeguards and export controls, had a FY2011 request of $155.9 million. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) received $572.1 million in FY2010 and requested $590.1 million for FY2011. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production aims to persuade Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. The MPC&A program, funded at $572.1 million in FY2010 and requested $590.1 million for FY2011, aims to reduce the threat of unsecured Russian weapons and materials. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program persuades Russia to shut down reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium, with two reactors already closed in 2008. The third reactor, set to close in December 2010, will be replaced by a fossil-fueled facility. The program was funded at $24.5 million. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The program was funded at $24.5 million for FY2010, with no further funding requested for FY2011. The goal includes constructing a facility to convert the plutonium into \"mixed-oxide\" (MOX) reactor fuel at Savannah River, SC. The Fissile Materials Disposition program, funded at $24.5 million for FY2010, aims to convert U.S. surplus weapons plutonium into fuel for commercial power reactors. The program includes building a facility for converting plutonium into \"mixed-oxide\" (MOX) reactor fuel at Savannah River, SC. Funding for the program was controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium, but the Obama Administration secured $701.9 million for FY2010. The Obama Administration secured funding for the Fissile Materials Disposition program to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium. The program involves converting plutonium into MOX reactor fuel at Savannah River, SC, and relies on Russian fast reactors under nonproliferation restrictions. The FY2011 budget request was $1,030.7 million to continue construction. The FY2011 budget request was $1,030.7 million to continue construction of the Savannah River project and supply $100 million for research and development of a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia under the plutonium disposal agreement. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium. The FY2011 budget request was $1,030.7 million for the Savannah River project and $100 million for research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup efforts of former nuclear weapons production facilities. This includes disposing of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediating soil and groundwater contamination, and decommissioning excess buildings and facilities. The FY2011 budget request for this program was $558.8 million, an increase from the previous year's $333.5 million appropriation. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup efforts of former nuclear weapons production facilities, including disposing of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediating contamination, and decommissioning buildings. Cleanup actions are mostly complete at over 100 federal facilities across the US involved in nuclear production and research. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of federal civilian nuclear energy research laboratories and facilities involved in nuclear weapons production. Cleanup actions are mostly finished at over 100 facilities across the US, but larger and more complex sites with high-level radioactive waste will require ongoing cleanup for years or even decades. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still require cleanup. DOE expects ongoing cleanup at larger, complex facilities with high-level radioactive waste for years or decades. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still need cleanup, with estimated costs between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be required for operating, maintaining cleanup remedies, and monitoring contaminant levels. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that the remaining cleanup costs at 18 facilities could range between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operating, maintaining cleanup remedies, and monitoring contaminant levels over time, especially at sites with radioactive waste containment. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates remaining cleanup costs at 18 facilities could range between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Long-term activities to monitor contaminant levels are necessary for sites with permanent radioactive waste containment. Some facilities under the Office of Environmental Management have been transferred to other DOE offices and the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the Office of Environmental Management in 1997 to transfer responsibility for cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities. The Office of Environmental Management has transferred some facilities to other DOE offices and the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1997, Congress directed the Office to transfer cleanup responsibility for smaller, less contaminated facilities to the Corps, funded within their civil works budget. After cleanup, the Corps is responsible for activities for the first two years. The cleanup of FUSRAP sites is funded by the Corps within their civil works budget. After completion, the Corps is responsible for activities for the first two years before jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. DOE's Office of Legacy Management handles long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. The initial cleanup work at FUSRAP sites is completed, and jurisdiction is then transferred back to the DOE. The DOE's Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for these activities comes from three appropriations accounts: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The majority of funding for the Office of Environmental Management comes from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The Office of Environmental Management is funded by three appropriations accounts: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. In FY2011, a total of $5.69 billion was allocated for these accounts, which is a decrease from the previous year's funding. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $5.69 billion for the Office of Environmental Management, which is a decrease from the previous year's funding. The enacted amount is $358 million below the President's request and $319 million below the FY2010 appropriation. Additionally, $22.7 million was rescinded under P.L. 112-10. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $5.69 billion for the Office of Environmental Management, which is a decrease from the previous year's funding. The enacted amount is $358 million below the President's request and $319 million below the FY2010 appropriation. Additionally, $22.7 million was rescinded in unobligated balances for three accounts funding DOE's Office of Environmental Management. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $5.69 billion for the Office of Environmental Management, which is a decrease from the previous year's funding. $22.7 million was rescinded in unobligated balances for three accounts funding DOE's Office of Environmental Management, including funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup, Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, and Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup accounts. Cleanup concerns exist at DOE's nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. In FY2011, $900,000 was allocated from the Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account for DOE's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, including Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. These facilities pose complex cleanup challenges due to decades of nuclear weapons production, requiring significant funding from DOE's Office of Environmental Management. The Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory are three of the most challenging facilities for cleanup due to decades of nuclear weapons production. They require significant funding from DOE's Office of Environmental Management, with funding needs expected to continue for decades. Cleanup at Hanford may not be complete until 2062, at Savannah River Site until 2040, and at Idaho National Laboratory until 2044. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management is mainly allocated to Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory for cleanup, expected to last until 2062, 2040, and 2044 respectively. These facilities store high-level radioactive wastes in large volumes, with Hanford alone storing 54 million gallons. The lengthy horizons for cleanup at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory are due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites. These wastes are intended for permanent disposal in a geologic repository, but technical difficulties and the lack of a repository present challenges. The high-level radioactive wastes stored at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory are intended for permanent disposal in a geologic repository. However, technical difficulties and delays in waste treatment facilities pose environmental risks, with some tanks leaking into groundwater that discharges into the Columbia River. DOE monitors water quality in the river to assess potential impacts. Delays in waste treatment facility construction at Hanford have raised concerns about environmental risks from potential untreated waste releases. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes into groundwater that flows into the Columbia River. The Department of Energy (DOE) monitors water quality in the river to ensure contaminants are within acceptable levels. There is also interest in funding sources for cleaning up three uranium enrichment facilities managed by the Office of Environmental Management. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to fund the cleanup of three uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. The fund also reimburses licensees for their cleanup costs. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, finances the cleanup of three facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. It collects special assessments from nuclear utilities and reimburses licensees for cleanup costs. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, collects special assessments from nuclear utilities and reimburses licensees for cleanup costs at sites with enrichment facilities. Congress authorized payments from the federal government to the Fund, based on the premise that both the U.S. and nuclear utilities benefit from it. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund collects assessments from nuclear utilities and receives federal payments for cleanup costs at enrichment facilities. The authority to collect utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued federal payments since then. States and nuclear utilities should share liability for cleanup of facilities involved in enriched uranium production. Congress has continued federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund through annual appropriations, as the fund balance may not cover cleanup costs. Congress has maintained federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund through annual appropriations, as the fund balance may not be enough to cover future cleanup costs. The Office of Management and Budget reported $4.5 billion available in the fund, significantly less than the estimated $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needed for all outstanding cleanup needs. The Office of Management and Budget reported $4.5 billion available in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for future cleanup, which falls short of the estimated $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needed. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments to increase resources, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and a total of $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in his FY2011 budget request to increase resources for cleanup, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and a total of $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Legislation is needed for the federal government to resume collection of the assessments, with bills introduced in the 111th Congress but not enacted. The federal government's authority to collect nuclear utility assessments from FY2011 through FY2020 is contingent on Congress passing reauthorizing legislation. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 2471 and S. 1061 were introduced but not enacted. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstating assessments in its report on S. 3635 due to the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President requested $730.5 million from the Fund for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstating assessments in its report on S. 3635, considering the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. For FY2011, the President requested $730.5 million from the Fund for cleanup, with $200 million in offsetting receipts assumed. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations from the Fund in FY2011, a $223.5 million decrease from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, lower than the President's request of $730.5 million. P.L. 112-10 allocated $507.0 million, a $223.5 million decrease from the request, with concerns about the lack of reauthorization for nuclear utility assessments to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, below the President's request. Legislation for reauthorization of nuclear utility assessments to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts was not enacted. The existing balance available for appropriation from the fund exceeded the request by billions of dollars. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund in FY2011, significantly lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The existing balance available for appropriation from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund substantially exceeded the request by billions of dollars. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund in FY2011, much lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The federal payment is made through a transfer of funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The federal payment for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is made through a transfer of funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The 1992 law requires DOE to pay cleanup costs even if the fund's balance is expended, potentially necessitating additional federal funds in the future. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorizes the federal contribution to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup costs. Additional federal funds may be needed in the future to ensure completion of cleanup at federal uranium enrichment facilities. Responsibility for long-term operation and maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management after cleanup. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorizes federal funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. Once cleaned up, responsibility for long-term maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, which also manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. Funding for this office is included in the Other Defense Activities Account. The Office of Legacy Management, funded through the Other Defense Activities Account, manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. In FY2011, $788.4 million was allocated for this account, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management. Funding needs for the office are expected to increase over time. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011, the same as the President requested but slightly less than the $189.8 million appropriation enacted for FY2010. Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to rise over time due to the cleanup and transfer of nuclear weapons production facilities. Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are expected to increase as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. The Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations sell power generated by dams for various purposes such as irrigation, flood control, and recreation. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams for various purposes such as irrigation, flood control, and recreation. Priority for PMA power is given to \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) prioritize selling power to \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives at the lowest possible rates. The PMAs cover expenses, repay debt, and manage federal investments in generating facilities. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for the PMAs was $118.5 million, a decrease of $4 million (4%) compared to previous funding. The PMAs sell power to preference customers at low rates, covering expenses and repaying debt. The FY2011 budget request was $118.5 million, a $4 million decrease from FY2010. Receipts were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses previously covered by appropriations. The FY2011 budget request decreased by $4 million (4%) compared to FY2010, reclassifying receipts from PMAs from mandatory to discretionary funding. SWPA and WAPA requested additional discretionary funding, while SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs. Falcon and Amistad operations requested $220,000, with $23 million in collections from Colorado River basins as an offset. In FY2011, SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with $23 million in collections from Colorado River basins as an offset. BPA is self-funded and receives no appropriations. River basins contribute to the net discretionary appropriation. BPA, a self-funded agency, receives no appropriations but funds activities through borrowing authority. The borrowing authority was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003 and further increased by $3.25 billion under ARRA, totaling $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding. The Bonneville Power Administration funds its activities through borrowing authority, which was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003 and further increased by $3.25 billion under ARRA, totaling $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding. The FY2011 budget proposed expenditures for operating expenses, Projects Funded in Advance, capital investments, and capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act, along with borrowing authority for planning, financing, or building new electric power transmission lines. The ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act. It also granted WAPA borrowing authority for planning, financing, or building new electric power transmission lines to facilitate renewable energy delivery. This borrowing authority was previously unavailable to WAPA but is now available on a permanent basis, with a limit of $3.25 billion. WAPA has established a new Transmission Infrastructure Program for this purpose. The Energy and Water Development bill grants borrowing authority to WAPA from the United States Treasury on a permanent basis, with a limit of $3.25 billion. WAPA has established a new Transmission Infrastructure Program for this purpose. Independent agencies funded by the bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, including $10.1 million for the inspector general's office, a decrease of $13.3 million from the previous year. NRC's major activities include safety regulation, licensing of commercial nuclear reactors, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The NRC budget in P.L. 112-10 is $1.052.3 billion, with $272.5 million allocated for new reactor activities, a $7.8 million increase. The NRC budget request for FY2011 is $1.053 billion, with $272.5 million allocated for new reactor activities, a $7.8 million increase from the previous year. This increase is mainly to handle new nuclear power plant license applications due to factors like volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NRC's FY2011 budget request is $1.053 billion, with $272.5 million allocated for new reactor activities, a $7.8 million increase from FY2010. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007, with more possible through 2011. Some license applicants have suspended work on their projects. NRC's proposed budget also includes $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear project. The Policy Act of 2005 led to the application for licenses for 30 reactors by electric utilities and generating companies since September 2007. However, some license applicants have halted work on their projects. The NRC's proposed FY2011 budget includes $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. This funding would cover costs related to adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and work towards an orderly closure of the agency. The Obama Administration wants to cancel the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project, leading to a motion to withdraw the license application. The NRC's funding request includes costs for adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and activities for an orderly closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support. The requested amount was included in P.L. 112-10. The NRC's FY2011 budget request includes funding for an orderly closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support activities, reactor safety inspections, license renewals, modifications, and homeland security spending increase. The NRC's FY2011 budget request includes funding for reactor safety inspections, license renewals, modifications, and homeland security spending increase. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for certain expenditures. The FY2011 budget request includes offsets resulting in a net appropriation decrease from FY2010.
