    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is made regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act introduces a biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture used by the taxpayer in a taxable year. The biodiesel mixture credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year is calculated by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate by the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture used. The biodiesel mixture rate varies depending on the blend, with rates of 0.01 cents for a B-1 blend, 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend, and 20.0 cents for a B-20 blend. The biodiesel mixture rate varies for different blends: 0.01 cents for a B-1 blend, 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend, and 20.0 cents for a B-20 blend. A B-1 blend contains at least 0.5 percent but less than 2.0 percent biodiesel. The biodiesel mixture rate for different blends is 0.01 cents for a B-1 blend, 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend, and 20.0 cents for a B-20 blend. The B-1 blend contains at least 0.5 percent but less than 2.0 percent biodiesel, while the B-2 blend contains at least 2.0 percent but less than 20 percent biodiesel. The terms 'B-2 blend' and 'B-20 blend' refer to biodiesel mixtures with at least 2.0 percent and 20 percent biodiesel, respectively. The 'applicable amount' for a B-1 blend is 1.5 cents. A qualified biodiesel mixture contains at least 20 percent biodiesel. The 'applicable amount' for a B-1 blend is calculated as 1.5 cents multiplied by the percentage of biodiesel in the blend divided by 1 percent. A qualified biodiesel mixture contains at least 20 percent biodiesel and the 'applicable amount' for a B-1 blend is calculated as 1.5 cents multiplied by the percentage of biodiesel in the blend divided by 1 percent. Qualified biodiesel mixture refers to a diesel and biodiesel blend sold or used by the taxpayer producing it. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel containing at least 20 percent biodiesel. It is sold or used by the taxpayer producing it as a fuel in their trade or business. Biodiesel used in the production of the mixture is taken into account for tax purposes. The credit for a qualified biodiesel mixture is only allowed if the sale or use is in the taxpayer's trade or business. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the credit. The credit for a qualified biodiesel mixture is only allowed if the sale or use is in the taxpayer's trade or business. No credit is allowed for casual off-farm production of a qualified biodiesel mixture. Coordination with exemption from excise tax is determined by the Secretary under regulations. The credit for a qualified biodiesel mixture is allowed only for on-farm production, not for casual off-farm production. The amount of the credit may be reduced to account for any benefits provided by other tax exemptions. The term 'biodiesel' is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils for use in diesel engines, including oils from various sources like corn, soybeans, and sunflower seeds. The term 'biodiesel' includes esters derived from vegetable oils like corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, cottonseeds, canola, crambe, rapeseeds, safflowers, flaxseeds, and mustard seeds. It must meet registration requirements set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. The biodiesel must meet EPA registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives under the Clean Air Act. If biodiesel is used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture and then separated, a tax may be imposed. If biodiesel is used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture and then separated or used in a different way, a tax may be imposed. A tax is imposed on a person who uses a biodiesel mixture other than as a fuel, based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons used. Applicable laws and penalties apply in this case. The tax imposed on using a biodiesel mixture other than as fuel is based on the mixture rate and gallons used. Applicable laws and penalties apply as if the tax were imposed under a different section. Rules similar to those for estates and trusts apply under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The tax on biodiesel mixtures is based on the rate and gallons used, with penalties applying as if imposed under a different section. Rules similar to those for estates and trusts apply under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Taxpayers may elect to have this section not apply for any taxable year. A taxpayer can elect to have the biodiesel fuels credit not apply for any taxable year by making the election before the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on the last date prescribed for filing the return. The election must be made in the manner prescribed by the Secretary. The biodiesel fuels credit election must be made before the deadline for filing the return, as determined by the Secretary. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit under section 38(b), with specific amendments made to include it. The biodiesel fuels credit is included as part of the general business credit under section 38(b), with specific amendments made to incorporate it. No carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit before January 1, 2003 is allowed.

The biodiesel fuels credit under section 40A is added to the tax code for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003. The amendments made by section 40A apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. The new subsection (f) under Section 4081 of the manufacturers tax on petroleum products relates to biodiesel mixtures. It allows for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures. The new subsection (f) under Section 4081 of the manufacturers tax on petroleum products allows for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures, based on the applicable biodiesel mixture rate. The reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is based on the biodiesel mixture rate, with the tax rate under subsection (a) reduced by a specific amount determined by the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is determined by the biodiesel mixture rate, with specific rules applying as defined in section 40A. The reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is determined by the biodiesel mixture rate, with specific rules applying as defined in section 40A. Definitions and certain rules from subsection (c) also apply for this purpose. Conforming amendments to section 4041 include regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the sale or use of qualified biodiesel mixtures. Conforming amendments to section 4041 and section 6427 involve regulations for the sale or use of qualified biodiesel mixtures, with reduced tax rates determined by the biodiesel mixture rate as defined in section 40A. The tax rates for qualified biodiesel mixtures are reduced by the applicable biodiesel mixture rate. Diesel fuel used in production is subject to specific tax rates under section 4081. Section 6427 is amended to include a new subsection (p) regarding biodiesel mixtures. If diesel fuel taxed under section 4081 is used to produce a qualified biodiesel mixture, the Secretary will pay the applicable biodiesel mixture rate to the person using the fuel. The amendments made by this section, effective January 1, 2002, state that if diesel fuel taxed under section 4081 is used to produce a qualified biodiesel mixture, the Secretary will pay the applicable biodiesel mixture rate to the person using the fuel. SEC. 4. HIGHWAY TRUST FUND HELD HARMLESS.
