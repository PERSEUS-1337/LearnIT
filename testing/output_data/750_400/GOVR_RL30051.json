    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. Action on 451 installations scheduled for closure and realignment by previous BRAC commissions was completed by FY2001. The legislation in 2005 extended and amended the 1990 base closure and realignment Act that expired after the 1995 round. Action on 451 installations scheduled for closure and realignment was completed by the end of FY2001. The BRAC closures and realignments have resulted in net savings of about $16.7 billion and annual recurring savings of about $6.6 billion. Additional base closures were deemed necessary due to the downward trend in defense spending and force structure. The 1995 round of BRAC closures and realignments resulted in net savings of $16.7 billion and annual recurring savings of $6.6 billion. In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds of closures in the Quadrennial Defense Review. In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen released the Quadrennial Defense Review, calling for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 due to the downsizing of force structure not keeping pace with base structure reductions. Force structure had decreased by 33% since the first closure round and was projected to decline by a total of 36% after the QDR reductions. The downsizing of DOD's base structure had fallen behind the downsizing of its force structure. Force structure decreased by 33% since the first base closure round and will have declined by a total of 36% after the QDR reductions. Domestic infrastructure was reduced by 21% during the same period. Closing more bases was necessary to achieve a proper balance between infrastructure and force structure and to secure significant savings for future funding. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to begin new rounds of base closures within the next five years was met with reluctance on Capitol Hill due to the need for significant savings to fund future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to start new rounds of base closures within the next five years faced opposition on Capitol Hill, with concerns about economic and political repercussions in districts. The House and Senate defense committees did not support new base closure legislation during mark-ups of the FY1998 DOD authorization bills. On June 12, 1997, the Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve the plan. Many Members on Capitol Hill expressed concern over potential economic and political fallout in their districts from new rounds of base closures. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve a proposal for two more rounds of base closing in 1999 and 2001. Senator Levin and other senators pledged to push for more base closings during the DOD authorization bill floor debate.

Representative Joel Hefley opposed new base closure rounds for at least five years, questioning DOD's savings estimates. Congressional Budget Office couldn't confirm DOD's claimed savings, raising concerns about rushing into closures without understanding military implications. The Congressional Budget Office couldn't confirm DOD's savings estimates in a December 1996 report. Congressional opponents objected to rushing into new base closure rounds without understanding the military implications of previous closures. Despite lack of support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President continued to push for new closures. Despite lack of support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President continued to press for new rounds of base closures in the near future. Secretary of Defense Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for more base closures to free up funds for priority weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included two additional rounds of base closures in 2001. Gen. John Shalikashvili and senior Pentagon officials announced the Defense Reform Initiative, which included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 to save $2.8 billion annually. This was part of a larger effort to increase savings through outsourcing and other measures.

This was part of a larger effort to increase savings through outsourcing and other measures, supported by a 1997 report. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 to save money. A 1997 report supported the effort to outsource and reduce personnel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The National Defense Panel urged for more base closures to start earlier than planned. The National Defense Panel recommended earlier base closures to accelerate the transformation of U.S. military capabilities, emphasizing the importance of additional BRAC rounds for financing. President Clinton's actions regarding the 1995 base closure commission were highly contentious. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of two additional BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. The 1995 base closure commission recommended closing two of the Air Force's major maintenance depots, justified by their low capacity utilization. The 1995 base closure commission recommended closing two Air Force maintenance depots at McClellan AFB and Kelly AFB due to low capacity utilization. President Clinton opposed the closures to prevent job losses in California and Texas. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly depots, directing privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas. Critics accused him of political meddling to gain favor in vote-rich states for his reelection bid. Opponents accused President Clinton of political meddling by directing privatization-in-place in California and Texas to prevent job losses, aiming to gain favor for his reelection bid. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the plan, believing it deprived their local populations of job opportunities created under the 1995 base closure commission's initial recommendation. Some legislators opposed President Clinton's privatization plan, fearing job losses and vulnerability to base closures. Resentment over Clinton's intervention persisted until the end of his second term, hindering support for new base closure rounds. Some Members opposed President Clinton's intervention in privatizing depot maintenance work, leading to resentment and hindering support for new base closure rounds. The House military readiness subcommittee approved an amendment to prohibit privatization at certain air force bases unless certified by the Secretary of Defense.

The imbalance between force and base structures was also noted. The Department of Defense report to Congress in April 1998 emphasized the need for new base closure legislation. Secretary of Defense Cohen highlighted the savings from closings for modernization and readiness, pointing out the imbalance between force and base structures. Examples included a significant drop in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to base reductions. The closure costs were detailed in the report as requested by Congress. The base closure report provided information on the planned reduction of Navy ships and Army soldiers, as well as the costs and savings from the closure of bases and facilities during BRAC's 1988-1995 rounds. The closure costs of the 1988 and 1993 rounds were less than the Pentagon's original estimate, with savings exceeding initial estimates. DOD expected net total savings of about $14 billion through 2001, with annual savings estimated at $5.6 billion. The two new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005 were expected to produce additional savings.

DOD's estimates of savings from previous closure rounds were $5.6 billion compared to $5 billion, with BRAC savings being avoided costs. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding estimates of savings consistent with their own. BRAC savings are avoided costs, not actual expenditures, making it challenging for DOD to measure them accurately. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, noting that DOD can only estimate savings as costs are avoided, not actual expenditures. CBO found that DOD provided a clear summary of potential savings from future base closure rounds but lacked analysis on data and insight into potential closures. Additionally, CBO highlighted the difficulty in analyzing the impact of base closures on local communities without specific community identification. The Congressional Budget Office found that the Department of Defense provided limited analysis and insight into potential base closures in future BRAC rounds. DOD was unable to locate some requested data, including original cost and savings estimates for the BRAC commissions. The accuracy of BRAC cost and savings estimates could be improved by including environmental and caretaker costs for bases after the six-year implementation period. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on BRAC closures, providing more detail than the CBO review. GAO gave DOD good grades, stating that most required information was provided. Previous BRAC closure rounds were deemed to result in substantial savings.

Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need to improve the base closing process due to bureaucratic obstacles. Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Congress to improve the base closing process to transition closed bases to private use more efficiently. He argued that failing to close more bases could cost the Pentagon $20 billion that could be better spent on upgrading weapon systems and enhancing the performance of U.S. forces. Cohen assured that politics would not influence future base closure rounds, but Congress did not authorize any new rounds. Congress did not authorize new rounds of base closures in 2000, despite Secretary of Defense Cohen's argument that failing to do so could cost the Pentagon $20 billion that could be better spent on upgrading weapon systems and enhancing U.S. forces.

Additionally, privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases was prohibited unless specifically recommended by the commission and determined to be the most cost-effective option. In May 1997, the Department of Defense announced the need for two further closure rounds in 1999 and 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure. Despite appeals by Secretary of Defense Cohen in 1998, 1999, and 2000, there was little enthusiasm from most Members of Congress. The decision to add a base must be supported by at least 7 commissioners, with the Secretary of Defense given the opportunity to testify on proposed changes. Privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases is prohibited unless recommended by the commission as the most cost-effective option. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld won approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005, despite initial reluctance. Concerns arise in communities near military bases about the survival of their installations. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld successfully obtained approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005. This decision has raised concerns in communities near military bases about the survival of their installations. Community leaders are implementing defensive and offensive strategies to retain their military units and functions, including potentially acquiring units from other parts of the country to ensure their base's survival in the next round. Community leaders near military bases are working to keep their installations viable by acquiring units from other areas. Concerns include \"range encroachment\" impacting base desirability to the Department of Defense or the BRAC commission. Range encroachment is a serious concern for communities near military bases as it can de-value installations and make them prime candidates for closure in 2005. Range encroachment near military bases can de-value installations, making them potential closure candidates in 2005. The 2005 BRAC timeline outlines the process for closure nominations and approval by the President and Congress."
