Domain names were created to simplify access to websites, with Top Level Domains indicating country codes or generic categories. The Domain Name System (DNS) simplifies access to websites by providing users with a simple location name instead of numbers. Top Level Domains (TLDs) indicate country codes or generic categories like .com or .org. Root servers coordinate to ensure connectivity across the Internet. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed set of databases containing address numbers mapped to domain names. Root servers coordinate to ensure Internet connectivity. The Internet originated from research funding by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for a military network, which later evolved into a civilian segment with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other science agencies. The Internet originated from research funding by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for a military network. A civilian segment evolved with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other science agencies. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) played a key role in making technical decisions concerning the DNS. Several entities, including the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), played key roles in managing the Internet and the DNS. IANA made technical decisions regarding root servers, assigned unique protocol parameters, and managed the IP address space. NSF was responsible for registering nonmilitary domain names. The National Science Foundation (NSF) made technical decisions concerning root servers, managed the IP address space, and delegated blocks of addresses to registries worldwide. In 1992, NSF solicited for managing network services, leading to a five-year agreement with InterNic, where Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) became the sole Internet domain name registrar. In 1992, NSF solicited for managing network services and signed a five-year agreement with InterNic, where NSI became the sole Internet domain name registrar for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Criticism grew over NSI's control and trademark disputes in the .com domain. After becoming the sole registrar for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs, NSI faced criticism for its control and trademark disputes in the .com domain. Concerns about IANA's legal foundation and the stability of the Internet led to actions both in the US and internationally, including a proposal by the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC). The International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing more registrars to compete in granting registration services for new second level domain names, prompting actions in the US and internationally to address concerns about IANA's legal foundation and Internet stability. The IAHC proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing more registrars to compete in granting registration services for new second level domain names. The U.S. government created an interagency group led by the NTIA to address the domain name issue and issued a final policy statement on the management of Internet names and addresses in June 1998. The U.S. government supported a proposal to address the domain name issue by creating an interagency group led by the NTIA. In June 1998, the DOC issued a final policy statement called the White Paper, indicating readiness to recognize a new not-for-profit corporation to administer Internet name and address policy. The U.S. government endorsed a White Paper proposing a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses, ensuring stability, competition, and fair representation of the Internet community. The U.S. government endorsed a White Paper proposing a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses, ensuring stability, competition, and fair representation of the Internet community. Internet constituencies worldwide held meetings to discuss the formation of the New Corporation, with IANA and NSI collaborating on proposed bylaws and incorporation articles. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was proposed and finalized in collaboration between IANA and NSI. The final version of ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998, and an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN on November 25, 1998. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was established and finalized in collaboration between IANA and NSI. The final version of ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. An official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN on November 25, 1998, outlining the transition of management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. The MOU was later extended until September 30, 2006. On June 30, 2005, Michael Gallagher, then-Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and Administrator of NTIA, stated the U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing the intention to preserve the security and stability of the DNS. The MOU outlined transition tasks for ICANN. NTIA affirmed the U.S. government's commitment to DNS security and stability, authorizing root zone changes, recognizing governments' interests in country code domains, endorsing ICANN as DNS manager, and advocating ongoing Internet governance dialogue. The United States authorized changes to the root zone to preserve DNS security and stability. Governments have legitimate interests in managing their country code domains. ICANN is recognized as the appropriate technical manager of the DNS. A new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms. On September 29, 2006, DOC announced a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to transition the coordination of technical functions related to DNS management to the private sector. The JPA extended through September 30, 2009, focusing on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, DOC and ICANN agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) to institutionalize global technical coordination of the DNS by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, and security. ICANN and the Department of Commerce (DOC) agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) in 2009 to ensure accountability, transparency, and security in the global technical coordination of the DNS. The AoC also aims to promote competition, consumer trust, choice, and international participation. ICANN is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law.

The organization's budget has grown significantly due to the expansion of the Internet and domain name registration. The ICANN Board consists of 16 international members, including a president and representatives from various supporting organizations. The explosive growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to a significant increase in the ICANN budget, reaching $159 million in revenue and a staff of 373 in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. ICANN's budget has grown significantly from $6 million and 14 staff in 2000 to $159 million in revenue and 373 staff in 2015. The organization is funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators like GoDaddy, Google, and VeriSign. Registry operators, such as VeriSign, Inc., Public Interest Registry, and Neustar, Inc., manage the master database of domain names in top-level domains. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. Other committees, like the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, are interested in issues like intellectual property and privacy affected by ICANN. The Department of Commerce and congressional committees oversee ICANN's activities and policies. Other committees are interested in issues like intellectual property and privacy affected by ICANN. The U.S. government originally owned and operated the Internet infrastructure. The Department of Commerce and congressional committees oversee ICANN's activities. The U.S. government originally owned and operated the Internet infrastructure, but has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a transition process for technical DNS. ICANN, originally operated by private contractors, oversees network architecture for the domain name system. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated the transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The Department of Commerce retains a role in DNS via contractual agreements. The Department of Commerce oversees the transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN was signed on September 30, 2009 to institutionalize the technical coordination of the DNS globally. It succeeded the Joint Project Agreement and aimed to be led by a private-sector organization. The DOC and VeriSign manage the official DNS root zone file. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN was signed on September 30, 2009 to institutionalize the technical coordination of the DNS globally. The AoC has no expiration date and would conclude only if one of the two parties decided to terminate the agreement. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN, signed on September 30, 2009, has no expiration date and would only end if one party decides to terminate it. There were disagreements among Internet stakeholders on whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN after the JPA expiration. U.S. industry and public interest groups argued for continued DOC oversight to prevent undue control of the DNS by foreign entities until full privatization. In 2009, there were debates over the need for continued U.S. government oversight of ICANN. U.S. industry groups wanted to prevent foreign control of the DNS, while international entities believed ICANN was ready for privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress regarding this issue. In 2009, debates arose over U.S. government oversight of ICANN. U.S. industry groups opposed foreign control, while international entities supported privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress on this issue.

Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in response to concerns about ICANN's progress in achieving accountability and transparency goals outlined in the JPA. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public input on the JPA expiration, highlighting areas where further work was needed to increase confidence in ICANN. The NTIA conducted a mid-term review on ICANN's progress, identifying key areas for improvement such as long-term stability, accountability, and stakeholder participation. Public comments were requested on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and ICANN's model of private-sector leadership. The NTIA requested public comments on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and ICANN's model of private-sector leadership. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on the expiration of the JPA and related issues. On June 4, 2009, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed extending the JPA or a similar agreement between DOC and ICANN. Majority members urged for a \"permanent instrument\" to ensure ICANN's perpetual operation. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce urged for a \"permanent instrument\" to ensure ICANN's perpetual operation, emphasizing the need for a long-term agreement between DOC and ICANN to maintain accountability. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce called for a permanent instrument to ensure ICANN's ongoing accountability and operation. This instrument should maintain the current DOC-ICANN relationship, include periodic performance reviews, outline steps for accountability improvement, address the addition of new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, ensure access to WHOIS information, and confirm ICANN's status as a not-for-profit corporation based in the United States. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce called for a permanent instrument to ensure ICANN's ongoing accountability and operation. This includes maintaining the current DOC-ICANN relationship, periodic performance reviews, accountability improvement steps, addition of new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, access to WHOIS information, and confirming ICANN's status as a not-for-profit corporation based in the United States. The AoC commits ICANN to remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices to serve the global community. Under the AoC, ICANN commits to remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices to serve the global community. The AoC calls for the establishment of review panels to evaluate ICANN governance, transparency, and accountability for the global Internet community. The AoC calls for the establishment of review panels to evaluate ICANN governance, transparency, and accountability for the global Internet community.

ATRT released recommendations for accountability and transparency improvements on December 31, 2010, which were adopted by the Board in June 2011. The ATRT made recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability regarding Board governance, GAC effectiveness, public input, policy development, and review mechanisms. The Board adopted all 27 recommendations in June 2011. A follow-up report, ATRT2, presented 12 new recommendations to the Board on December 31, 2013. NTIA emphasized the need for ICANN management and staff to swiftly implement these recommendations for meaningful reform. The ATRT recommendations were adopted by the Board in June 2011. NTIA urged ICANN to implement the recommendations swiftly for lasting reform. A follow-up report, ATRT2, provided 12 new recommendations to the Board in December 2013. The \"IANA functions contract\" allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions of the DNS. The \"IANA functions contract\" authorizes ICANN to manage critical technical functions of the DNS, including allocating IP addresses and editing the root zone file. Additionally, a cooperative agreement with VeriSign allows them to maintain the official root zone file on the Internet's root servers. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes made to it, such as adding a new top-level domain. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes, such as adding a new top-level domain, to preserve the security and stability of the DNS. The U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system aim to maintain the security and stability of the DNS. The expiration of the JPA and the establishment of the AoC did not directly impact U.S. government authority over the DNS root zone file. Foreign governmental bodies have argued against U.S. control over the DNS. The JPA was separate from the DOC agreements with ICANN and VeriSign. The expiration of the JPA and the establishment of the AoC did not affect U.S. government authority over the DNS root zone file. Foreign governments have argued against U.S. control over the DNS. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with an option to extend through September 2019. The U.S. government's exclusive authority over the DNS is questioned. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN with transparency and accountability measures. The IANA functions contract awarded to ICANN by NTIA includes a robust conflict of interest policy, respect for local laws, and transparency requirements. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems based in the United States, and subject to inspection by the U.S. government. The contractor for the IANA functions contract with ICANN must be a wholly U.S. owned and operated firm or a U.S. university or college, with all primary operations and systems remaining within the United States. The U.S. government reserves the right to inspect the premises, systems, and processes of all facilities and components used for the contract. NTIA has the authority to maintain a stewardship and oversight role over ICANN and the domain name system, but announced its intention to transition this role to the global Internet multistakeholder community. The NTIA has the authority to oversee ICANN and the domain name system. They announced their intention to transition this role to the global Internet community, asking ICANN to develop a proposal for the transition by September 30, 2015. NTIA plans to transition its oversight of ICANN to the global Internet community by September 30, 2015. They are asking ICANN to collaborate with key stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition. NTIA expects ICANN to collaborate with key stakeholders, including IETF, IAB, ISOC, RIRs, domain operators, Verisign, and global stakeholders for the transition of oversight by September 30, 2015. In October 2013, Internet technical organizations called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA will not accept a transition proposal replacing its role with a government-led solution. The transition proposal must have broad community support and uphold four principles. NTIA has stated that it will not accept any transition proposal that would replace its role with a government-led solution. The transition proposal must have broad community support and uphold four principles to support the multistakeholder model, maintain Internet DNS security, meet global customer needs, and preserve Internet openness. Transferring authority over ICANN and DNS to the global Internet community is seen as a way for the U.S. government to strengthen its support for the multistakeholder model. Supporters of the transition argue that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and enable the United States to effectively oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. The U.S. government will support the multistakeholder model of Internet governance to oppose intergovernmental control. Transition of ICANN and DNS to global community is seen as a step towards privatization. The inception of ICANN aimed for the eventual privatization of DNS functions. NTIA believes ICANN is now mature enough for this transition, but critics fear loss of oversight without NTIA's role as a \"backstop\". Critics are concerned that without NTIA's oversight, foreign governments may gain more influence over the Internet, potentially harming US interests. Critics fear that increased intergovernmental control over the Internet, particularly from foreign governments, could harm US interests if NTIA's authority over ICANN and the DNS is removed. Concerns also arise about the development of a new international multistakeholder entity overseeing the domain name system, potentially allowing for foreign governments advocating for Internet censorship to gain influence. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new Internet governance mechanism that no longer has U.S. government oversight. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prevent the NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the domain name system until a report on NTIA's role is submitted to Congress by GAO. The DOTCOM Act introduced by Representative Shimkus aims to prevent the NTIA from giving up oversight of the Internet domain name system until a report is submitted to Congress by GAO. The report will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the change, address national security concerns, and define the term \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking. The DOTCOM Act introduced by Representative Shimkus requires a report to Congress by GAO on the role of the NTIA regarding the Internet domain name system. The report will analyze advantages, disadvantages, and address national security concerns. H.R. 4342 was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014. The DOTCOM Act, introduced by Representative Shimkus, requires a GAO report on NTIA's role in Internet domain name system governance. H.R. 4342 was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014, leading to further examination of NTIA's authority over IANA. The House Energy and Commerce Committee requested the GAO to examine the Administration's proposal to transition NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. The DOTCOM Act, offered as an amendment to H.R. 4435, was passed by the House on May 22, 2014, with a vote of 245-177. The House Armed Services bill report emphasized the need for new Internet governance structures to include protections for the Department of Defense-controlled .mil domain. The House Armed Services Committee supported new Internet governance structures to protect the .mil domain and maintain separation between policymaking and technical operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported its version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act on June 2, 2014. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported maintaining separation between policymaking and technical operations of the .mil domain and recommended transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community. Section 1646 of S. 2410 recommends transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, with the condition that the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol address numbers used by the Department of Defense for national security remain exclusively under DOD control. The committee recommended transferring the US Government's role in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, with the condition that '.MIL' domain and IP address numbers used by the Department of Defense remain under DOD control. DOD was urged to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers and seek an agreement with ICANN during the IANA transition process. The committee recommended transferring the US Government's role in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, with the condition that '.MIL' domain and IP address numbers used by the Department of Defense remain under DOD control. DOD was urged to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers and seek an agreement with ICANN during the IANA transition process to ensure the .mil domain retains its current status. The .mil domain will maintain its generic top-level domain status after the transition, as stated in the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The Act does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Congress recommends DOD to support the IANA transfer only if certain conditions are met. The President signed Fiscal Year 2015 on December 16, 2014 (P.L. 113-235), which does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers, especially for national security purposes. The Department of Defense should support the IANA transfer with assurances for protecting legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers used for national security. Consensus-based decision making and accountability processes in the multi-stakeholder approach must be upheld. The Secretary of Defense should ensure transparency, security, and efficiency to maintain a free, open, and resilient Internet. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660 on May 8, 2014, to sustain the successful stewardship of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660 on May 8, 2014, to sustain the successful stewardship of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense.

The Senate passed S.Res. 71 on February 5, 2015, emphasizing the need for accountability and governance reforms at ICANN. A hearing was held on February 25, 2015, to discuss the transition of the stewardship of the IANA functions. ICANN is working on a multistakeholder process to reach consensus on the transition. On February 25, 2015, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on \"Preserving the Multistakeholder Model of Internet Governance.\" Testimony was heard from NTIA, ICANN, and others regarding the transition process. ICANN has initiated a multistakeholder community effort to reach consensus on the transition proposal, focusing on IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. ICANN is working on a transition proposal for the IANA functions stewardship. A steering group will oversee the process in an open and inclusive manner, with representatives from various ICANN constituencies and affected parties. The proposal includes the formation of a steering group to oversee the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner. This group will consist of representatives from ICANN constituencies and parties directly affected by the transition. After receiving public comments, ICANN announced the formation of a Coordination Group responsible for preparing the transition proposal. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed by ICANN to prepare a transition proposal involving 30 individuals from 13 communities. Their mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal among the affected communities. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) consists of 30 individuals from 13 communities, selected by their respective communities. The ICG's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal for the three primary IANA functions. The three operational communities associated with each function will develop individual proposals, which the ICG will consolidate into a single proposal. The ICG has requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by the operational communities. The current status of the proposals is as follows: Domain Names proposal by CWG-Stewardship is in progress, with a target submission date of June 2015. Number Resources proposal by Consolidated RIR.

The Number Resources proposal by CRISP Team was submitted to the ICG on January 15, 2015. The Protocol Parameters proposal by IANAPLAN WG is also in progress. The ICG received the final proposals for Number Resources and Protocol Parameters in January 2015. However, consensus on the domain name function proposal has been challenging for the CWG-Stewardship group. The IETF submitted its protocol parameter proposal to the ICG on January 6, 2015. While Number Resources and Protocol Parameter proposals were completed in January 2015, consensus on the domain name function proposal has been difficult for the CWG-Stewardship group, with a deadline extension to June 2015. This challenge may be due to the fact that numbering and protocols are handled by external groups, while the domain name IANA function is performed by ICANN itself. The CWG-Stewardship group has faced challenges in meeting the deadline for the domain name function proposal, which has been extended to June 2015. The debate revolves around whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should continue with enhanced oversight. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should have authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has also started a process to enhance its accountability to Internet stakeholders. ICANN is considering whether it should have authority over the IANA function with enhanced accountability measures. A separate process is also underway to enhance ICANN's accountability to Internet stakeholders in the absence of its historical contractual relationship with the U.S. government. ICANN is exploring ways to strengthen its accountability to Internet stakeholders post-termination of the IANA contract with the U.S. government. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been established to develop proposals for enhancing ICANN's accountability mechanisms. ICANN has formed a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) to enhance its accountability mechanisms. The CCWG-Accountability consists of 25 members and 141 participants working on proposals. Meetings will be open to interested individuals, but decisions will be made by consensus. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants contributing to mailing list conversations and meetings. Decisions will be made by consensus. The CCWG will be open to any interested person as a participant, with the ability to attend and participate in meetings but not partake in the decision-making process. Additionally, up to seven advisors selected by a Public Experts Group will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants contributing to mailing list conversations and meetings. Up to seven advisors selected by a Public Experts Group will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams, with Work Stream 1 focusing on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability within the time frame of the IANA Stewardship Transition. The CCWG, consisting of 25 members and 141 participants, is working on two interrelated Work Streams to enhance ICANN accountability. Work Stream 1 focuses on mechanisms needed by September 30, 2015, while Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics beyond the IANA Stewardship Transition. If approved, an accountability proposal will be submitted. The IANA Stewardship Transition may occur as early as September 30, 2015. Work Stream 2 deals with accountability topics extending beyond the transition. If approved, the accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for review. The Workstream 1 proposal is set to be submitted in June 2015. The accountability proposal for the IANA Stewardship Transition will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval or potential modifications. The Workstream 1 proposal is scheduled for submission in June 2015, while the Workstream 2 proposal will follow after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA's approval is necessary for the transition to proceed. The ICANN Board will review the accountability proposal for the IANA Stewardship Transition in June 2015. The Workstream 2 proposal will be submitted after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA's approval is required for the transition to occur. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before the contract's expiration. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before the contract's current expiration date of September 30, 2015. Nor will they use funds to amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign to eliminate NTIA's role in approving changes to the root zone file before September 30. Congress's legislative language is clear on these points. NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan, as required by Congress. They will participate in meetings to keep Congress informed of the transition process. NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan, as required by Congress. They will participate in meetings with ICANN, Verisign, other governments, and the stakeholder community to provide regular updates on the transition process. The NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan. They will participate in meetings with ICANN, Verisign, other governments, and the stakeholder community to provide updates on the process. The focus is on supporting an open and participatory multistakeholder process where all ideas are welcome, emphasizing the importance of getting the transition right. Everyone is encouraged to participate responsibly. Administrator Strickling emphasized the importance of an open and participatory multistakeholder process for the transition plan. He urged the community to consider all proposal models and ensure a well-thought-out plan that addresses all concerns. Administrator Strickling emphasized the need for an open and participatory multistakeholder process for the transition plan. He called on the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all proposal models and ensure accountability in any new organizational structures replacing NTIA's oversight of the IANA functions. NTIA highlighted the importance of stress testing proposed solutions to safeguard against future contingencies like attempts to influence or take over ICANN. NTIA emphasized the need for accountability in the transition plan to replace its oversight of the IANA functions contract. Stress testing proposed solutions is crucial to prevent future attempts to influence or take over ICANN. The accountability process should address issues like removing or replacing board members and improving current accountability tools. The NTIA emphasized the need for accountability in the transition plan to replace its oversight of the IANA functions contract. Stress testing proposed solutions is crucial to prevent future attempts to influence or take over ICANN. The group is encouraged to address questions on how to remove or replace board members and improve current accountability tools. NTIA has stated that both transition processes should remain in sync and a coordinated and complete transition plan is necessary. Timing for delivering the transition plan is a key focus for both groups. NTIA emphasized the need for accountability in the transition plan to replace its oversight of the IANA functions contract.

Timing for delivering the transition plan is a key focus for both groups, aiming to deliver a plan in the summer with flexibility to extend the contract if needed. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership from around the world, including the Board of Directors and various constituency groups. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) is also part of ICANN. The transition plan for replacing NTIA's oversight of the IANA functions contract is expected to be delivered in the summer, with flexibility to extend the contract if needed. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership from around the world. The ICANN Board of Directors and constituency groups shape policy decisions globally. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) provides advice on public policy matters, but the ICANN Board is not obligated to follow it. Many foreign governments are involved in ICANN's international community. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) advises the ICANN Board on public policy matters and government concerns, but the Board is not required to follow the advice. Many argue for ICANN to be overseen by a higher intergovernmental body, as debated at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003. The international community, including foreign governments, believes the U.S. should not have sole authority over ICANN and the DNS. The United Nations discussed greater international involvement in Internet governance at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 stating no single government should dominate international governance. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) studied achieving greater international involvement in Internet governance, proposing the creation of a new global forum for stakeholders. The report emphasized that no single government should have a dominant role in international Internet governance. Four models were suggested, including options linked to the UN, with the aim of further internationalizing Internet governance. The report on international Internet governance proposed the creation of a new global forum for stakeholders and suggested four models, including options linked to the UN. ICANN's role could potentially change under three of the models, with U.S. officials opposing transferring control from ICANN to any international body. The report on international Internet governance proposed four models, with options linked to the UN. U.S. officials opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. The EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in governing. The 109th Congress and the European Union initially supported U.S. control over ICANN. However, the EU later shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in Internet governance. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an agreement in November 2005, maintaining ICANN and U.S. roles in the domain name system. An Internet governance agreement was reached in November 2005 to avert conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit. The agreement maintained ICANN and the United States' roles in the domain name system, while also establishing the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) under the U.N. for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was set to run through 2010. A new international group, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in 2010 for another five years. In December 2010, the U.N. General Assembly renewed the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) for another five years and tasked the U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) to develop a report on improvements. Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 regarding new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and the addition of the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on increased government influence on ICANN policy development. In 2010 and 2011, controversies arose over new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on increased government influence on ICANN policy. Some governments, including the US, Canada, and the EU, support the current multistakeholder model but advocate for a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Other nations like Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA) prefer the creation of a new Internet policy development entity. Governments like the US, Canada, and the EU support the current ICANN multistakeholder model but want a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA) prefer a new Internet policy development entity within the U.N. system. Russia and China proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security.\" A new Internet policy development entity within the U.N. system is proposed to oversee existing bodies like ICANN. Russia and China suggest an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly, promoting multilateral management of the Internet. The International Code of Conduct for Information Security promotes multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet. It emphasizes equal responsibility for all states in governing the Internet and ensuring its security, continuity, and development. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012, emphasized the need for all states to have equal responsibility in governing the Internet to ensure its security, continuity, and development. The conference aimed to establish multilateral, transparent, and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms for equitable resource distribution and universal access. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012, convened by the ITU, aimed to revise the ITRs to govern international telecommunications traffic and address policy questions related to the Internet's evolution. The WCIT was a meeting to revise the ITRs, a global treaty governing international telecommunications traffic. Key policy questions included how to address Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. The Administration and Congress advocated for the new ITRs to focus on traditional telecommunications traffic and maintain a multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The WCIT focused on revising the ITRs, with key policy questions surrounding Internet traffic and governance. The Administration and Congress supported maintaining a multistakeholder model for Internet governance and opposed any ITU actions extending jurisdiction over the Internet. Concerns in the 112th Congress grew over potential intergovernmental control over the Internet at the WCIT. The 112th Congress expressed concerns about the WCIT potentially increasing intergovernmental control over the Internet. A hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to preserve the multistakeholder governance model. On May 31, 2012, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet.\" H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to support the multistakeholder governance model and promote a global Internet free from government control.

The 113th Congress is expected to monitor the ongoing debate on Internet governance and oversee U.S. government efforts to oppose intergovernmental control. H.R. 1580, introduced by Representative Walden, affirms the U.S. policy on Internet governance, similar to previous congressional resolutions. H.R. 1580, introduced by Representative Walden, affirms the U.S. policy on Internet governance to preserve the multistakeholder model. It was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. In October 2013, ICANN's President and other Internet infrastructure leaders met in Uruguay to call for global coordination. In May 2013, H.R. 1580 was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives to preserve the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. In October 2013, ICANN's President and other leaders called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation to prevent fragmentation and maintain trust. Uruguay released a statement emphasizing the importance of global multistakeholder Internet cooperation and warned against Internet fragmentation at a national level. They expressed concern over trust issues due to surveillance, identified the need to address Internet Governance challenges, and called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN. The Montevideo Statement highlighted the erosion of trust among Internet users globally due to surveillance, emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to address Internet Governance challenges. It called for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions to involve all stakeholders equally. Additionally, plans for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014 were announced during a meeting between the Presidents of ICANN and Brazil. The Montevideo Statement called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, with plans announced for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014. NETmundial, a global multistakeholder meeting on Internet governance, was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, focusing on crafting Internet governance. NETmundial, a global governance summit in April 2014, included representatives from government, industry, civil society, and academia. The meeting in Sao Paulo focused on crafting Internet governance principles and produced a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" outlining general principles and future discussion topics.

The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan concluded in November 2014, setting general policies and electing officials. The U.S. delegation had concerns about potential expansion of ITU's role in Internet governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Korea in November 2014 aimed to set general policies, adopt strategic plans, and elect officials. The U.S. delegation had concerns about expanding ITU's role in Internet governance, but the conference concluded successfully without such expansion. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses. The State Department viewed the ITU conference as successful, deciding not to expand its role in Internet governance or cybersecurity. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, with country codes like .us and generic TLDs like .com. ICANN established 22 gTLDs after holding application rounds in 2000 and 2004. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, such as country codes like .us and generic TLDs like .com. ICANN established 22 gTLDs through application rounds in 2000 and 2004, with some reserved for specific organizations and others open for registration by anyone. Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial and non-profit organizations seeking to operate name servers for their TLD. There are currently 22 gTLDs in operation, some reserved or restricted to specific organizations, while others are open for registration by anyone. Applicants for new gTLDs are usually commercial and non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition to establish and operate name servers for their TLD registry. ICANN began a consultative process in 2005 to expand the number of gTLDs due to the growth of the Internet and demand for domain names. ICANN started a consultative process in 2005 to expand the number of gTLDs, allowing commercial and non-profit organizations to establish and operate name servers for their TLD registry. Between 2008 and 2011, ICANN released seven iterations of its gTLD Applicant Guidebook to implement the new gTLD program. ICANN developed rules and procedures for introducing an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system. Between 2008 and 2011, seven iterations of the gTLD Applicant Guidebook were released. In June 2011, the ICANN Board approved the launch of the new gTLD program, allowing potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be approved and introduced into the DNS. Applications for new gTLDs were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with an application fee of $185,000. The ICANN Board approved the new gTLD program in June 2011, allowing for the introduction of potentially hundreds of new gTLDs into the DNS. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a required fee of $185,000. The program has faced controversy from trademark holders and governments over concerns about higher costs and intellectual property protections. ICANN's approval of the new gTLD program has sparked controversy among trademark holders and governments due to concerns about higher costs and intellectual property protections. Governments, through the Governmental Advisory Committee, have advocated for additional protections in the new gTLD process. Governments, through the Governmental Advisory Committee, advocated for more intellectual property protections and stringent rules in the new gTLD process to combat cybercrimes. Strong opposition from trademark holders and some parts of the U.S. government, including the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, arose towards the end of 2011. The GAC advocated for stricter rules in the new gTLD process to enhance law enforcement and consumer protection. Despite opposition from trademark holders and some U.S. government bodies, ICANN defended its gTLD program at December 2011 hearings. ICANN defended its gTLD program at December 2011 hearings, stating its intention to proceed with the gTLD expansion as planned. The new gTLDs aim to offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. Critics had ample opportunity to contribute input during a seven-year policy development process. Ultimately, ICANN did not delay the initiation of the new gTLD program. ICANN defended its gTLD program, stating its intention to proceed with the expansion as planned. The new gTLDs aim to offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. ICANN opened the application window on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including geographic and Internationalized Domain Names. On June 13, 2012, ICANN announced receiving 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including geographic and Internationalized Domain Names in scripts like Chinese, Arabic, and Cyrillic. ICANN moved into the evaluation phase to decide on accepting the applications, a multi-tiered and complex process that could involve extended evaluation, dispute resolution for objections, and resolving string contention among applicants. ICANN is in the process of evaluating 1,930 new gTLD applications, which could take 9 to 20 months depending on various factors. The rules and procedures for evaluation are outlined in ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been approved. The approval and delegation of new gTLDs can take 9 to 20 months after the application window closes. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the rules and procedures for evaluation. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, with 894 currently in the process. ICANN plans for a second round of applications with changes to the process. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, with 894 currently in the process. ICANN plans for a second round of applications with changes to the process to address concerns about domain name abuse. The new gTLD program aims to develop a systemized application process. Concerns exist about domain name abuse in the new gTLD spaces, including trademark infringement and consumer fraud. ICANN's approach to addressing these issues, such as intellectual property protection and mitigating unlawful behavior, will be closely monitored. Policymakers see domain names as a tool for protecting children. The effectiveness of ICANN's approach to addressing intellectual property protection and unlawful behavior in the new gTLD domain spaces will be of interest as the program progresses. Legislation was enacted in the 107th Congress to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" for age-appropriate content. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 authorized NTIA to require the .us domain. Legislation in the 107th Congress created a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" for age-appropriate content, known as kids.us. An adult content top level domain name for filtering by parents has also been considered in past Congresses. Legislation in the 107th Congress created a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" for age-appropriate content, known as kids.us. In the past, there were bills introduced to establish an adult content top-level domain name for material deemed \"harmful to minors.\" In previous Congresses, bills were introduced to require ICANN to establish a mandatory top-level domain for material deemed harmful to minors, but they did not progress. ICANN has considered adding a generic top-level domain for adult content since 2000 and entered negotiations with a registry company in 2005. ICANN considered adding a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites in 2005, entering negotiations with ICM Registry. Registration would be voluntary, and existing sites would not be affected. The proposal sparked controversy. The ICANN Board was set to approve the creation of a new \".xxx\" domain for adult websites in 2005. The Department of Commerce requested additional time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children. The Department of Commerce requested more time for ICANN to address objections regarding the creation of the .xxx domain for adult content. The ICANN Board authorized negotiations with ICM Registry to resolve concerns raised by the DOC and the Governmental Advisory Committee. ICANN's Board initially opposed the creation of a .xxx domain for adult content, despite negotiations with ICM Registry to address concerns raised by the Department of Commerce and the Governmental Advisory Committee. The Board later voted to deny the .xxx domain in March 2007. On May 10, 2006, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 against accepting a proposed agreement for a .xxx domain. In January 2007, a revised agreement was published for public comment. However, in March 2007, the Board voted 9-5 to deny the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to manage Internet content. Subsequently, ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel. The ICANN Board initially denied the .xxx domain due to reluctance to manage Internet content. ICM Registry challenged this decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating that their application met the required criteria. The Independent Review Panel ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating that their application for the .xxx TLD met the required criteria. The ICANN Board's decision to deny the domain was deemed inconsistent with neutral and fair policy application. The final approval of ICM's application was left to the ICANN Board of Directors. The IRP ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating their .xxx TLD application met criteria. ICANN Board decided to allow the application to proceed after a vote in Brussels. Next steps included due diligence and negotiations for a registry agreement. The ICANN Board approved ICM's .xxx TLD application to move forward after a vote in Brussels. Next steps included due diligence, negotiations for a registry agreement, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. At a later meeting in Cartegena, the Board passed a resolution to enter into a formal consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. ICANN approved ICM's .xxx TLD application and planned to enter into a registry agreement after consulting with the Governmental Advisory Committee. The Board acknowledged conflicts with GAC advice in a letter in February 2011 regarding the .xxx registry agreement. The ICANN Board approved a resolution in March 2011 to allow the CEO or General Counsel to execute the registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx TLD, despite conflicts with GAC advice. The ICANN Board approved the resolution in March 2011 for the .xxx TLD despite objections, with a vote of nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. The .xxx domain became available in December 2011, emphasizing the importance of DNS security and stability. The ICANN Board approved the .xxx TLD in March 2011 with a vote of nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. The .xxx domain became available in December 2011, highlighting the importance of DNS security. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to address vulnerabilities in the DNS system. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to address vulnerabilities in the DNS system, including the intrinsic vulnerability that allows malicious parties to distribute false DNS information. This technology digitally \"signs\" DNS data to assure the validity of transmitted DNS addresses, with \"signing the root\" being a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks. On October 9, 2009, NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) seeking public comment on DNS security. DNSSEC assures DNS address validity by digitally signing data. \"Signing the root\" is crucial in protecting against attacks. NTIA sought public comment on DNSSEC deployment in the root zone. NTIA collaborated with NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign to develop an interim approach for DNSSEC deployment. The NTIA sought public comment on deploying DNSSEC in the Internet's DNS infrastructure, including the root zone. Collaboration with NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign led to the development of an interim approach for DNSSEC deployment. NTIA filed a notice for public comments on testing and evaluation, leading to the implementation of domain name system security extensions in the root zone. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor, and root operators began serving the signed root zone. On June 9, 2010, NTIA filed a notice in the Federal Register for public comments on DNSSEC implementation in the root zone. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor on July 15, 2010, and root operators started serving the signed root zone with actual keys. DNSSEC requires voluntary adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to enhance protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. DNSSEC must be voluntarily adopted by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators globally to enhance protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. Domain name registrants are required to provide contact information for the WHOIS database, which has been a contentious issue regarding privacy concerns. The WHOIS database contains contact information (phone number, address, email) of domain name registrants, sparking debate over its accessibility. Privacy advocates argue for limited access, while businesses, law enforcement, and the U.S. government advocate for continued public access. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on WHOIS data accessibility. The WHOIS database contains contact information of domain name registrants. Privacy advocates argue for limited access, while businesses and the U.S. government advocate for continued public access. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on WHOIS data accessibility, with a narrow technical definition favored by privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial user constituencies. The GNSO approved a narrow technical definition for public WHOIS data display, supported by privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial users. Opponents urged ICANN to reconsider limiting access to WHOIS data. At ICANN's June 2006 meeting, opponents of limiting access to WHOIS data continued urging ICANN to reconsider the working definition. On October 31, 2007, the GNSO voted to defer a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies. The GNSO also rejected a proposal to allow Internet users the option of listing third party contact information rather than their own private data. Currently, the GNSO is exploring several extensive studies of WHOIS. On June 22, 2011, ICANN announced four separate studies of WHOIS, recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee in 2008. The studies focus on WHOIS \"misuse,\" registrant identification, proxy and privacy \"abuse,\" and the feasibility of a privacy reveal study. The ICANN initiated four studies of WHOIS in 2011, recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee in 2008. These studies focused on WHOIS \"misuse,\" registrant identification, proxy and privacy \"abuse,\" and the feasibility of a privacy reveal study.
