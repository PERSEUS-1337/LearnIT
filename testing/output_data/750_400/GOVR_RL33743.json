    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) are trade agreements that may require TPA to pass implementing legislation. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years, allowing for expedited consideration and voting on trade agreement implementing legislation without amendment, provided certain conditions are met. The President has TPA/fast track authority to consider trade agreement implementing legislation quickly and vote on it without amendment, as long as certain conditions are met. TPA clarifies Congress's authority over trade policy while giving the President negotiating leverage. Earlier versions of TPA were controversial. The expiration of TPA raises central questions about Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy and the increasing complexity and partisanship of trade negotiations. Congressional renewal of TPA has become more controversial due to tighter oversight and consultation requirements. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has raised questions about its renewal, as trade negotiations have become more complex and partisan. Congress has tightened oversight and consultation requirements, making the renewal of TPA more controversial. TPA is the result of decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, rooted in their constitutional powers and the need for cooperative flexibility. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has raised questions about its renewal, as trade negotiations have become more complex and partisan. TPA is the product of decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, rooted in their constitutional powers and the need for cooperative flexibility. The evolution of TPA shows that the congressional-executive partnership on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained as political and economic conditions evolve. The evolution of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) demonstrates the need for cooperative flexibility in negotiating reciprocal trade agreements. The partnership between Congress and the executive branch on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained as political and economic conditions evolve. Congress holds authority over regulating foreign trade, while the President has no specific responsibility for trade. The U.S. Constitution assigns authority over foreign trade regulation to Congress, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. Both branches play a role in developing and executing U.S. trade agreements. The President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements, while Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products for the first 150 years of the United States. Tariffs were the main trade policy instrument and a primary source of federal revenue. During the first 150 years of the United States, Congress set tariff rates on imported products as the main trade policy instrument and federal revenue source. Trade debates often revolved around protectionist tariffs for northern manufacturing regions versus low tariffs for southern commodity exporting regions. The President's role was primarily to negotiate and implement bilateral treaties with Senate approval. In the 1930s, the President's role in setting trade policy shifted with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which changed U.S. trade policy significantly. The Act benefitted those advocating protectionist tariffs and impacted trade relations with treaty partners. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 drastically altered U.S. trade policy by imposing high tariff rates in response to the Great Depression. This led to retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, severely restricting trade and worsening the effects of the depression. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed high tariff rates in response to the Great Depression, leading to retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners and worsening the economic effects. This prompted the enactment of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, allowing the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) authorized the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements that reduced tariffs within pre-approved levels on an MFN basis. Congress delegated expanded trade agreements authority to the President for the first time, allowing him to implement new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) allowed the President to reduce tariffs within pre-approved levels on an MFN basis without additional legislation. This delegation of trade authority aimed to alleviate political pressure from special interests faced by Congress. The RTAA replaced the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act as the last general tariff legislation. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 delegated trade authority to the President to reduce tariffs within pre-approved levels on an MFN basis. This aimed to alleviate political pressure from special interests faced by Congress. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the last general tariff legislation, is now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress retained broader trade authority and safeguarded against executive branch overreach by subjecting the trade agreements authority to legislative oversight. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 delegated tariff-cutting authority to the President on an MFN basis, aiming to reduce political pressure on Congress. Tariffs now only apply to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status, known as normal trade relations status (NTR). Congress maintained broader trade authority and ensured oversight by subjecting trade agreements to periodic review and renewal. Tariff levels decreased, reducing their impact as trade barriers. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 granted tariff-cutting authority to the President on an MFN basis to reduce political pressure on Congress. Tariffs now only apply to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress renewed presidential trade agreements authority for tariff reductions 11 times until 1962. General tariff levels declined, and with the establishment of GATT in 1947, trade negotiations shifted to multilateral forums. Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority for five years to enter into agreements. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate the reduction or elimination of tariffs for five years. It also increased Congress's role in the negotiating process by requiring the President to submit each agreement for congressional review. The act expanded trade negotiations beyond tariffs and shifted the major forum for trade negotiations to multilateral forums with the establishment of GATT in 1947. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority for five years to negotiate tariff reduction agreements. It expanded Congress's role by requiring agreements to be submitted for review. This allowed the President to conclude the GATT Kennedy Round, focusing on tariff reduction and nontariff barriers. The GATT Kennedy Round (1963-1967) focused on tariff reduction and nontariff barriers. Agreements were reached in two areas related to nontariff barriers: customs valuation and antidumping practices. The GATT Kennedy Round (1963-1967) focused on tariff reduction and nontariff barriers, specifically customs valuation and antidumping practices. Congress opposed nontariff commitments that required changes in U.S. laws beyond tariff modifications. The Kennedy Round of the GATT (1963-1967) addressed tariff reduction and nontariff barriers, including customs valuation and antidumping practices. Congress objected to nontariff commitments that necessitated changes in U.S. laws beyond tariffs. This led to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements to resolve the debate on nontariff barrier rules dominating future multilateral trade agreements. The Kennedy Round of the GATT focused on reducing tariffs and addressing nontariff barriers. Congress objected to nontariff commitments requiring changes in U.S. laws, leading to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. This was prompted by concerns over presidential encroachment on legislative authority. The tariff modification authority expired in 1967, but Congress did not renew it for seven years. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 expired in 1967, prompting Congress to seek a legislative remedy. The Nixon Administration sought new authority to negotiate the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act of 1974. This act provided the President with the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs within certain parameters. The Trade Act of 1974 renewed the President's authority for seven years to negotiate trade agreements that reduced tariffs. It also required implementing legislation for agreements that involved changes beyond tariff modifications. The Trade Act of 1974 renewed the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements that reduced tariffs within certain parameters. The act stipulated that nontariff barrier agreements could only enter into force with implementing legislation passed by Congress. Some argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary congressional debate would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreements authority to the President. The Trade Act of 1974 renewed the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements, with some arguing that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary congressional debate would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreements authority to the President. Members recognized the potential problem of U.S. trading partners being reluctant to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment. The Senate Finance Committee report emphasized the need for agreements negotiated by the Executive to be given an up-or-down vote by Congress. The Trade Act of 1974 renewed the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements, with the Senate Finance Committee emphasizing the need for agreements negotiated by the Executive to be given an up-or-down vote by Congress. Trading partners expressed reluctance to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment, leading to the need for assurances that agreements would be voted on within a definite time-frame. Negotiators need assurances that negotiated agreements will be voted on promptly by Congress. To address this, Congress agreed to expedite trade agreements by suspending regular legislative procedures, limiting committee review time, and imposing time-limited debates with no amendments on implementing bills. Congress agreed to expedite trade agreements by suspending regular legislative procedures, limiting committee review time, and imposing time-limited debates with no amendments on implementing bills. This included requiring the executive branch to consult with relevant committees during negotiations and notifying Congress 90 days before signing an agreement. Additionally, the act allowed for the accreditation of 10 Members of Congress as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators, an increase from the previous five advisers provided for in the Trade Act of 1962. The Trade Act of 1974 expedited trade agreements by limiting committee review time, imposing time-limited debates, and accrediting 10 Members of Congress as advisers to the U.S. negotiators. This \"fast track\" authority led to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT, resulting in agreements on NTBs like government procurement practices. The Trade Act of 1974 established \"fast track\" trade negotiating authority, leading to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT in 1979. This round resulted in agreements on NTBs such as government procurement practices, product standards, customs regulations, and antidumping procedures. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first implementing bill passed under the expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 addressed NTBs like government procurement practices, product standards, customs regulations, and antidumping procedures. It was the first trade implementing bill passed under expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures established in the Trade Act of 1974. The legislative procedures, ensconced in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, have remained unchanged since 1974 but have been revised by Congress over the years. The expedited legislative procedures established in the Trade Act of 1974 have not changed since 1974 and are found in Sections 151-154. These provisions do not have sunset provisions but are subject to time limits. Congress has revised them over the years, with the initial grant of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" and tariff modification authority in effect until January 2, 1980. Residual presidential authority for tariff modifications was extended to January 2, 1982. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, but did not extend tariff modification authority. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. This act amended the Trade Act of 1974 to allow for the negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements, considering the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. It amended the Trade Act of 1974 to allow for negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. Congress considered these FTAs and waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA. The President was required to notify Congress 60 days prior to entering negotiations with other countries for FTAs. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. It amended the Trade Act of 1974 to allow for negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress 60 days prior to negotiations with other countries for FTAs. Congressional approval via implementing legislation was necessary for agreements leading to tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, but only allowed expedited procedures for agreements made before June 1, 1991. Agreements after that date but before June 1, 1993, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, but only allowed expedited procedures for agreements made before June 1, 1991. Agreements after that date but before June 1, 1993, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President requested an extension of such authority and it was not disapproved by either the House or the Senate. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. Agreements after June 1, 1991, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President requested an extension and it was not disapproved by Congress. Congress could also withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval. Congress greatly expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed implementing legislation for NAFTA in 1993. Under the OTCA provisions, Congress expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed NAFTA implementing legislation in 1993. Congress extended authority for Uruguay Round negotiations with H.R. 1876, signed into law in July 1993 (P.L. 103-49). The Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented in 1993 under P.L. 103-182. Congress extended authority for Uruguay Round negotiations with H.R. 1876, signed into law in July 1993 (P.L. 103-49), until April 16, 1994. The Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009; P.L. 107-210) renewed trade agreements authority after it expired in 1994. The fast track authority for trade agreements was renewed in 2002 after expiring in 1994. Congress showed strong support for the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1994, with a long hiatus until the Trade Act of 2002 was passed. In 1997, legislation to renew fast track authority was reported out by Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, but it was pulled before a floor vote due to lack of support. In September 1998, the House voted on fast track authority legislation, but it failed to pass. Congress did not enact new trade agreements authority for the Clinton Administration, possibly due to lack of support. In September 1998, the House voted on fast track authority legislation, but it failed to pass (180-243). Reasons for Congress's decision included disagreement on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues between Republican leadership and the Clinton Administration. The WTO's failure to launch a new round also played a role. The Clinton Administration and Republicans disagreed on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues under fast track authority. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations in 1999 stalled major trade talks, making renewal of trade agreements authority less of a political priority. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal, renaming it \"trade promotion authority (TPA).\" In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, renaming it \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, also known as TPA, renewed the trade promotion authority previously called fast track. It included new provisions for labor and environmental issues but did not require enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, known as TPA, included new provisions for labor and environmental issues but did not mandate enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. It created the Congressional Oversight Group (COG) for additional congressional consultation. The original House version of the BPTA (H.R. 3005) passed by one vote (215-214). The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 included a mechanism for congressional consultation through the Congressional Oversight Group (COG). The original House version of the bill passed by one vote (215-214) along party lines. It was later combined with other trade-related legislation in the Senate and ultimately passed as H.R. 3009. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 passed by one vote (215-214) along party lines. It was combined with other trade-related legislation in the Senate and ultimately passed as H.R. 3009. The legislation included renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance, the Andean Trade Preference Act, and the Generalized System of Preferences. Congress approved implementing legislation for Free Trade Agreement countries under the 2002 version of TPA. The Trade Act of 2002, H.R. 3009, was adopted by the House (215-212) and Senate (64-34). The legislation approved implementing agreements for various Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed BCTPA, introduced in 2015, is modeled on previous trade acts but was not acted upon. The BCTPA legislation, introduced in 2015, is modeled on previous trade acts and was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. The BCTPA legislation, introduced in 2015, was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. It contains updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. TPA-2015, passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37, contains updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. It also includes provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. If enacted, TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021. The negotiating objectives of TPA-2015 include provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 may be used to consider agreements from ongoing negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) are potential agreements being negotiated with various countries to promote trade. The Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) is being negotiated with the European Union. The Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) aims to expand commitments in services trade. The Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) is being negotiated at the World Trade Organization to reduce barriers on goods for environmental promotion. Congress uses TPA/fast track to define trade policy priorities. Through TPA/fast track, Congress aims to define trade policy priorities and ensure that the executive branch adheres to these objectives in trade agreement negotiations. It also seeks to establish the terms and procedures for entering into trade agreements and implementing bills. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure executive branch adherence to these objectives in trade negotiations, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's constitutional authority over trade. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure executive branch adherence to objectives in trade negotiations, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's constitutional authority over trade. When trade negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers (NTBs), the process for implementing trade agreements changed. When trade negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers (NTBs), the process for implementing trade agreements changed. Previously, trade agreements were implemented by presidential proclamation without further congressional action if tariff rate reductions were within pre-approved limits. However, with the inclusion of NTBs, Congress tightened its control over trade agreements by requiring passage of implementing legislation for NTB agreements to enter into force for the United States. This led to the establishment of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" under the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" to tighten Congress's control over trade agreements, particularly those involving nontariff barriers (NTBs). This authority required implementing legislation for NTB agreements to enter into force for the United States, with expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress. The Trade Act of 1974 established expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). TPA requires certain conditions to be met for a bill to qualify as a trade implementing bill, including progress in meeting negotiating objectives and fulfilling notification and consultation requirements. The Trade Act of 1974 established Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for expedited procedures in Congress for trade implementing bills. To qualify, the trade agreement must meet TPA's negotiating objectives, fulfill notification and consultation requirements, and the implementing bill must only contain necessary changes to implement the agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 established Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for expedited procedures in Congress for trade implementing bills. The implementing bill must contain provisions approving the agreement and necessary changes to implement it, with Congress having explicit control over the approval and implementation of trade agreements. Congress has granted Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for expedited procedures in trade implementing bills, giving explicit control over approval and implementation of trade agreements. The President is authorized to proclaim the agreement into force after ensuring partner countries comply with its provisions, as outlined in Section 2105 of the Trade Act of 2002. In a trade implementing bill, Congress grants the President authority to proclaim trade agreements into force after partner countries comply with provisions. This authority is defined in Section 2105 of the Trade Act of 2002, requiring notification to Congress 90 days before signing the agreement for review and input. The Trade Act of 2002, Section 2105, outlines the process for trade agreements to enter into force, including notifying Congress 90 days before signing, providing a list of required changes within 60 days of signing, and transmitting a copy to Congress after the agreement is entered into. The Trade Act of 2002, Section 2105, outlines the process for trade agreements to enter into force, including notifying Congress 90 days before signing, providing a list of required changes within 60 days of signing, and transmitting a copy to Congress after the agreement is entered into. The Trade Act of 2002 outlines the process for trade agreements to enter into force, including notifying Congress, providing required changes, and transmitting legal text, implementing bill, and supporting statements. If Congress is satisfied, expedited legislative procedures will be followed as defined in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 2002 outlines the process for trade agreements to enter into force, including notifying Congress, providing required changes, and transmitting legal text, implementing bill, and supporting statements. If Congress is satisfied, expedited legislative procedures will be followed as defined in the Trade Act of 1974. The implementing bill must meet the statute's requirements and be enacted into law, with Congress agreeing to certain expedited legislative procedures. These rules require mandatory introduction of the bill in both houses of Congress and represent a significant departure from ordinary legislative procedures. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements, requiring mandatory introduction of the bill in Congress, automatic discharge from committees, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed, with a simple majority vote for passage. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements, including mandatory introduction of the bill in Congress, automatic discharge from committees, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed, with a simple majority vote for passage. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. The bill passes with a simple majority as Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, highlighting the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Congress, drawing on its constitutional authority, sets the objectives for the President to pursue in trade negotiations, aiming to maximize benefits for the United States and the global economy. The executive branch has some discretion in implementing these goals, but they serve as definitive statements of U.S. trade policy. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation to maximize benefits for the United States and the global economy. These objectives are definitive statements of U.S. trade policy that the Administration is expected to honor for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Trade negotiating objectives are central to the congressional debate on TPA, categorized into overall, principal, and other objectives. The Administration is expected to honor U.S. trade policy for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Trade negotiating objectives are central to the congressional debate on TPA, categorized into overall, principal, and other objectives. These objectives aim to enhance the U.S. and global economies by reducing barriers and distortions to trade. The objectives of trade negotiations include broad goals like enhancing U.S. and global economies, specific goals such as reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and ensuring fair regulatory practices. Other priorities include transparency, combating corruption, enforcing environmental and labor laws, and effective dispute settlement processes. The objectives of trade negotiations include reducing barriers to trade, protecting foreign investment and intellectual property rights, promoting transparency, fair regulatory practices, combating corruption, enforcing environmental and labor laws, and ensuring effective dispute settlement processes. The language defining trade negotiating objectives has been contested in the past, leading to controversy in the renewal of Trade Promotion Authority in 2002. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) negotiating objectives are crucial in shaping future trade agreements. The language defining these objectives has been a source of controversy in the past, impacting the approval of TPA. This highlights the significance of clear and non-contentious objectives for successful trade negotiations. The controversy surrounding TPA negotiating objectives reflects their importance as a template for future trade agreements. The labor provisions, a key focus in these objectives, have sparked contentious debates due to the lack of minimal enforceable standards in TPA. This issue has carried over to FTAs that adopted similar language on labor standards. The labor provisions in TPA negotiating objectives have sparked debates due to the lack of minimal enforceable standards. This issue has carried over to FTAs that adopted similar language on labor standards, leading to contentious debates in Congress. The 2005 debate on the CAFTA-DR implementing bill highlighted labor issues in trade agreements. Renewing TPA/fast track authority is crucial for Congress, as it extends trade agreements authority to the President with consultation requirements. The vote on renewing TPA/fast track authority is critical for Congress as it extends trade agreements authority to the President with consultation requirements, including with Congressional Advisory Groups. Notification and consultation requirements have been revised in each renewal of authority. The President must notify Congress and consult with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups before commencing trade negotiations, as detailed in the timeline in Appendix B. Before commencing trade negotiations, the President must notify Congress and consult with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups. This includes notifying Congress in writing at least 90 days prior to negotiations, consulting on the nature of the negotiations, and conducting special consultations on specific issues like agriculture and tariffs. Additionally, specific notifications and consultations are required before and after agreements are signed. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before and after trade agreements are signed. This includes notifying Congress 90 days prior to negotiations, consulting on the nature of the agreement, and special consultations on agriculture, tariffs, and other issues. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before and after trade agreements are signed, including consulting with relevant committees and notifying revenue committees of potential changes to trade remedy laws. Private sector advisory committee reports must be submitted to Congress, the President, and the USTR within 30 days of notifying Congress of the intention to enter into an agreement. The USITC must also be provided with trade information. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before and after trade agreements are signed, including consulting with relevant committees and notifying revenue committees of potential changes to trade remedy laws. Private sector advisory committee reports must be submitted to Congress, the President, and the USTR within 30 days of notifying Congress of the intention to enter into an agreement. The USITC must also be provided with trade information, including details of the agreement at least 90 days before entering into it, and presenting a report on the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy to Congress within 105 days after the agreement is signed. The text of the agreement must be released 60 days prior to entering into it. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before and after trade agreements are signed, including consulting with relevant committees and notifying revenue committees of potential changes to trade remedy laws. The USITC must be provided with trade information at least 90 days before entering into an agreement, and a report on the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy must be presented to Congress within 105 days after the agreement is signed. The text of the agreement must be released 60 days prior to entering into it. The congressional consultation process is a long-standing precedent and an integral part of TPA, reflecting Congress's interest in ensuring trade policy remains under its purview. The congressional consultation process is a key part of TPA, ensuring trade policy oversight by Congress. The effectiveness of this process was evaluated by the GAO, questioning its efficiency based on interviews with congressional staff and executive branch employees. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated the consultation process for FTAs under TPA from 2002 to 2007. Despite high-quality information and frequent meetings, congressional staff felt they had insufficient time for input and were often treated more as briefings than consultations. Many congressional staff felt they had insufficient time for input and were often treated more as briefings than consultations during the consultation process for FTAs under TPA. Last-minute changes to draft FTA texts were not always included, raising concerns about the need for greater and earlier congressional input into the drafting of FTAs. Many congressional staff expressed concerns that the consultation process for FTAs under TPA did not satisfy many in Congress, as it often felt more like briefings than consultations. There were worries about the lack of inclusion of last-minute changes to draft FTA texts, leading to calls for greater and earlier congressional input into the drafting of FTAs. Similar concerns were raised regarding consultation with the Administration over TPP and other pending trade negotiations. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent trade implementing bills from being delayed or obstructed by congressional procedures. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent trade implementing bills from being delayed or obstructed by congressional procedures. TPA procedures were designed to protect fragile consensus between trade partners from congressional amendments that would change the basic agreement. Trade agreements can be delayed by congressional procedures, but TPA procedures aim to prevent this by protecting consensus between trade partners. Congress retains authority over trade matters and includes provisions in TPA to limit expedited procedures. Renewals of trade agreements authority provide oversight through limited use of expedited procedures. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) includes provisions to limit expedited procedures and ensure congressional oversight over trade agreements. Renewals of TPA provide limited use of expedited procedures for implementing bills, with the 2015 statute extending this authority until July 1, 2021. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) 2015 extends expedited procedures for trade agreements until July 1, 2021, without a deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the expiration of the authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) 2015 extends expedited procedures for trade agreements until July 1, 2021. However, there is no deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the expiration of the authority. Implementing bills for FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea were not passed until October 12, 2011. The TPA legislation requires the President to request an extension of the TPA authority, which is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of the TPA authority, which is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution. Such resolutions have been reported out of committee in the past, but none have been passed in either House of Congress, serving as a reminder to the executive branch of Congress's prerogative over expedited legislative procedures. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of the TPA authority, which can be denied by Congress through disapproval resolutions. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch of Congress's control over expedited legislative procedures and the importance of fulfilling consultation and reporting obligations to preserve the congressional role in trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows Congress to deny an extension of TPA authority if dissatisfied with the President's trade agreement negotiations. The President must fulfill consultation and reporting obligations to preserve congressional influence on trade agreements. Congress can decide that an implementing bill is not eligible under TPA rules if the President fails to meet these requirements, using a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill. If the President fails to meet consultation and reporting obligations under TPA rules, Congress can use a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution to deem the implementing bill ineligible. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill if necessary. The Trade Act of 1974 allows expedited procedures for trade implementing bills in Congress, but each chamber can change or override these procedures as needed. Congress can use a joint resolution to deem an implementing bill ineligible if the President fails to consult or report under TPA rules. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill if necessary. The Trade Act of 1974 allows expedited procedures for trade implementing bills in Congress, with the recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules at any time. Congress reserves the right to withdraw or override these procedures with a vote. The success of TPA depends on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches and the two major political parties. The Trade Act of 1974 allows expedited procedures for trade implementing bills in Congress, with the success of TPA depending on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches and the two major political parties. Some have noted a lack of cooperation under previous TPAs, leading to strains on the trade legislative process. Since 1974, the Trade Act has allowed expedited procedures for trade bills, with success depending on cooperation between branches and parties. Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been lacking since 1993, leading to strains on the trade legislative process. Congress has integrated certain procedures during trade agreement approval, with support from the executive branch. Congress has integrated certain procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills, including reviewing the agreement before introducing the implementing bill. This process involves hearings before the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees. During the process of congressional approval of trade agreements, Congress reviews the agreement before introducing the implementing bill. This involves hearings before the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, followed by an informal markup session and a mock conference to gauge congressional response. During the congressional approval process of trade agreements, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees conduct hearings, followed by an informal markup session and a mock conference to assess congressional response to the implementing bill. The informal markup allows committee members to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal potential changes to the Administration. During the congressional approval process of trade agreements, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees conduct hearings, followed by an informal markup session and a mock conference to assess congressional response to the implementing bill. The meetings provide an opportunity for committee members to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes to the Administration regarding the draft trade agreement and implementing legislation. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in markups and reinforce congressional positions. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees conduct hearings, informal markups, and mock conferences during the trade agreement approval process to signal changes to the Administration. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress, even though a trade agreement has already been concluded. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress during the trade agreement approval process. For example, the Bush Administration declined to include a Senate Finance Committee amendment in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation, citing TPA's requirement for only necessary or appropriate legislation to be included. The Administration declined to include a Senate Finance Committee amendment in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation, citing TPA's requirement for only necessary or appropriate legislation to be included. This led to a bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the President entering into a trade agreement. Side agreements or side letters have been used in the past to address additional issues outside of formal TPA statutory requirements. The bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the President entering into a trade agreement arose due to dissatisfaction with the Oman FTA and the TPA process. Side agreements and side letters have been used in the past to address additional issues outside of formal TPA statutory requirements, with side agreements involving additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed. Side agreements and side letters are used in trade agreements to address additional issues outside of formal requirements. Side agreements involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original agreement is signed, while side letters act as clarifying devices for specific issues. Side letters are typically addressed from and to top trade negotiating representatives and are used to assuage congressional concerns. Side letters in trade agreements are clarifying devices for specific issues, typically addressed to top trade negotiating representatives. They accompany the agreement but do not change its text, requiring official signatures from all negotiating parties to be considered in force. Enforcement of side letters remains untested and unclear, with some Members of Congress relying on informal commitments to address issues raised during mock markups. Some Members of Congress rely on informal commitments from the executive branch to address issues raised in mock markups related to special interests and concerns. The Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill by addressing sugar, textile, and labor interests. TPA expired on July 1, 2007. The Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill by addressing sugar, textile, and labor interests. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and there have been criticisms of delays in requesting its renewal. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. In 2007, it was common for the President to request TPA renewal from Congress. President Obama faced criticism for delaying this request but eventually asked for TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated it in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may also want to update the 2002 law to reflect current debates and policy issues. The decision to initiate legislative action on TPA may be influenced by Congress's desire to revamp parts of the 2002 law. Some view the law as outdated and not reflecting key elements of the current debate. Technical changes and broader policy issues may be considered. It could be argued that TPA has not always operated smoothly and may not be necessary if consensus can be built on passing an FTA. When consensus exists, a 60-vote majority in the Senate is common, and the House may not need TPA for expedited legislative procedures. TPA may not be needed if consensus can be built on passing an FTA. It helps build a consensus on trade policy, signals congressional support for an FTA, and ensures Congress's role in the trade policy agenda. TPA involves more than expedited legislative procedures. It helps build consensus on trade policy, signals congressional support for FTAs, and ensures Congress's role in the trade policy agenda. Timing of TPA renewal is crucial, with suggestions to wait until negotiations for a specific FTA are near completion. The timing of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal is crucial, with suggestions to wait until negotiations for a specific Free Trade Agreement (FTA) are near completion. This would provide a compelling rationale and motivation for congressional action, allowing Congress to weigh in on critical matters early in the negotiation process. Some argue for early action on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to allow Congress to weigh in on negotiation objectives and consultation before negotiations end. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has expanded with changing trade structures, rendering previous TPA objectives outdated. The scope and content of U.S. trade negotiating objectives have expanded as trade structures have changed, rendering previous TPA objectives outdated. Current TPP negotiations include new issues such as the treatment of state-owned enterprises and regulatory cooperation. The negotiating objectives in TPA-2015 reflect new issues in current TPP negotiations, such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, trade effects on SMEs, and global supply chains. Congress should consider these new objectives in trade agreements. The implications of FTAs on global supply chains have redefined global trade. Democrats were dissatisfied with the outcome of the Trade Act of 2002, leading to a largely partisan vote on passage. Approval of FTAs was withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached by Congress. The Trade Act of 2002 led to dissatisfaction among Democrats, resulting in a largely partisan vote. Approval of FTAs was delayed until a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2007, incorporating changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments. The bipartisan \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 included significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These changes have been seen as a baseline for future trade agreements by some Republicans and Democrats. Congress may consider incorporating these commitments into formal trade negotiating objectives. House Democrats proposed key elements during the 2002 renewal debate, which have been accepted as a baseline for future trade agreements by many Republicans and Democrats. Congress may consider including these elements in formal trade negotiating objectives. Some Democrats suggest further improvements, while some Republicans have reservations about the May 10th Understanding. However, TPA-2015 includes the key provisions of the May 10th Understanding. Some Democrats and Republicans have differing views on the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and the May 10th Understanding. TPA-2015 includes key provisions from the May 10th Understanding, but there are concerns about the execution of trade negotiation consultation process. The issue has gained new attention with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the execution of trade negotiation consultation process under TPA-2015, especially regarding labor and environmental provisions. Concerns also exist about the quality of consultation during TPP negotiations. Key issues include ensuring Congress can influence FTAs early in the negotiation process and have access to draft texts of agreements. Some Members are dissatisfied with the quality of consultation during TPP negotiations. Key issues include ensuring Congress can influence FTAs early in the negotiation process and have access to draft texts of agreements. There are concerns about access to draft text for staff and Members compared to business and NGOs representatives. Some Members and staff argue for improved access to draft text during trade agreement negotiations to influence the agreement and participate in drafting implementing bills. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade partner commitments. Members of Congress, with jurisdiction over trade, emphasize the need to stay informed on trade agreement negotiations to influence the agreement text and participate in drafting implementing bills. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade partner commitments, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may also consider including language on trade agreement enforcement in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress highlighted this issue. President Obama created the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center to address trade enforcement issues. Congress may need to include language on trade agreement enforcement in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that Congress may wish to reevaluate. In the 112th Congress, technical issues with Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) were raised, prompting a need for reevaluation. Key concerns include the interpretation of using TPA only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills, with some members seeking clearer definitions for these terms. In the 112th Congress, concerns were raised about Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) being used only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills. Some members sought clearer definitions for these terms. TPA-2015 requires provisions in implementing legislation to be \"strictly necessary or appropriate,\" with debates on defining this language precisely or allowing flexibility for each Congress. Delays in introducing legislation implementing FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea were noted, taking 3-4 years after the FTAs were signed. In the 112th Congress, concerns were raised about Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) being used only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills. Some members sought clearer definitions for these terms. TPA-2015 requires provisions in implementing legislation to be \"strictly necessary or appropriate,\" with debates on defining this language precisely or allowing flexibility for each Congress. Delays in introducing legislation implementing FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea were noted, taking 3-4 years after the FTAs were signed. Some argue for a time limit on introducing an FTA implementing bill after negotiations conclude. In the 112th Congress, concerns were raised about Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) being used only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills. TPA-2015 requires provisions in implementing legislation to be \"strictly necessary or appropriate,\" with debates on defining this language precisely or allowing flexibility for each Congress. Delays in introducing legislation implementing FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea were noted, taking 3-4 years after the FTAs were signed. Congressional leveraging of FTAs for policy changes and text changes in the U.S.-South Korea FTA after negotiations raised concerns about TPA renewal addressing these issues. The U.S.-South Korea FTA underwent text changes after negotiations, potentially risking denial of approval on technical grounds. Congress may need to address this issue in TPA renewal, as the real power of TPA lies in the political compact between Congress and the President. The real power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, with an implied extension to relationships within Congress. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy to pass legislation, with TPA being a key element. Congress has options for renewing TPA authorization legislation, including renewing and revising TPA. Congress has options for renewing TPA authorization legislation, including renewing and revising TPA authority, or extending TPA for specific agreements like the TPP. Options for renewing TPA authorization legislation include renewing and revising TPA authority, extending TPA for specific agreements like the TPP, or granting the President permanent TPA authority. Representative Levin proposed a modified grant of TPA specifically for TPP negotiations during the House Ways and Means Committee markup of TPA-2015. Congress could potentially grant the President permanent fast track/TPA authority in a two-tier procedure, requiring approval before negotiations begin. The lack of TPA renewal could delay future trade agreements, but trade policy can still progress. Congress could enact permanent fast track procedures and require approval from both houses before negotiations begin. The absence of TPA renewal may delay future trade agreements, but trade policy can still move forward with other measures in place. The United States has conducted trade negotiations without TPA authority before. In the absence of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal, trade policy can still progress through other agreements like TIFAs and AGOA. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about congressional authority. Legislation to renew TPA was signed in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, legislation was signed to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with a possible three-year extension. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 expanded executive branch requirements for consultation with Congress and private sector advisers. The legislation renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with a potential three-year extension, reflecting previous TPA/fast-track authorizing legislation but with some changes. It includes sets of trade negotiating objectives and topics like trade in goods, services, foreign investment, intellectual property, transparency, regulatory practices, dispute settlement, and enforcement. The two bills renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with potential extension, including trade negotiating objectives like trade in goods, services, foreign investment, intellectual property, transparency, and more. New objectives were added for digital trade, cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, and more. The bills renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with new objectives including digital trade, cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, currency, and human rights as principal trade negotiating objectives. The bills renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for four years with new objectives including digital trade, cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, currency, and human rights as principal trade negotiating objectives. The bills also included provisions on currency and human rights as key trade negotiating objectives. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for expedited legislative procedures for the passage of trade implementing bills. Before the formal TPA procedures, mock markups are held by House and Senate committees to approve or disapprove draft legislation, providing Congress with an opportunity to express concerns. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of implementing legislation, voting to approve or disapprove. These meetings allow Congress to express concerns before the final implementing legislation is sent to Congress. The President then sends the final legal draft of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress. Before sending final implementing legislation to Congress, the Administration allows for concerns and viewpoints to be registered. The President then sends the trade agreement draft and implementing bill to Congress, which must introduce identical bills in each house and refer them to relevant committees for review within 45 days. The draft bill may reflect amendments from committees in the mock markup. Identical bills must be introduced in both houses of Congress and referred to relevant committees within 45 days. If the bill is not reported within this time frame, it is automatically discharged and placed on the calendar. If the bill is a revenue bill subject to TPA procedures, the Senate must act on the House bill. The committee has 45 days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged. If the bill is a revenue bill subject to TPA procedures, the Senate must act on it. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline for action on the bill. After the bill is reported or discharged, any Member can motion to consider it, with debate limited to 20 hours. The committee has a deadline of the 45th day of session after the bill is introduced to report it. After the bill is reported, any Member can motion to consider it with a 20-hour debate limit. The bill passes by a simple majority vote. After a bill is reported, any Member can motion to consider it with a 20-hour debate limit. The bill passes by a simple majority vote. The measure cannot be amended, and a motion to suspend this restriction is not in order. If floor action is not completed by the 15th day after the bill is reported, any Member may bring it to a vote. The House that acts second typically debates its own bill but takes a final vote on the bill received from the other House to ensure both houses act on the same measure for presentation to the President. The second house debates its own bill but takes a final vote on the bill received from the first house to ensure both houses act on the same measure for presentation to the President. The implementing bill is signed by the President and enters into force after the USTR confirms the partner country has met all obligations under the trade agreement. After the implementing bill is signed, the trade agreement enters into force for the United States when the President proclaims it, following assurance from the USTR that the partner country has fulfilled all obligations."
