The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) addresses the challenges of learning image distributions by generating images as sequences of slices and using multidimensional upscaling. It efficiently captures spatial dependencies and allows for the generation of high-quality images like CelebAHQ and ImageNet. The SPN efficiently captures image-wide spatial dependencies and uses multidimensional upscaling to grow images in size and depth. It achieves state-of-the-art likelihood results in generating CelebAHQ images of size 256 and ImageNet images from size 32 to 128, setting new benchmark results in various settings.

Autoregressive models have high fidelity and generalize well in various domains like text, audio, images, and videos. They have achieved state-of-the-art fidelity in many domains, except for unconditional large-scale image generation where long-range structure and semantic coherence are lacking. The relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity poses challenges for high-fidelity image generation. In unconditional large-scale image generation, autoregressive models struggle with long-range structure and semantic coherence. The relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity complicates high-fidelity image generation, as MLE forces the model to support the entire empirical distribution, potentially allocating capacity to irrelevant parts. In large-scale image generation, autoregressive models face challenges with long-range structure and semantic coherence. MLE forces the model to support the entire empirical distribution, which may allocate capacity to irrelevant parts. High dimensionality of large images further complicates learning dependencies among positions. The challenges in large-scale image generation include difficulties with long-range structure and semantic coherence. High dimensionality of images requires architectural connections between 196,608 positions, leading to significant memory and computation requirements. Multidimensional upscaling techniques are used to address these issues.

The goal is to learn the full distribution over 8-bit RGB images of sizes up to 256 \u00d7 256. The study focuses on upscaling a 3-bit 32 \u00d7 32 RGB subimage to an 8-bit 128 \u00d7 128 RGB image. The aim is to learn the distribution of 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size with high fidelity, emphasizing visually salient subsets of the distribution. The study aims to guide the model in focusing on visually salient subsets of the distribution by upscaling RGB images from smaller sizes to larger sizes or depths.

The study involves upscaling a 32 \u00d7 32 3-bit RGB image to a 128 \u00d7 128 8-bit RGB image by training three networks: a decoder for small size, low depth image slices, a size-upscaling decoder, and a depth-upscaling decoder. This process is illustrated in Figure 1. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture is developed to address difficulties in training decoders for size-upscaling and depth-upscaling.

Each slice is specified by its row and column offset, referred to as the \"meta-position.\" The subscale ordering captures size-only, depth-only, and multidimensional upscaling in blocks. The image can be generated according to the subscale ordering by training a single slice decoder on subimages. The subscale ordering captures size upscaling implicitly and can be performed explicitly by training a single slice decoder on subimages. The single-slice model can be trained on the first slices of images or on slices at all positions, as the SPN that captures the subscale ordering can also act as a full-blown image model and a size upscaling model simultaneously. The subscale ordering by the main network can act as a full-blown image model and a size upscaling model simultaneously. Another formulation is the Parallel Multi-Scale BID12 ordering where pixels are doubled at every stage by distinct neural networks in parallel. Multidimensional upscaling involves increasing the size of an image in height, width, and channel depth using distinct neural networks in parallel. The process is done in stages, with each network generating different bits of the image based on previously generated bits. Depth upscaling in multidimensional upscaling involves generating different bits of an image in stages using distinct neural networks. Each network generates bits based on previously generated ones, increasing the image size in height, width, and channel depth.

Mitigating memory requirements is crucial for handling larger images effectively, but this often sacrifices global context. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) addresses challenges in handling larger images effectively by embodying subscale ordering and preserving global context.

The SPN architecture uses a scaling factor to obtain slices of the original image, ensuring memory efficiency. It consists of an embedding part for preceding slices that conditions the decoder for the current slice being generated. The slices are ordered along the channel dimension with empty padding slices to preserve relative meta-positions. The neural network with residual blocks uses empty padding slices to maintain the relative meta-positions of preceding slices in the input. This ensures equivariance in the embedding architecture with respect to slice offsets. The embedding architecture maintains equivariance by aligning slices in the input and using padding slices to keep the depth consistent. It also incorporates meta-position and pixel intensity information for each target slice. The decoder in the architecture processes the target slice in raster-scan order, taking encoded representations of pixels from preceding slices as input.

The hybrid architecture combines masked convolution and self-attention. An initial 1D self-attention network gathers context in the slice before inputting it to masked 1D self-attention layers. The output is reshaped and given as conditioning input to a Gated PixelCNN for modeling the target slice with full masking. The output of the self-attention layers is reshaped and concatenated with the slice embedding network's output as conditioning input to a Gated PixelCNN. This results in significantly lower memory requirements due to the compact concatenation along the channel dimension of the input tensor. The entire previously generated context is captured at each position. The target slice is modeled with full masking over pixels and channel dimensions, resulting in significantly lower memory requirements. The log-likelihood is decomposed as a sum over slices, and maximum likelihood learning is performed through stochastic gradient descent. The log-likelihood derived from equation 2 decomposes as a sum over slices, with an unbiased estimator obtained by sampling a target slice and evaluating its logprobability conditioned on previous slices. Maximum likelihood learning is done through stochastic gradient descent on this Monte Carlo estimate, with all gradients computed by backpropagation. The SPN serves as a size-upscaling network when the input tensor's first slice is initialized with an externally generated subimage. The SPN can be used for upscaling the depth of image channels by dividing the image into slices and applying the subscale method. The smaller subimages used for initialization and training of the SPN decoder are kept identical. The SPN can upscale image channel depth by dividing the image into slices using the subscale method. The slices are concatenated along the channel dimension to create a conditioning image for the SPN. The study by van den Oord et al.

The hybrid decoder alone performs well on 32x32 Downsampled ImageNet, outperforming state-of-the-art models. However, it struggles in low-resolution settings with small image slices. On 64x64 Downsampled ImageNet, it achieves a state-of-the-art log-likelihood of 3.52 bits/dim. In low-resolution settings with S = 2 and S = 4, image quality decreases due to small image slices and coarse graining.
