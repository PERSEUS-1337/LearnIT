    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with foreign firms for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from white-collar to blue-collar occupations, raising concerns about job loss among U.S. workers. The extension of offshoring to service providers has raised concerns about job loss among U.S. workers, especially with the high unemployment rate. Despite firms moving work outside the country for decades, the labor market implications of offshore outsourcing remain unclear. The labor market implications of offshore outsourcing remain unclear among U.S. workers, with concerns raised about job loss and the high unemployment rate. Despite firms moving work outside the country for decades, the impact on job creation and economic growth is still uncertain. The impact of offshoring on job creation and economic growth remains uncertain. Some believe it contributed to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession, while others argue that the labor market eventually recovered. Offshoring may have accounted for 3% of net job loss in the early 2000s and is seen as a factor in the slow rebound from the 2007-2009 recession. Offshoring may have contributed to job loss after the 2001 recession, accounting for 3% of net job loss. Some believe it is also impacting the slow labor market rebound from the 2007-2009 recession. Despite causing dislocations for workers, economists argue that globalization benefits the nation by offering a greater variety of higher quality products at lower prices. Offshoring of service activities may benefit companies by lowering input costs, but some question if this benefits the overall economy like trade globalization does. Offshoring of service activities may benefit companies by lowering input costs, but some question if this benefits the overall economy like trade globalization does. Companies engaged in offshoring of service activities may primarily benefit themselves by increasing dividends, raising stock prices, and engaging in mergers and acquisitions instead of reinvesting in the U.S. economy. Some argue that offshoring service jobs benefits companies by reducing costs, leading to increased dividends, higher stock prices, and more mergers and acquisitions instead of reinvesting in the U.S. economy. The impact of offshoring on the labor market varies, with factory workers typically having lower education levels compared to administrative and professional workers. The offshoring of service jobs may result in college graduates facing a dwindling supply of entry-level positions traditionally serving as stepping-stones to higher skilled and higher paying jobs. This shift in job skill levels has raised concerns about the impact on the labor market. The offshoring of service jobs may lead to a decrease in entry-level positions for college graduates, raising concerns about the impact on the labor market and the ability of existing assistance programs to support well-educated workers affected by offshoring. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about the impact on the labor market and the ability of existing assistance programs to support well-educated workers affected by offshoring. Congress aims to promote U.S. job growth and assist workers who lose jobs due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. Some policymakers support measures to encourage U.S. firms to expand employment domestically. The debate surrounds job losses in the United States, whether due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. Some policymakers advocate for measures to promote domestic job growth and discourage offshoring, while others prefer limited government intervention for economic growth. Some policymakers support measures to promote domestic job growth and discourage offshoring, while others advocate for limited government intervention for economic growth. This report briefly examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies to provide context for policymakers. The report examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies and synthesizes information on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to help policymakers evaluate retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The report analyzes the impact of offshore outsourcing on U.S. employment since the early 2000s, focusing on the overseas relocation of manufacturing work by major U.S. companies in response to global economic integration. This led to the displacement of well-paid U.S. factory workers in industries like auto manufacturing. The 1970s and 1980s saw major U.S. companies moving production overseas in response to competition, outsourcing tasks to specialized domestic enterprises for efficiency, and restructuring operations by outsourcing jobs to temporary help agencies. The U.S. companies in the 1980s reacted to recessions by outsourcing activities to specialized domestic enterprises for efficiency. This led to a permanent reorganization of work processes, including outsourcing jobs to temporary help agencies and independent contractors. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to outsource jobs to temporary help agencies, professional services establishments, and independent contractors in the United States. This shift towards domestic outsourcing is a permanent reorganization of work processes, enabled by technological innovations that minimize physical distance between companies. Technologies allowing low-cost, high-quality transmission of voice and data communications have facilitated this trend. The 2001 recession led U.S. employers to utilize technological innovations for efficiency, enabling offshoring of services beyond just goods production. Jobs at risk of being offshored include software coding, credit-card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis for investors. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. firms to expand offshoring to include services beyond goods production, such as software coding, credit-card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis for investors. This shift was facilitated by advancements in communication technology and events in other countries, like addressing the Y2K crisis. The offshoring of IT services was facilitated by events like the Y2K crisis, where U.S. firms turned to companies in India for code fixes. The quality of work from these programmers was reportedly satisfactory, leading to an increase in offshoring. In response to a shortage of computer programmers in the late 1990s, U.S. firms outsourced code fixes to companies in India for the Y2K crisis. The quality of work from these programmers was satisfactory, leading to an increase in offshoring. Low-wage foreign nations also produced a surplus of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills, exceeding local needs. English became the global language of the computer industry. The educational systems of low-wage foreign nations are producing an abundance of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills, surpassing local demands. English has become the universal language of the computer industry, allowing U.S. companies to outsource tasks to non-English-speaking, low-wage countries like China, India, and Brazil. IT services can be provided from non-English-speaking, low-wage nations, allowing U.S. companies to fragment tasks across borders in manufacturing and services. This includes research, design, management, and IT support being located in different countries. Fragmentation of tasks across borders in manufacturing and services now includes intangible production tasks like research, design, management, and IT support being located in different countries. This shift has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States, with offshoring playing a significant role. Technological advancements and deunionization have also influenced wage polarization in recent decades. Offshoring has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States, while technological change and deunionization have led to wage polarization. Data on job losses due to offshoring is limited, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracking layoffs since 2004. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking job losses due to offshoring since 2004, focusing on large layoffs at firms with at least 50 employees. This data underestimates the extent of offshoring job losses, particularly in service industries. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks job losses due to offshoring since 2004, focusing on layoffs lasting 31 or more days at firms with at least 50 employees. The data underestimates offshoring job losses, especially in service industries, but consistently finds few job losses from work moving away from the United States. In the third quarter of 2012, out of over 100,000 workers laid off, less than 1,600 were let go due to work movement, representing less than 1% of the total layoffs. The BLS series has found few job losses from work moving away from the United States. In the third quarter of 2012, out of over 100,000 workers laid off, less than 1,600 were let go due to work movement, representing less than 1% of the total layoffs. Forrester Research, Inc. provided statistics on offshoring of service sector jobs. Forrester Research, Inc. forecasted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million expected to relocate outside the United States in the first 7 years. Forrester Research projected that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with half expected to relocate outside the United States in the first 7 years. This indicates a trend of increasing transfer of service activities overseas. Bhagwati et al. note that the forecasted loss of 300,000 jobs per year on average through 2015 is a small share of the jobs typically created and destroyed annually in the United States. Forrester projected 3.4 million service-sector jobs moving abroad by 2015. Bhagwati et al. noted this loss of 300,000 jobs per year is a small share of total jobs created and destroyed annually in the US. Researchers focus on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring and estimating US employment in these activities. Bardhan and Kroll estimated over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations could be offshored. Researchers have focused on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring in the United States. Bardhan and Kroll estimated that over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations could potentially be moved abroad, representing about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001. Over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, around 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, have characteristics that make them susceptible to being sent overseas. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and paralegals. The vulnerable occupational groups susceptible to offshoring in the United States include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and paralegals. They are concentrated in industries such as information, finance, insurance, and professional services. A study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas would be offshored between 2004 and 2015, with minimal impact on employment. Five metro areas may experience slightly higher job losses. The study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas would be offshored between 2004 and 2015, with minimal impact on employment. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, may experience slightly higher job losses. The study projected that certain metropolitan areas, including Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, may lose more jobs by 2015 due to offshoring. Vulnerable areas tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. The study projected that certain metropolitan areas, including Dallas, TX; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington, DC, in the Northeast and West, with high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs, may lose more jobs by 2015 due to offshoring. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. About 9.4% of total jobs are offshorable. In 2000, Jensen and Kletzer estimated that 9.4% of total U.S. employment was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services being particularly vulnerable to offshoring. Manufacturing had over 12% of employment at risk, while professional services had almost 14%. In 2000, Jensen and Kletzer estimated that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services having above-average vulnerability to offshoring. Manufacturing had over 12% of employment at risk, while professional services had almost 14%. Jensen and Kletzer later ranked 457 service occupations based on their vulnerability to being offshored by examining task content. Jensen and Kletzer examined 457 service occupations to rank their vulnerability to offshoring based on task content. They considered factors like face-to-face contact, telecommuting, IT-enabled work, and routine vs. complex activities. Occupations in computer/mathematical, architecture/engineering, legal, sciences, business/financial operations were found to have a large share of employment in the most offshorable category. Jensen and Kletzer identified occupational groups like computer/mathematical, architecture/engineering, legal, sciences, business/financial operations, and office/administrative support as having a large share of employment in offshorable categories. In 2005, these categories accounted for 27.4% of all service occupations. They also found that the offshorability of a service occupation was linked to its level of educational attainment. In 2005, Jensen and Kletzer identified offshorable occupational groups like computer/mathematical, architecture/engineering, legal, sciences, business/financial operations, and office/administrative support, which accounted for 27.4% of all service occupations. They found that service occupations with a higher percentage of bachelor's degree holders were more vulnerable to offshoring. BLS estimated that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, with over half in professional fields. Occupations with a higher percentage of bachelor's degree holders are more vulnerable to offshoring. BLS found that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, with over half in professional fields like computer and mathematical science. In 2007, these offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment. In 2007, there were 30 million jobs in 160 offshorable service-providing occupations, accounting for over one-fifth of total employment. Despite vulnerability to offshoring, these occupations saw slightly faster employment growth and greater wage growth between 2001 and 2007. In the 2001-2007 period, employment in offshorable occupations grew faster than overall service-providing employment, with comparatively greater wage growth. However, the 33 most vulnerable service-providing occupations to offshoring experienced below-average employment and wage growth. These vulnerable occupations range from office and administrative support to professional and related occupations. During the period, offshoring led to below-average employment and wage growth for vulnerable occupations. These occupations include office and administrative support roles with low education requirements and professional roles with higher educational requirements. Blinder created an index of offshorability for various occupations based on the level of personal interaction required. Blinder created an index of offshorability for various occupations, including computer operators, programmers, and support specialists, based on personal interaction requirements. He estimated that a majority of occupations are non-offshorable, while a minority are susceptible to offshoring. Blinder estimated that a majority of U.S. occupations and workers are non offshorable, while a minority fall into highly offshorable and offshorable categories. He considered the estimate too conservative due to expected technological advances. Blinder estimated that almost 30 million U.S. workers fall in offshorable categories, with a moderate estimate totaling 25.6% of all workers and an aggressive estimate totaling almost 40 million workers or 29.0% of all U.S. jobs. Contrary to conventional wisdom, offshorable occupations are not low-end jobs. Blinder estimated that around 30 million U.S. workers, or 25.6% of all workers, are susceptible to offshoring. His aggressive estimate includes nearly 40 million workers, accounting for 29.0% of all U.S. jobs. Contrary to common belief, offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs, with little correlation between skill level and offshorability. This challenges previous research findings by Jensen and Kletzer. The correlation between skill and offshorability is almost zero, challenging previous research findings by Jensen and Kletzer. Blinder and Krueger found that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable. Blinder and Krueger used three survey methods to determine offshorability of U.S. jobs. About one in four jobs are potentially offshorable, especially in factory and administrative support occupations, and industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Blinder and Krueger's analysis suggests that offshorability is prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, as well as in industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Some believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated, with only a fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes being realized by 2006. Executives may need to learn how to effectively utilize offshore talent to boost productivity.

Executives need to learn how to use offshore talent effectively to boost productivity. The management challenge will become more urgent as global salaries rise, reducing the cost benefits of outsourcing. Deloitte Consulting predicts outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail\" and companies will not outsource simply because it is trendy. The management challenge will become more urgent as global salaries rise, diminishing cost benefits from offshore outsourcing. Deloitte Consulting predicts outsourcing will no longer be a trend, with companies focusing on retaining core functions in-house for knowledge and control. Some organizations may only outsource short-term, while others will re-insource on a large scale. Some organizations will not outsource to follow the latest management trend. They will define core functions to keep in-house for knowledge and control. Dell returned help services to the US due to customer dissatisfaction, leading to a trend of re-insourcing. Other firms are also bringing back IT services and call center operations. Some U.S. firms are re-insourcing IT services, call center operations, and manufacturing back to the United States, citing customer dissatisfaction and the need for control. This trend of \"reshoring\" has contributed to the employment rebound in the manufacturing sector since the recession. Some U.S. firms are relocating IT services, call center operations, and manufacturing back to the United States from overseas due to various factors such as customer dissatisfaction, control issues, and cost advantages. This trend, known as \"reshoring,\" has helped boost employment in the manufacturing sector post-recession. China's diminishing wage and cost advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns are some of the reasons cited for this shift. Some U.S. firms have brought production back from overseas to the United States due to factors like China's shrinking manufacturing wage and cost advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Examples of companies that have reshored production include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives. Despite this trend, three factors that could have slowed offshoring in the past did not do so. Perry provided examples of companies that have brought production back to the United States, such as Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives. Despite concerns about security after 9/11, offshore providers of IT services were able to allay fears and U.S. airline carriers continued outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas. Offshore providers of IT services were able to address U.S. firms' security concerns post-9/11. U.S. airline carriers have increased outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas, even for domestic routes. Concerns have also been raised over unrest in certain regions, prompting global software service providers to distribute work across multiple countries. The Dominican Republic is a popular destination for international aircraft, including domestic routes. U.S. outsourcers have concerns about unrest in regions like India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Global software service providers are diversifying their client work across countries, including Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer moving work to Canada due to fewer cultural differences with the U.S., reducing potential customer backlash against offshoring. Despite rising labor costs in countries like India, U.S. jobs continue to be outsourced to nations with lower wages such as Vietnam. There is no comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing. Despite rising labor costs in countries like India, U.S. jobs are still being outsourced to nations with lower wages like Vietnam. There is a lack of comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing, with empirical analyses focusing on jobs susceptible to movement abroad. This approach may overstate job losses as it doesn't consider all factors influencing employers' decisions on work location."
