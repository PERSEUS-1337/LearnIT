    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of the Act. The Congress recognizes the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding entry-level jobs leading to permanent employment. It is believed that exchanging AFDC payments for work would have greater economic value than traditional welfare programs. Exchanging AFDC payments for work can provide permanent employment to recipients, maximizing economic value and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency. Workfare programs are not a substitute for private sector experience that leads to gainful employment. To break the cycle of welfare dependency, maximize economic value, and promote permanent employment, a one-year tax credit should be given to businesses for hiring AFDC recipients. SEC. 3.
