Both the House and the Senate have held hearings on natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. This report highlights global natural gas markets, supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is seen as a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. Some U.S. statutes related to natural gas can be found in Appendix G. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. It emits less carbon dioxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides than coal or oil. The United States has seen developments in natural gas usage in recent years. The United States has become a leader in the shale gas revolution, with improved extraction methods significantly increasing the country's natural gas resources. This has prompted other nations to explore shale gas development, although progress outside of North America has been slow. The United States has become a leader in the shale gas revolution, with improved extraction methods significantly increasing the country's natural gas resources. Other countries are trying to develop shale gas, but progress is slow outside of North America. The United States started exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2016, and if they and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market at a competitive price, natural gas could play a larger role in the world's economy. Several key factors will determine whether significant new quantities of natural gas come to market. If the United States and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market at a competitive price, natural gas could play a larger role in the world's economy. Factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations will determine the development of unconventional natural gas resources. Many countries are closely monitoring the evolution of U.S. unconventional natural gas resources, indicating a potential increase in the global role of natural gas. The development of unconventional natural gas resources, driven by factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations, is being closely watched by many countries. With new quantities of natural gas coming to market, natural gas is expected to have a greater role in the world energy mix due to its growing resource base and lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels.

In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, with LNG accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Countries are expanding their LNG export capacity in response to the growing demand. Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016. The United States shifted focus from importing LNG to exporting due to abundant domestic natural gas. The United States shifted focus from importing LNG to exporting due to abundant domestic natural gas, leading to the modification and expansion of existing LNG terminals for increased export capacity. This transition in the U.S. natural gas market is driven by technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling that have boosted domestic gas supply. The push for modification and expansion of existing LNG terminals in the U.S. aims to increase export capacity, requiring authorization from the Department of Energy and FERC. The natural gas market is transitioning due to technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, which have expanded domestic supply and made shale gas economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions with unconventional gas resources. The expansion of domestic natural gas supply through drilling has enabled the development of unconventional resources like shale gas. Improved efficiency has lowered production costs, making shale gas economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast, impacting natural gas transportation. The Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast have become significant shale resources, impacting natural gas transportation by reducing the need for gas from other regions. Increased production from these basins has led to lower prices and decreased imports from Canada and elsewhere. Future production is expected to rise from various shale plays including Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Anadarko, Utica, and Haynesville Basins. The decrease in demand for natural gas from the Rockies and Gulf Coast, along with increased production from shale plays like Marcellus, has led to lower prices and reduced imports from Canada. The United States is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas by 2017, with the first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurring in February 2016. The United States has transitioned from a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017, with the first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurring in February 2016. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, reducing transit time from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Asian markets for potential U.S. LNG shipments. However, only 10% of LNG carriers can fit the canal.

The development in U.S. natural gas supply raises questions about its impact on domestic gas prices, economy, shale gas resources, and environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing. The use and disposition of water in the industry process of hydraulic fracturing is a major concern for companies and regulators as U.S. natural gas production grows. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a study in 2010 to assess any impact on drinking water quality and quantity near hydraulic fracturing sites. The use and disposal of water in hydraulic fracturing raise concerns for companies and regulators. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated a study in 2010 to evaluate the impact on drinking water quality near fracking sites. Concerns include competition for water, wastewater disposal, deep-well injection, and human-caused earthquakes. The study on hydraulic fracturing's impact on drinking water is ongoing, with concerns over deep-well injection and human-induced earthquakes. Wastewater from drilling is disposed through deep-well injection, potentially linked to increased earthquakes. Emissions from the natural gas sector, particularly methane, also raise health concerns. Deep-well injection of wastewater from drilling may be linked to human-induced earthquakes. Concerns also exist regarding methane emissions from the natural gas sector, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas and precursor to smog. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions, with updates made in 2016. In 2012, the EPA established national air standards to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions in the natural gas sector. The standards were updated in 2016 to include additional equipment in the gas production chain, such as natural gas well sites, processing plants, and compressor stations. Federal standards for methane emissions do not cover all sources of methane, like offshore sources or coalbed methane production facilities. The EPA updated the 2012 NSPS to include more equipment in the gas production chain, covering natural gas well sites, processing plants, and compressor stations. However, federal methane emission standards do not include all sources like offshore and coalbed methane facilities. With the increasing production of natural gas in the US, methane pollution is a significant concern for policymakers.

Around 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, with global LNG trade increasing by 1.8% in 2015. LNG transportation provides flexibility in the final destination, with pipelines and tankers being the primary methods. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Natural gas is primarily transported by pipelines or as a liquid in tankers, providing flexibility in the final destination. U.S. LNG exports have influenced other countries to delink their gas exports from oil-indexed prices. Most international natural gas trade occurs under long-term contracts. Global gas trade was 33%, with most international natural gas trade occurring under long-term contracts, usually 20 years in length. LNG consumers sometimes do not require the entire amount of natural gas in their contracts, allowing producers to sell the excess. \"Natural gas trade internationally is primarily done under long-term contracts, typically 20 years in length, whether by pipeline or LNG. This is due to the high cost of transportation and the need for long-term contracts to finance transport facilities. Excess natural gas not needed by LNG consumers can be sold on the spot market. Russia, the largest natural gas exporter, uses its pipeline network to Europe and opened an LNG export terminal in 2009 targeting the Asian market for flexibility.\" The spot market for natural gas is growing, with LNG producers selling excess to other consumers on a short-term basis. Russia, the world's largest natural gas exporter, opened its first LNG export terminal in 2009 targeting the Asian market. Qatar is the leading exporter of LNG, with Europe being the largest importing region primarily from Russia, Norway, and Algeria. Qatar is the top LNG exporter, supplying 31% of global trade to Asia and Europe. Europe imports gas mainly from Russia, Norway, and Algeria, seeking more secure sources due to Russia-Ukraine tensions. Asia relies heavily on LNG, but China is increasing pipeline imports from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan, with China being Turkmenistan's main gas importer. The European Union is considering more secure natural gas sources due to tensions between Russia and Ukraine. China has become increasingly reliant on imported gas via pipelines from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan, with over 70% of Turkmenistan's exports going to China in 2015. The United States and Canada have a well-integrated pipeline system, with Mexico and Canada being the main recipients of U.S. natural gas by pipeline. Export projections show an increase in exports to Mexico and a slight rise in exports to Canada by 2040. In 2015, over 70% of Turkmenistan's exports went to China. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico and Canada as main recipients of U.S. natural gas. Export projections show an increase in exports to Mexico and a slight rise in exports to Canada by 2040. U.S. LNG prices are market-based, creating an economic incentive for domestic gas exports. The first U.S. LNG cargo was shipped to Brazil from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana in February 2016. The export of U.S. LNG has been a topic of debate among policymakers, with questions about its impact on the global market, geopolitics, and domestic prices. As of April 2016, there is one LNG export terminal in operation and several under construction in the lower-48 states. The U.S. LNG export terminal in Louisiana is a key point of debate among policymakers regarding its impact on the global market, geopolitics, and domestic prices. Several LNG export terminal projects are under construction in the lower-48 states, including Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Dominion-Cove Point LNG, Cameron LNG, Freeport LNG Expansion, and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG. Additionally, the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska, operational since 1969, continues to operate. Several LNG \"trains\" are under construction in the lower-48 states, including Sabine Pass Liquefaction in Sabine, LA; Dominion-Cove Point LNG in Cove Point, MD; Cameron LNG in Hackberry, LA; Freeport LNG Expansion/FLNG Liquefaction in Freeport, TX; and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG in Corpus Christi, TX. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska, operational since 1969, continues to supply LNG to Japan. In February 2016, the United States started shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami, FL in cryogenic containers instead of specialized tanker ships. In 2016, the United States began shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers instead of specialized tanker ships. The natural gas from these shipments has been sold at a higher price than exports from Sabine Pass, ranging from $10 to almost $16 per MBtus. Additionally, in 2014, a small amount of LNG was shipped to Honolulu, HI from Alaska, marking the state's first shipment. Alaska has the potential to become a major source of natural gas. Alaska has great potential to become a major source of natural gas, with estimates that conventional resources on the North Slope may exceed 200,000 bcf. However, most gas produced in Alaska is used for oil production and not brought to market. The USGS estimates that Alaska's North Slope has over 200,000 bcf of natural gas, but most of it is used for oil production. Alaskan officials want to sell gas internationally as LNG, but face commercial challenges. In 2016, the TPP FTA was signed between the US and several countries. Alaskan officials aim to sell natural gas internationally as LNG, facing commercial challenges. The TPP FTA signed in 2016 may impact U.S. natural gas trade by expediting permits for exports to FTA countries, granting free trade status to key LNG consumers. The TPP and TTIP trade agreements could impact U.S. natural gas trade by granting free trade status to key consumers of LNG. The TTIP aims to promote trade and economic growth between the U.S. and the EU through market access, regulation, and cooperation principles. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a proposed trade agreement between the United States and the EU aimed at promoting trade and economic growth. It addresses market access, regulation, and cooperation principles, including granting free trade status for natural gas. The TTIP, along with the TPP, has not been ratified. In December 2015, the Paris Agreement was established at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP-21) to address climate change and implement measures to mitigate its effects. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in April 2016 to address climate change and establish measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. U.S. infrastructure may struggle to keep up with growing gas supplies due to aging pipelines built in the 1950s and 1960s. The United States signed the Paris Agreement on April 22, 2016, to address emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. Aging gas pipelines from the 1950s and 1960s may hinder infrastructure expansion. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines could be challenging due to competing infrastructure demands. Oil prices and new infrastructure developments may impact domestic and international markets. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines may range from $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion annually between 2015 and 2030, posing challenges due to competing infrastructure demands. Factors affecting markets include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological development, interdependence between gas and electric sectors, and climate policies. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), a cartel organization based in Qatar, comprises 11 natural gas producing countries. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), known as gas OPEC, is a cartel organization based in Qatar with 11 natural gas producing countries. Together, they account for a significant portion of global natural gas reserves and trade. The GECF's ability to impact U.S. natural gas consumption is limited due to the U.S.'s substantial natural gas resource base. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), also known as gas OPEC, consists of 11 natural gas producing countries. These countries collectively hold 62% of global natural gas reserves, 57% of LNG trade, and 39% of pipeline gas trade. The U.S., with its abundant natural gas resources, is unlikely to be significantly impacted by the GECF in the near future. Canada, the largest source of imported natural gas to the U.S., is not a member of the GECF. Europe, heavily reliant on gas imports from GECF members like Russia and Algeria, may be more vulnerable to potential cartel control. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) consists of 11 natural gas producing countries holding a significant portion of global reserves. While the U.S. is unlikely to be impacted, Europe, heavily reliant on gas imports from GECF members, may be vulnerable to cartel control. However, the current market structure limits supply and price manipulation, requiring significant changes for the GECF to have influence. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015. Global natural gas production in 2015 grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. The United States surpassed Russia as the world's largest natural gas producer in 2009, leading to an evaluation of potential natural gas resources in many countries. However, significant changes would be needed in the market structure for the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) to have influence. In 2015, global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. The United States became the world's largest natural gas producer in 2009, prompting other countries to evaluate their own resources. However, most countries lack the necessary data, technology, and equipment for significant shale gas production before the end of the decade. Outside of Canada and the United States, significant commercial production of shale gas is unlikely before the end of the decade in other countries due to lack of data, technology, and equipment. Natural gas prices in the US, Canada, and the UK are market-driven, with hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA providing competitive price data. By 2040, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price in the United States is projected to rise to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) due to increased domestic demand. Interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines interconnect in the United States, with different prices for consumers. By 2040, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is expected to increase to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) due to rising demand. This projection by EIA does not consider potential market changes like new technologies or regulations. The price of natural gas is expected to increase to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) due to higher demand. EIA's projection is based on existing information and does not account for significant market changes. Natural gas is commonly sold under long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil or oil-based products. In the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, wholesale natural gas is typically sold under long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil. The disparity between contract prices and spot prices has pressured gas producers to consider incorporating spot prices for natural gas. The disparity between contract and spot prices for natural gas has pressured producers to consider incorporating spot prices into pricing formulas. Some producers have already started implementing spot prices, reflecting the regional nature of the industry. Asia, in particular, is willing to pay high prices for natural gas supplies. Take-or-pay clauses and destination clauses are also important contract concepts in the natural gas industry. Incorporating spot prices for natural gas into pricing formulas reflects the regional nature of the industry. Asia is willing to pay high prices for gas supplies. Take-or-pay clauses in contracts require buyers to pay regardless of gas receipt, typically purchasing at least 80% of the contracted volume. Take-or-pay clauses in natural gas contracts require buyers to pay for a minimum volume, even if they do not use it all. Destination clauses allow for redirection of cargo to different buyers. This contributes to a more efficient market for natural gas. The natural gas industry is facing the question of whether it should become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand for natural gas by 2040. Take-or-pay clauses in contracts require buyers to pay for a minimum volume, even if they don't use it all, while destination clauses allow for redirection of cargo to different buyers, making the market more efficient. The natural gas industry is facing the question of whether it should become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand for natural gas by 2040, with most of the new demand coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. As North America continues to produce unconventional gas, the global energy landscape is shifting towards natural gas as a major alternative for decarbonizing the energy system. China's shift towards a services-focused economy may reduce future energy demand by 85%, impacting global energy trends. China's transition to a services-focused economy could lead to an 85% reduction in future energy demand, impacting global energy trends. India is expected to significantly increase global energy demand by 2040, with natural gas accounting for 6% of its energy supply. Meeting India's energy needs may require a substantial financial commitment of nearly $2.8 trillion. China's future in energy consumption is uncertain. India is projected to contribute significantly to global energy demand by 2040, with natural gas making up a small portion of its energy mix. The U.S. electric power industry leads the growth in natural gas demand due to various factors. Natural gas currently accounts for 6% of India's primary energy supply and is expected to make up less than 10% of the country's energy mix by 2040. The U.S. electric power industry is driving the growth in natural gas demand due to factors like low prices, lower capital costs, and competitive financing. Government policies on carbon dioxide emissions will play a crucial role in determining the rate of natural gas usage growth. Globally, natural gas is projected to make up 28% of total world electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries accounting for 61% of this demand. Production of natural gas will need to increase to meet rising demand and stabilize prices. Government policies, especially regarding carbon dioxide emissions, will significantly impact the growth of natural gas usage. Globally, natural gas is projected to make up 28% of total world electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries accounting for 61% of this demand. Production of natural gas will need to increase to meet rising demand and prevent price spikes, with unconventional gas resources playing a key role in supply growth. Global natural gas production and growth is projected to increase to meet rising demand and prevent price spikes, with unconventional gas resources accounting for about 60% of supply growth. However, outside of North America, unconventional resource development is slower and uneven. China's policies encourage production, but limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas may hinder full capacity realization.
