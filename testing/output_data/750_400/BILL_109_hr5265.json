The Act titled the \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\" acknowledges the devastating impact of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Southeast Asia, highlighting the potential risk of a similar event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone on the west coast of the United States in the next 50 years. Scientists predict a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major seismic event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone in the next 50 years, which could cause a large earthquake and tsunami, leading to significant damage to infrastructure and emergency services. Recent false alarms have revealed that coastal communities are unprepared for such an event. The purpose and goals of the document are outlined in Section 3. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) provides one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program aims to assist departments lacking resources in tsunami preparedness, mitigation, and response to protect public health and safety. The program aims to support emergency management departments in improving tsunami warning systems and response capabilities to protect public health and safety. The grant program aims to support emergency management departments in improving tsunami warning systems and response capabilities to protect public health and safety. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to certain areas to prepare for tsunamis, prioritizing areas with a 10 percent or greater likelihood of a tsunami in the next 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency service providers. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds to establish warning systems, purchase rescue equipment, and reinforce critical service buildings and facilities. This includes sirens, weather radios, communication gear, reverse 911 systems, police and fire stations, and emergency management facilities. The grant funds can be used for various purposes such as establishing warning systems, purchasing rescue equipment, reinforcing critical service buildings and facilities like police stations, fire stations, hospitals, shelters, and sewer sanitation systems. Additionally, funds can be allocated for post-tsunami shelters, supplies, and outreach programs for educating residents and tourists about different types of tsunamis. The grant funds can be used for establishing warning systems, purchasing rescue equipment, reinforcing critical service buildings, post-tsunami shelters and supplies, and developing outreach programs to educate residents and tourists about different types of tsunamis. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes must contribute a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds. Emergency management departments serving areas with populations between 20,001 and 50,000 must contribute 10% of the project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for a grant under this Act. For areas with populations under 20,000, the contribution required is 5% of the total project cost. (c) Population Under 20,000.--Emergency management departments in areas with populations under 20,000 must provide 5% of the project cost with non-Federal funds to qualify for a grant under this Act. In-kind contributions can also be considered, not exceeding 50% of the department's non-Federal fund contribution. The Director will evaluate emergency management departments that received grants under this Act for tsunami readiness and effectiveness of programs. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" refers to an agency responsible for planning and managing emergencies within a community. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states.
