Focus on only one stage in the building's life cycle can lead to savings at that stage but losses at another. In building renovations, prioritizing certain elements due to constraints or occupant priorities is important. Focusing on only one stage in the building's life cycle can lead to savings at that stage but losses at another. For example, the choice of building materials may have environmental impacts that are not immediately apparent. In building renovations, prioritizing certain elements is crucial. Focusing on one stage can lead to savings but losses at another. For instance, the environmental impacts of alternative building materials may not be immediately apparent. Concrete walls offer better insulation than wood but have higher carbon dioxide emissions. Energy usage during building operation surpasses that of construction, so choices made during construction should consider postoccupancy planning. A green building approach helps assess the impact of actions at different stages. A green building approach can reduce problems by assessing the impact of actions at different stages. Choices made during construction should consider postoccupancy planning, as energy usage during building operation surpasses that of construction. For example, using environmentally preferable products can affect occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy generation can help buildings function during power outages. Formal systems and tools have been developed to set criteria for green and sustainable buildings, assessing whether projects meet those criteria. On-site renewable energy and stormwater management can enhance building resilience and ecological services. Formal systems and tools have been developed over the last few decades to set criteria for green and sustainable buildings. These systems fall into categories such as rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Determining whether a building is green or sustainable is complex, with no simple metric available. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices and raise public awareness. The term rating system is often used interchangeably with certification system, although they refer to somewhat different concepts. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems like LEED to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points to buildings for meeting green design criteria, resulting in an overall score and tier ranking.

Building codes are often mandatory, while standards may be incorporated into laws. This section focuses on comprehensive green building codes and standards that cover various elements, excluding energy efficiency. Building codes specify minimum requirements for building design and construction, covering various aspects from aesthetics to resource use. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes. Green building codes specify minimum requirements for building design and construction, covering aspects beyond health and safety, such as aesthetics and resource use. State and local governments adopt or modify national model codes for regulating buildings within their jurisdictions. Green building codes go beyond minimum requirements for building design and construction, with state and local governments adopting national model codes. These codes can include additional environmental design and performance standards, exceeding basic building code requirements. Green building codes, also known as \"beyond-code\" or \"above-code\" options, exceed minimum building code requirements and can be mandatory or voluntary measures for meeting green building objectives. They incorporate technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations (SDOs). Adopting green building model codes can be mandatory or voluntary for meeting green building objectives. These codes often include technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations. Some organizations have used the standards-development process to establish general green building standards. The Whole Building Design Guide defines a standard as a set of guidelines and criteria for judging a product's compliance. Buildings meeting a specific standard may be certified as having met the criteria. Some organizations have utilized the standards-development process to create general green building standards.

New institutional construction, driven by certification requirements, is expected to fuel future growth in green building. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is also increasing among existing buildings. In the United States, institutional construction is projected to drive green building growth due to certification requirements for public buildings and schools. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is increasing, with a rise in office space certified by LEED or Energy Star from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016 for the 30 largest U.S. office markets. However, a significant portion of residential and commercial buildings still need retrofitting or replacement to meet green building criteria. The Adoption Index reports a significant increase in the percentage of office space certified by LEED or Energy Star, from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016 for the 30 largest U.S. office markets. However, there is still a large portion of U.S. buildings that do not meet green building criteria, making rapid retrofitting or replacement challenging. Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance through construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The costs of implementing green building measures strongly influence design and construction decisions. The financial impact of green building efforts on a building includes initial construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The costs of implementing green building measures influence design and construction decisions, but obtaining accurate cost information can be challenging. Researchers note that the flexibility in designing green buildings makes it difficult to generalize about their cost performance. The financial impact of green building efforts includes initial construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. Obtaining accurate cost information can be challenging, leading to distorted perceptions about the economic benefits of green building. Generalizing about the cost performance of green buildings as a whole is difficult due to their design flexibility. Initial costs of green buildings are believed to be higher than conventional buildings. The initial costs of green buildings are believed to be higher than conventional buildings, which is a top obstacle for green building in the United States. Higher costs can stem from features like high-efficiency appliances and design costs, making the financial performance of green building investments limited. Perceived initial cost is a top obstacle for green building in the United States. Higher costs can result from features like high-efficiency appliances and design costs, but evidence suggests that construction costs for green buildings are comparable to standard construction. The process of certifying green buildings may be time-consuming and expensive, but evidence shows that construction costs are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design can lead to initial cost reductions, and operational cost savings over time can offset any higher investment. Green buildings aim for cost parity with conventional buildings. Integrated design can lower initial costs, and operational savings over time can offset higher investments. Green buildings reduce utility usage and can sell renewable energy back to the grid, leading to significant savings. GSA saved $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements between FY2008 and FY2015. Multiple studies support the link between green certification and cost savings. Green certification can lead to operational cost savings by reducing utility resource usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid. GSA saved over $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements between FY2008 and FY2015. Studies show that green certification is linked to reduced utility expenses, but its impact on overall operating expenses is mixed. Green-labeled buildings may also command price premiums. Green certification is associated with reduced utility expenses, but its impact on overall operating expenses is mixed. Green-labeled buildings may command price premiums in the real estate market. Buildings command price premiums on the real estate market, with renters willing to pay more for the space. However, some factors can reduce incentives for investments in green building, especially for building owners who may move frequently. The financial return on green building investments depends on the premium owners can charge tenants. Investments in green building can lead to reduced time for return on initial investment through potential utility savings. The financial return for owners depends on the premium they can charge tenants, while tenants' return relies on their tenure length. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations. The financial return for owners of green building investments depends on the premium they can charge tenants, while tenants' return relies on their tenure length. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations, especially for significant energy users like educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers to green building may decrease as the practice becomes more widespread and economies of scale lower the initial cost differential. Cost barriers to green building may decrease as the practice becomes more widespread and economies of scale lower the initial cost differential. Financial incentives offered by some states and municipalities can help defray higher initial costs, making green building investments more financially attractive. Observers argue that costs beyond monetary expenditures should be considered, leading to concepts like the \"triple bottom line\" in green building literature. Cost barriers to green building may decrease as the practice becomes more widespread and economies of scale lower the initial cost differential. Financial incentives from states and municipalities can help defray higher initial costs, making green building investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept includes social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones when assessing business performance. Green building efforts need to distinguish between design and performance, with a focus on design in rating systems like LEED. The \"triple bottom line\" concept in green building includes social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones. Evaluating green building efforts requires distinguishing between design and performance, with a historical focus on design specifications. Actual environmental performance of green buildings was not initially incorporated into certification requirements for rating systems like LEED, leading to potential degradation of building performance post-certification. The focus of green building certification systems like LEED has historically been on design and construction specifications. However, the actual environmental performance of green buildings post-certification can be affected by factors such as inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use. As a result, there is uncertainty whether a nominally green building will perform significantly better or worse than a conventional building. Certified green buildings may not always perform better than conventional buildings due to factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use. Actual green building performance studies are discussed later in this section, showing that even when resource-use efficiency is improved, savings may be offset by other factors. Studies have shown that certified green buildings may not always outperform conventional buildings, as post-occupancy resource-intensive issues can arise. Green building efforts have helped reduce energy-use intensity in newer U.S. homes, but their larger size and increased use of electronic devices result in higher total energy consumption. Green building efforts have reduced energy-use intensity in newer U.S. homes, but their larger size and increased use of electronic devices result in higher total energy consumption. There is a significant difference between predicted and actual energy use in green buildings, known as a \"performance gap,\" which is a topic of ongoing concern in construction. The energy performance of green buildings has a significant difference between predicted and actual energy use, known as a \"performance gap.\" Closing this gap is a concern in the construction industry, leading to an emphasis on postoccupancy performance assessment in rating systems like LEED. Recent revisions require the installation of building-level energy and water meters to address critiques about one-time certification assessments. Recent revisions of green building rating systems, such as LEED, now emphasize postoccupancy performance assessment by requiring building-level energy and water meters to be installed. This data must be reported to USGBC for the first five years after certification. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification also include performance parameters in their criteria. Building codes are aligning with these changes. Building-level energy and water meters are required for postoccupancy performance assessment in green building rating systems like LEED. Data from these meters must be reported to USGBC for the first five years after certification. Other certification systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification, also incorporate performance parameters. Building codes are evolving to include outcome-based compliance pathways for energy usage. Commissioning of building systems ensures they are designed, installed, tested, and operable. Building codes are moving towards outcome-based compliance pathways for energy usage, with the 2015 IgCC allowing builders to meet requirements through actual performance. Commissioning of building systems ensures they are designed, installed, tested, and capable of being operated as planned, improving environmental performance, especially for energy use. Commissioning can be applied to new and existing buildings during retrofitting or ongoing operations. Commissioning of building systems ensures they are designed, installed, and tested as planned, improving environmental performance, especially for energy use. It can be applied to new and existing buildings during retrofitting or ongoing operations. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards for certification, which includes commitments to conform to environmental requirements, improve performance, and prevent pollution. An organization can develop an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards for certification. The EMS must include commitments to conform to environmental requirements, improve performance, prevent pollution, and include performance measurement for easier compliance. Networked building monitoring tools are increasingly used for early fault detection and resource use analytics for building managers. Networked building monitoring tools, like GSAlink, can detect equipment faults and optimize performance. Performance measurement in EMS aids in meeting environmental commitments and preventing pollution. Green building studies evaluate resource use patterns for effective response. GSAlink, a building diagnostic tool, has identified over 33,000 instances of sub-optimal equipment performance within GSA holdings. Studies on green building performance show mixed results due to a lack of consensus on defining criteria and outcomes. Studies on green building performance have shown mixed results due to a lack of consensus on defining criteria and outcomes. Recent research has found that green buildings exhibit a wide range of energy performance, with some falling below design expectations. The selected studies primarily use LEED ratings for inclusion, as other rating systems are less common in the United States. Green buildings have shown varied energy performance, with some performing below design expectations. Studies primarily use LEED ratings for inclusion, as other systems are less common in the US. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings found they performed 24% better on average, but about one in seven performed worse. This study was criticized for sample bias and inappropriate baselines. A study of energy use by over 100 LEED-certified buildings in the U.S. market showed that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings. However, about one in seven buildings performed worse than average. Criticisms of the study included sample bias and inappropriate baselines for comparison. Another assessment using the same data found that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A follow-up assessment using the same data concluded that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which had received LEED certification, found that, on average, the buildings studied performed better than the national average in all measured performance areas, including energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. Some buildings performed worse than the national average in certain areas. The buildings studied performed better than the national average in all measured performance areas, including energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. However, some buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements and consumed more electricity than the national average. The Navy buildings and Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements and consumed more electricity than the national average, indicating a performance gap with LEED certification. The majority of the sample underperformed both the design and baseline energy-use simulations, indicating a disconnection between strategies employed and modeling results. Studies do not provide sufficient evidence that LEED certification consistently reduces building energy consumption due to small sample sizes and limited access to performance data. The discussion highlights the importance of performance measurement in ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and improving them. Limited access to building performance data hinders comprehensive assessments, with methods for measuring green building performance still underdeveloped. Building performance data is crucial for assessing green buildings and improving their environmental targets. Methods for measuring performance are still underdeveloped, with some elements easy to quantify while others may require qualitative measures. The measurement methods for green buildings are not well-developed, with some elements easy to quantify while others may require qualitative measures. Disagreements may arise on the most relevant metrics, such as energy use intensity (EUI) per square foot. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI) in federal buildings, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. This can lead to varying energy use patterns depending on the metric used. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI) in federal buildings, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. A study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory cautioned that a lack of accurate building occupancy data could complicate efforts to calculate occupancy-adjusted EUI. Additionally, commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with intended outcomes. The study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory warned that inaccurate building occupancy data could complicate efforts to calculate occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be strongly correlated with intended outcomes, indicating the importance of regular performance measurement over a building's lifespan to prevent environmental deterioration. The importance of regular performance measurement over a building's lifespan is emphasized to prevent environmental deterioration. Federal agencies are required by EISA to measure their buildings' performance against specified targets, particularly in energy use, with more stringent targets for new construction. Life-cycle assessment for whole buildings may become feasible in the future. The EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance against energy targets, with stricter goals for new construction. Challenges exist in accurately determining baseline energy consumption levels. Despite available resources, uncertainties and gaps make effective application challenging. The accurate baseline for measuring energy consumption levels in green building is challenging due to uncertainties and gaps in data availability. Consensus on specific measurement goals and metrics may not exist, making reliable and consistent data difficult to obtain. Measurement science in green building is an active area of research, with the development of appropriate measurement science identified as a top research need for progress in green building. The development of appropriate measurement science for green building is a top research need. Reliable data is challenging to obtain, and agency progress towards green building goals varies widely. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies widely. In the Obama Administration, OMB released annual sustainability and energy scorecards for each agency, reporting on progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. The Obama Administration released annual energy scorecards for agencies with sustainability reporting requirements. Scorecards tracked progress in areas like GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings, using numeric reports and color scores to indicate performance. A green score signified meeting or being on track to meet targets. The Obama Administration released annual energy scorecards for agencies with sustainability reporting requirements, tracking progress in areas like GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. Scorecards included numeric reports and color scores (green, yellow, red) to indicate agency progress towards targets. Green indicated meeting or being on track, yellow showed some progress, and red meant neither on track nor significant progress. Federal progress towards three buildings-related goals is discussed, with detailed agency progress in Table 2. The Obama Administration released annual energy scorecards for agencies with sustainability reporting requirements, tracking progress in areas like GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. Scorecards included color scores (green, yellow, red) to indicate agency progress towards targets. Green indicated meeting or being on track, yellow showed some progress, and red meant neither on track nor significant progress. Federal progress towards three buildings-related goals is discussed below. Some agencies have already surpassed the green building goal of ensuring 15% compliance with Guiding Principles by FY2025. Some agencies have surpassed the green building goal of 15% compliance with Guiding Principles by FY2025, while others are making progress. However, a few agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings. Many agencies did not meet the Energy Intensity Goal of reducing energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015. Government-wide energy intensity only declined by 22% during this period. Several agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings. Energy Intensity Goal: EISA set a goal for federal facilities to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015, but many agencies did not meet this goal. Government-wide energy intensity declined only 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015. Potable Water Intensity Goal: E.O. 13514 set a goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity between 2007 and 2020, which was replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015 with a 36% reduction from 2007 levels. Government-wide energy intensity declined only 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015. Progress on this goal will be reported starting for FY2016. E.O. 13514 set a goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity between 2007 and 2020, replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015 with a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Many agencies have already achieved the earlier goal, with several making substantive progress toward the 36% reduction required for 2025. Some agencies have achieved the earlier goal of a 26% reduction in potable water intensity by 2020. Concerns have been raised about green building certification systems and their varying levels of rigor. While green building certification systems are generally seen as a positive development, critics have raised concerns about their varying levels of rigor. Some argue that the certification process lacks consistency and fails to set caps on performance metrics, making sustainability claims relative. Others believe that the design criteria are not integrative enough across elements or stages in a building's life cycle. Additionally, some critics argue that simply mitigating environmental impacts is not enough for true sustainability. Some critics argue that green building certification systems lack consistency and fail to set caps on performance metrics, making sustainability claims relative. They believe design criteria should be more integrative across elements and stages in a building's life cycle. Additionally, there are concerns about the need for new approaches beyond mere mitigation of environmental impacts, such as maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem services. Critics suggest these approaches should extend beyond individual buildings to include other components of the built environment. Some observers worry that builders new to green building may fail to appreciate the importance of taking a forward-thinking, integrative approach to green building design. They may see green building measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. The scientific and technological knowledge base for green building is also limited. Some may view green building measures as mere add-ons rather than integral parts of a project, lacking a forward-thinking approach. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base in green building complicates the identification of appropriate approaches, necessitating further research to enhance understanding. Differences in goals and perspectives among stakeholders can further exacerbate these challenges. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base in green building complicates the identification of appropriate approaches, necessitating further research to enhance understanding. Differences in goals and perspectives among stakeholders can further exacerbate these challenges. Identifying objective criteria and approaches may be difficult, especially for elements of green building not easily quantifiable. Congress may face questions regarding green building approaches. Identifying objective criteria and approaches in green building can be challenging due to differences in goals and perspectives among stakeholders. Congress may need to address questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs and methods for coordination among agencies, as well as the extension of federal efforts to support green building measures nationwide. Congress may need to address questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs, coordination among agencies, extension of federal efforts to support green building measures nationwide, priorities for different elements of green building, and facilitating growth of scientific and technical knowledge in green building. Congress may need to address questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs, coordination among agencies, extension of federal efforts nationwide, priorities for different elements of green building, and facilitating growth of scientific and technical knowledge. GAO has released reports on federal efforts related to green building, including 94 initiatives across 11 agencies. Congress may wish to take additional action through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law to review and coordinate federal efforts relating to green building programs. GAO has identified 94 initiatives across 11 agencies, but few focus on green building in an integrative sense. Agencies are recommended to assess the relative performance of these initiatives. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified 94 initiatives across 11 agencies related to green building in the nonfederal sector. However, most initiatives focus on specific elements like energy, IEQ, or water, rather than an integrative approach. GAO recommended agencies coordinate to assess the initiatives' performance. Congress should evaluate federal agencies' implementation of green building programs and their impact on nationwide adoption of green building practices. Congress should examine how federal agencies are implementing green building programs and their impact on nationwide adoption of green building practices. It is important to assess the coordination of agency efforts and the support for energy-efficient mortgages by agencies like the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress should consider providing stronger mortgage and tax incentives, broadening the scope of incentives to include green building elements, funding the rebate program authorized by EPACT 2005, and specific appropriations to support energy-efficient mortgages. Congress could also become Energy Star partners and consider regulatory actions to speed adoption of green building, including funding the rebate program authorized by EPACT 2005 and specific appropriations for residential renovation. Congress could consider regulatory actions, such as funding rebate programs and specific appropriations, to accelerate green building adoption in areas with low market penetration, like residential renovation. Additionally, Congress could enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies and ensure integration and harmonization of activities across agencies like EPA and DOE. Congress could consider enhancing current green building efforts in federal agencies by ensuring integration and harmonization of activities across agencies like EPA and DOE, potentially through participation in the WBDG. Energy is a key focus in green building discussions due to concerns about fossil fuel imports and climate change. Among the elements of green building, energy has received the most attention in federal efforts. Congress may need to ensure a balanced approach to all components of green building to strengthen existing programs or create new ones. The text discusses the need for Congress to examine the balance of federal efforts in green building, considering elements beyond just energy. It suggests strengthening existing programs or establishing new ones to address national needs more effectively. Additionally, it proposes exploring whether the current incremental approach to green building is sufficient or if modifications or acceleration of efforts are necessary to meet national goals. Congress may need to consider strengthening existing green building programs or establishing new ones to address national needs more effectively. It is also suggested to explore if the current incremental approach is sufficient or if modifications or acceleration of efforts are necessary. R&D funding for green building from federal and private-sector sources may be suboptimal, with green building receiving less than 0.5% of total federal nondefense R&D funding in 2007. The knowledge base for green building is supported by R&D funded by federal and private-sector sources, but funding levels may be insufficient. Green building received less than 0.5% of federal nondefense R&D funding in 2007, and construction sector investment in R&D is below industry average. Funding for different elements of green building varies, with energy being a higher priority. The construction sector invests less in R&D for green building compared to the industry average. Funding for different green building elements varies, with energy being a higher priority. Congress may need to reconsider federal funding levels and priorities, and create incentives for more private-sector R&D funding. Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities to increase private-sector R&D funding for green building elements. Additionally, ensuring sufficient training and education in relevant areas of expertise is essential for a knowledgeable workforce in the construction, certification, and operation of green buildings."
