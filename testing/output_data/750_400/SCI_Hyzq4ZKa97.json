    "content": "In the design of deep neural networks, the focus has been on improving accuracy, resulting in complex architectures that are hard to deploy practically. To address this, there is a growing interest in developing quantitative metrics that go beyond accuracy alone. This study introduces NetScore, a new metric aimed at evaluating the performance of deep neural networks for on-device edge usage by considering accuracy, computational complexity, and balance. In this study, NetScore is introduced as a new metric to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage, considering accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. The NetScore metric was compared with top-1 accuracy and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks. The study compares NetScore, top-1 accuracy, and information density metrics across 60 deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset, aiming to provide a reference guide for practitioners. The study evaluates deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset, presenting results across various metrics as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. There is a growing interest in deep learning for diverse applications, but challenges remain in deploying complex neural networks in practical industrial settings. The practical challenges of deploying complex deep neural networks in industrial settings have become increasingly visible. Designing networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a key focus in current research on deep learning. The design of deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a hot area of research focus. One key challenge is assessing how well a network architecture strikes this balance. The information density metric measures the relative accuracy given network size but does not consider computational requirements for network inference. NetScore is a new metric introduced in this study to address the need for universal performance metrics that consider accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity in network model search and design. NetScore is a new metric introduced to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network performance in model search and design. The metric aims to improve the usability of network models by considering these factors. NetScore is a new metric designed to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network performance in model search and design. The study sets \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5 for evaluation of deep convolutional neural networks like AlexNet BID22. The results can serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field."
