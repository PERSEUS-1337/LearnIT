    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" and \"Federal entity.\" The Act defines key terms including \"Assistant Secretary\" as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, \"Commission\" as the Federal Communications Commission, \"Federal entity\" as defined in section 113(l) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act, \"Spectrum Relocation Fund\" as the Fund established under section 118 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act, and \"unlicensed operations\" as the use of. The Spectrum Relocation Fund is defined as the fund established under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. Unlicensed operations refer to spectrum use without exclusive rights or protection from interference under specific regulations. The Federal Communications Commission is responsible for allocating and allotting spectrum. The Commission must balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations. Within 18 months of this Act, rules must be established to achieve this balance in future radio frequency band assignments. Consideration will also be given to permitting unlicensed operations. The Commission must establish rules within 18 months of this Act to balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in future radio frequency band assignments. Consideration will be given to permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum assigned by auction until the licensee initiates commercial service. These rules must be included in the service rules of an auction for spectrum. The Commission must establish rules within 18 months to balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in future radio frequency band assignments. Consideration will be given to permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum assigned by auction until the licensee initiates commercial service. The Commission shall include these rules in the service rules of an auction for spectrum and ensure that reports to Congress reflect the rulemaking required. The National Strategy for Unlicensed Spectrum is outlined in Section 4. The policy of the United States is to maximize spectrum resources, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission must develop a national strategy for making more radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations within a year of this Act's enactment. The Commission, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary, must develop a national strategy within a year of this Act's enactment for making additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations. This strategy will include identifying proposed bands to be cleared for unlicensed use and ensuring a balanced approach. The strategy developed under subsection (b) shall include identification of proposed radio frequency bands to be cleared for unlicensed operations, ensuring access to low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, and rules for spectrum sharing to expand available ranges for unlicensed operations. The strategy includes access to additional radio frequency spectrum for unlicensed operations, such as expanding spectrum sharing and allowing underlay operations without interference to licensees. The strategy involves expanding spectrum sharing for unlicensed operations, allowing underlay operations without interference, and exploring other spectrum sharing approaches to improve utilization. The Commission will examine ways to improve databases and systems for spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, as well as consider harmonizing additional bands for unlicensed use. The Commission will submit a report to Congress within 1 year, detailing the strategy developed for improving databases and systems for spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, along with any recommendations for legislative change. The Commission will submit a report to Congress within 1 year detailing the strategy for improving databases and systems for spectrum sharing and access for unlicensed operations, along with any legislative change recommendations. The report will also be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Considerations include recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address costs incurred by Federal entities. The report required under subsection (a) will consider recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address costs incurred by Federal entities related to sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed operations. It will also explore ways to ensure the solvency of the fund if used for covering these costs. Additionally, it will assess the feasibility of unlicensed operations. The report will address recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs related to sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed operations. It will also explore the feasibility of permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference, and consider alternative spectrum sharing techniques. The report will explore the feasibility of allowing unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference, including homeland security or national security communications. It will also consider alternative spectrum sharing techniques for radio technologies accessing Federal spectrum."
