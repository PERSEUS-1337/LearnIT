    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, focused on granting flexibility to grantees. The NCLB expanded existing flexibility authorities and introduced new ones. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, with updates on major developments. The report provides an overview of authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, allowing waivers of federal program requirements under certain eligibility criteria. It will be updated periodically to reflect new developments and impacts. The report discusses authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, allowing waivers of federal program requirements under certain eligibility criteria. \"Flexibility\" refers to the authority to waive restrictions on federal aid for state or local aid recipients, in exchange for meeting accountability requirements related to program outcomes. This flexibility includes provisions for consolidating programs or transferring funds among programs to broaden the use of federal assistance. The flexibility granted to state and local education programs allows for waivers of federal requirements in exchange for meeting accountability criteria. This includes consolidating programs, transferring funds, and waiving specific requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The flexibility authorities granted to state and local education programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act allow for waivers of federal requirements in exchange for meeting accountability criteria. These authorities do not apply to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) due to specific issues and requirements unique to that program. The report focuses on federal involvement in K-12 education through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), excluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) due to specific program requirements. The ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, with discussions on potential amendments and extensions by the 110th Congress. The report will be regularly updated to reflect legislative developments.

The report examines federal K-12 education program requirements, including special flexibility authorities to waive certain requirements. It analyzes issues specific to these authorities and concludes with cross-cutting issues. The report also reviews general types of program requirements applicable to ESEA and related federal K-12 programs, which can be waived for some states and LEAs under the special flexibility authorities. The curr_chunk provides an overview of program requirements for federal K-12 education programs, which can be waived for states and LEAs under special flexibility authorities. These requirements, known as \"accountability requirements,\" ensure that federal funds are used in line with program purposes. Federal programs typically have specific requirements related to pupil eligibility, fund allocation, and outcomes. Federal K-12 education programs have accountability requirements to ensure proper use of federal funds, with specific eligibility and fund allocation criteria. These programs focus on student populations with special needs and specific educational aspects. Federal K-12 education programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. Federal K-12 education programs are categorized based on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. These programs are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs due to their targeted focus. Most federal K-12 education programs are categorized as either categorical or block grant programs, with a focus on specific student populations or subject areas like math or science. The Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A stands out as a block grant program due to its support for a broad range of activities. Federal requirements and guidance are provided to states through three general sources. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a block grant program due to its broad support for various activities. Federal requirements and guidance are provided to state and local recipients through three general sources. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a block grant program with federal requirements and guidance provided to state and local recipients. \"Requirements\" must be met by grantees as a matter of law, derived from the authorizing statute or other federal statutes. Program regulations supplement statutory language primarily on complex issues. Program regulations, published in the Federal Register and integrated into the Code of Federal Regulations, supplement statutory language on complex issues where guidance is deemed insufficient by the U.S. Department of Education. One example is ESEA Title I-A requirements on curriculum content and pupil performance standards. The U.S. Department of Education prioritizes specific actions for complex issues, such as ESEA Title I-A requirements on curriculum and assessments. Authorizing statutes may require ED to publish regulations, while non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided for many programs. The U.S. Department of Education publishes regulations for aid programs as required by authorizing statutes. Additionally, non-regulatory policy guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters, is provided for many programs, although grantees are not legally obligated to follow this guidance. Grantees are provided with non-regulatory guidance in the form of questions and answers or \"Dear Colleague\" letters from the U.S. Secretary of Education. While not legally binding, this guidance aims to address specific program-related queries. Grantees may perceive following this guidance as reducing challenges to their use of federal aid. The non-regulatory guidance provided to grantees aims to address specific program-related queries, but grantees may perceive following this guidance as reducing challenges to their use of federal aid. This guidance is often treated as equivalent to regulations, even if not explicitly required to do so. Non-regulatory guidance provided to grantees by ED, similar to competitive priorities, may be perceived as equivalent to regulations, influencing how federal aid is utilized. In grant competitions, ED sets priorities for applications to receive preferential consideration, such as serving schools with high numbers of low-income students. These priorities, not regulations, are published in the Federal Register and increase the chances of receiving support. While applicants are not required to meet priorities set by ED in grant competitions, doing so increases their likelihood of receiving support. These priorities are not regulations but are typically published in the Federal Register. In recent years, there has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all, relying solely on statutory guidance. Since the adoption of the IASA in 1994, there has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all, relying solely on statutory guidance. For ESEA programs like Title I-A, the regulations are generally briefer and address fewer issues than before the early 1990s. No supplementation by regulations for ESEA programs like Title I-A, with a trend towards less voluminous regulations since the IASA in 1994. Regulations are generally briefer and address fewer issues than before the early 1990s, focusing on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. The regulations for ESEA Title I-A post IASA in 1994 took a minimalist approach, focusing on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. The Department of Education has continued this strategy post-NCLB of 2001, publishing regulations on a limited number of topics only when necessary. Following the NCLB of 2001, the Department of Education has adopted a minimalist approach to regulating ESEA Title I-A. Regulations are only published when absolutely necessary, with a focus on providing flexibility and clarification through nonregulatory guidance. This guidance aims to inform schools, parents, districts, states, and other stakeholders about legal and policy issues under the Title I programs. The Secretary plans to issue nonregulatory guidance for Title I programs to provide flexibility and clarification for State and local educational agencies. This guidance will inform schools, parents, districts, and other stakeholders about different approaches to meet federal K-12 education assistance program requirements. The federal K-12 education assistance program requirements include a broad range of activities, services, or outcomes that SEAs, LEAs, and other aid grantees must provide to show evidence of meeting program goals and accountability for appropriate use of federal aid funds. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements aim to establish accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds by focusing on eligible localities, pupils, and purposes to promote equal educational opportunities and improve student outcomes. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements focus on accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds. This includes target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability to ensure funds are used effectively to improve student achievement and enhance K-12 instruction. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements focus on accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds, ensuring funds are used effectively to improve student achievement and enhance K-12 instruction. Fiscal accountability is also emphasized to provide financial integrity and prevent supplanting of state or local funds. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements emphasize accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds to improve student achievement and prevent supplanting of state or local funds. Specific requirements include targeting resources on high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, ensuring funds supplement state and local resources, enhancing parental participation, implementing staff qualifications, and reporting program information to parents and the public. The federal elementary and secondary education program requires funds to be used for high priority services, ensure funds supplement state and local resources, enhance parental participation, implement staff qualifications, report program information, meet student achievement goals, and evaluate instructional services. Non-compliance may result in fund repayment or prohibition from receiving further funds. The federal elementary and secondary education program requires funds to be used for high priority services, ensure funds supplement state and local resources, enhance parental participation, implement staff qualifications, report program information, meet student achievement goals, and evaluate instructional services. Grantees that violate regulations may have to repay funds or be prohibited from receiving further grants. Additional sanctions may apply for states or LEAs that fail to meet requirements. The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and financial management requirements from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) apply to all recipients of federal education assistance. Sanctions for non-compliance with regulations may include repayment of funds or being prohibited from receiving further grants. Specific sanctions for states or LEAs failing to meet requirements are also outlined in authorizing statutes. Federal regulations, including EDGAR and OMB requirements, apply to recipients of federal education assistance. LEAs participating in child nutrition programs must also comply with related regulations, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income students. LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must comply with various regulations related to civil rights, privacy of student records, workplace safety, environmental protection, access for persons with disabilities, and labor relations. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in other aspects of using federal education assistance. Regulations from federal agencies other than ED may apply to LEAs and schools as employers, covering areas such as workplace safety, environmental protection, and access for persons with disabilities. State and local educational agencies have significant discretion in areas like grade levels, subject areas, and instructional techniques. The use of federal education assistance allows state and local agencies discretion in areas like grade levels, subject areas, and instructional techniques. Requirements under programs like ESEA and NCLB are typically broad, leaving room for state and local discretion. Critics often focus on specific program requirements, such as the need for \"scientifically based\" instructional methods. Program-specific requirements under federal education assistance programs are often criticized for restrictions on fund commingling, resource use, and targeted aid. Criticism of federal education assistance programs includes prohibitions against fund commingling, restrictions on resource use, targeted aid requirements, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability mandates. These criticisms aim to establish fiscal accountability. The requirements for federal education assistance programs include targeting aid on specific pupils or schools, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability mandates under ESEA Title I-A. Prohibitions against fund commingling aim to establish fiscal accountability, while restrictions on resource use and targeting aid on those with the greatest needs focus limited funds where they are most needed. Eligibility thresholds for flexibility, such as ESEA Title I-A schoolwide programs, are also in place. The accountability measures in federal education assistance programs focus on targeting aid to pupils and schools with the greatest needs, establishing fiscal accountability, and increasing effectiveness through outcome accountability requirements. Eligibility thresholds for flexibility, such as ESEA Title I-A schoolwide programs, are also discussed. The new outcome accountability requirements under NCLB aim to enhance the effectiveness of federally supported education services by shifting the focus towards improved outcomes. However, these requirements may appear inflexible from a state or local perspective, particularly for low enrollment LEAs receiving small grants from various federal programs. The categorical approach of larger ED programs directs aid at high-need pupil groups, such as disadvantaged and LEP pupils, but may lead to unintended effects like fragmented services and inefficient resource use. The categorical approach of larger ED programs directs aid at high-need pupil groups like disadvantaged and LEP pupils, but may have unintended effects such as fragmented services, inefficient resource use, and partial needs treatment. The traditional federal categorical approach in larger ED programs has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on targeting resources rather than improving achievement for pupils with special needs. The traditional federal categorical approach in larger ED programs has been criticized for fragmented instruction and focusing on resources rather than improving pupil achievement. Difficulties may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying educational policies and demographic conditions, leading to misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations. Some federal programs face challenges due to categorical structures and requirements, stemming from misunderstandings or strict interpretations of federal statutes and regulations. State and local education officials often express concerns about constraints on program use. State and local education officials sometimes complain about constraints on the use of federal funds, stemming from efforts to focus aid on needy pupils and avoid monitoring and audit issues. A 1998 GAO report found that LEA staff are concerned about various requirements for recipients of federal funds. A 1998 GAO report found that LEA staff often struggle to obtain current and concise information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance, leading to concerns about inadequate technical assistance. LEA staff struggle to obtain current, accurate, and concise information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance, leading to concerns about inadequate technical assistance and limited flexibility in complying with administrative responsibilities. The GAO report found that LEA staff often lack awareness of available flexibility, express concerns about meeting administrative responsibilities, and face challenges with timelines and logistical issues in federal K-12 education programs. Prior authorities allow waivers to address these issues. Prior to the NCLB, authorities allowed waivers for federal K-12 program requirements by SEAs and LEAs, limited in scope and eligibility. Some waivers are case-by-case, addressing logistical challenges in meeting timelines. Prior to the NCLB, waivers were adopted to waive federal K-12 program requirements by SEAs and LEAs. These waivers are limited in scope and eligibility, with some being case-by-case. Some authorities require additional accountability for pupil outcomes. In addition to Ed-Flex and Secretarial case-by-case waivers, there is a high degree of school-level flexibility in fund usage under federal programs. Some waiver authorities are requested on a case-by-case basis, while others offer \"blanket\" waiver authority. Different authorities have varying levels of accountability for pupil outcomes. Schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs provide a range of flexibility in fund usage. Five types of special flexibility in the use of funds are provided under different federal programs, including the schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, the Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These authorities were established before the NCLB of 2001 and are described below. Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education can delegate authority to states to waive certain requirements for schools under selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, it was later expanded to a maximum of 12 states. The Ed-Flex program allows the Department of Education to delegate authority to states to waive requirements for schools under selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, it was later expanded to 12 states and modified in 1999 to remove the cap on participating states. Additional technical amendments were made in 2001 and legislation in 2006 extended Ed-Flex authority. The Ed-Flex program was initially authorized for six states in 1994 and later expanded to 12 states in FY1996. The cap on participating states was removed in 1999, and technical amendments were made in 2001. Legislation in 2006 extended Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. 10 states obtained Ed-Flex status under P.L. 106-25. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since. The Ed-Flex program was extended in 2006 under P.L. 109-211 to grant authority to 10 states, including Colorado, Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont. No new states have been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. The recent congressional action addressed the expiration of authority for the 10 Ed-Flex states. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority under P.L. 106-25 for ED to grant Ed-Flex authority to additional states expired at the end of FY2004. Recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) extended Ed-Flex authority for all 10 states until legislation reauthorizing ESEA Title I, Part A is enacted. Under P.L. 109-211, all 10 Ed-Flex states retain their authority until ESEA Title I, Part A is reauthorized. However, ED cannot extend Ed-Flex authority to additional states. States must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A. States participating in Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, and submit annual reports on outcomes to ED. States participating in Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools under ESEA Title I-A, and submit annual reports on outcomes to ED for various federal programs. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive requirements for schools under various federal programs, including ESEA Title I-A, and submit reports to the Department of Education. Additionally, it includes several ESEA programs administered by SEAs and funded by formula, along with the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive requirements for federal programs like ESEA Title I-A, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. These programs are administered by SEAs and allocate funds by formula. ED has also allowed states to waive some administrative requirements under GEPA and EDGAR for these programs. The Ed-Flex program permits states to waive certain administrative requirements for federal education programs, including ESEA Title I-A, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. ED has interpreted this authority to include waiving some cross-cutting administrative requirements of GEPA and EDGAR for these programs, with exceptions for fiscal accountability measures. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain administrative requirements for federal education programs, including ESEA Title I-A, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. This includes waiving fiscal accountability measures, such as maintaining spending levels and ensuring equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive administrative requirements for federal education programs, including ESEA Title I-A, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. Waivers must ensure equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers, parental involvement, allocation of funds, school selection requirements, and civil rights compliance. LEAs in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA for waivers, except for statewide \"blanket\" waivers. SEAs cannot waive requirements applicable to themselves. Local waivers in Ed-Flex states must be requested by LEAs from their SEA, following similar requirements as waivers requested directly from ED. SEAs cannot waive their own requirements and must ensure that the purposes of the statutory requirements are still being met. Waivers may be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. SEAs must ensure that the purposes of statutory requirements are met for waivers granted. Local waivers may be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers, including effects on student performance. Beginning two years after P.L. 106-25 enactment, annual reports are required. States must submit annual reports on waivers granted for two consecutive years, including information on the effects on student performance. Beginning two years after P.L. 106-25 enactment, ED is to make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The Education Department (ED) is required to make state reports on Ed-Flex waivers available to Congress and the public annually. However, a report prepared in 2001 lacked information on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and program impacts. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. The Education Department (ED) failed to provide comprehensive reports on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and program impacts. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED, overlooking ongoing activities in states with Ed-Flex authority. The Ed-Flex authority allows for waivers to be granted to SEAs or LEAs by the U.S. Secretary of Education, primarily focusing on Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. Requests for waivers must be made by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. The Ed-Flex authority, found in Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, allows the Secretary of Education to waive requirements for programs authorized by the ESEA. Requests for waivers must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for specific, measurable educational goals to be set for eligible pupils, with methods to measure progress annually. Certain requirements cannot be waived, including prohibitions on using funds for state school finance programs and religious worship. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for specific educational goals for eligible pupils, with certain requirements that cannot be waived, including prohibitions on using funds for state school finance programs, religious worship, sex education, and charter school eligibility. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for specific educational goals for eligible pupils, with certain prohibitions on using funds for state school finance programs, religious worship, sex education, and charter school eligibility. Waivers granted under this authority may not exceed four years, but can be extended if they contribute to improved student achievement. Waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D can be waived if statutory requirements are still met to the Secretary's satisfaction. The waivers may not exceed four years but can be extended if they improve student achievement. The Secretary can terminate waivers if pupil performance is inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish a notice of the waiver decision in the Federal Register. The Secretary can terminate waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D if pupil performance is inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. A notice of the decision to grant a waiver must be published in the Federal Register, as required by the Secretary of Education. However, the Department had failed to publish such notices for several years, but eventually did so in response to a memorandum from ED's Office of the Inspector General. The Department of Education failed to publish notices of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D for several years. In response to a memorandum, they published a list of waivers granted between 2002 and 2006 in the Federal Register. Most waivers were for administrative cost limitations on formula grants for Indian education. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) led to the granting of 197 waivers between January 2002 and December 2006. Most waivers were for administrative cost limitations on Indian education grants under ESEA Title VII, Part A. Other waivers included extensions for fund obligations, hurricane-related impacts, participation in growth model programs, and LEAs providing supplemental education. Between January 2002 and December 2006, 197 waivers were granted under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Most waivers were for administrative cost limitations on Indian education grants, with others related to fund obligations, hurricane impacts, growth model programs, and LEAs providing supplemental education services. Between January 2002 and December 2006, 197 waivers were granted under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. These waivers allowed LEAs to provide supplemental educational services (SES) instead of school choice during their first year of improvement, and some LEAs identified as needing improvement were allowed to act as SES providers. Other waivers granted exceptions to fiscal accountability and school selection requirements under ESEA Title I-A. Annual reports on waiver effects and effectiveness are required under ESEA Title IX-D. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports on waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D, but it is unclear if any reports have been submitted. Another waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program, allowing for waivers of certain requirements. The Public Charter Schools (PCS) waiver authority allows for waivers of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education has administrative authority, with the exception of requirements associated with the definition of a charter school eligible to receive PCS. No reports have been submitted on waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D. The PCS waiver authority allows for waivers of requirements under the Secretary of Education's administrative authority, except for those related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. This authority is used infrequently and for limited purposes, not discussed further in the report. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can use federal funds for schoolwide programs, offering flexibility in fund usage across various education programs. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can conduct schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage under federal education programs, including Title I-A. These programs can improve services for all pupils, rather than targeting specific disadvantaged students, and are exempt from certain regulations if they meet program intents and address beneficiaries' needs. Schoolwide programs for schools with 40% or more low-income students can receive flexibility in fund usage under federal education programs, including Title I-A. These programs are exempt from certain regulations if they meet program intents and address beneficiaries' needs, ensuring funds supplement rather than supplant other sources. Title I-A and other federal program funds must supplement, not supplant, other school funds. IDEA requirements must still be met in schoolwide programs, primarily significant for Title I-A. The use of funds authorized under IDEA in schoolwide programs must still meet all programmatic requirements. Schoolwide program authority is primarily significant for Title I-A, as other programs typically focus on LEAs overall, not individual schools. Non-Title I-A programs focused on individual schools are not usually targeted at groups of pupils with specific educational needs, except for IDEA. The ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, combining them with state and local funds without separate accounting, is a significant form of flexibility compared to traditional \"targeted assistance\" programs. The schoolwide program authority allows for flexibility in using Title I-A funds without separate accounting, a significant change from traditional \"targeted assistance\" programs. This increased flexibility has led to a rapid growth in schoolwide programs, with a large majority of Title I-A pupils now being served by them. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB, leading to a rapid growth in the number of schoolwide programs. This increased flexibility allows funds to be used to serve the lowest achieving pupils in a school. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families, leading to a significant increase in the number of schoolwide programs. This change allows funds to be used to serve all disadvantaged pupils in high poverty schools, rather than just the lowest-achieving individuals. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families, allowing funds to serve all disadvantaged pupils in high poverty schools. This change aims to provide special assistance to all pupils in need and ensure Title I-A grants have a meaningful impact on overall school services. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families, aiming to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils in high poverty schools. Questions arise about the validity of this rationale for schools just meeting the new threshold, with little evidence of achievement effects from this expansion. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under ESEA Title VI-B allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. This flexibility was initially authorized under P.L. 106-554 and extended by the NCLB. There is limited evidence on the achievement effects of expanding schoolwide programs to the national average percentage of pupils from low-income families. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. This flexibility was authorized under P.L. 106-554 and extended by the NCLB. LEAs with fewer than 600 pupils or in counties with low population density qualify for this special flexibility authority. LEAs with total average daily attendance below 600 pupils or located in rural areas with low population density can combine funds from ESEA Titles II-A, II-D, IV-A, and V-A for various educational activities. LEAs in rural areas with low population density or with total average daily attendance below 600 pupils have the authority to combine funds from various ESEA Titles for educational activities. This includes Titles II-A, II-D, IV-A, and V-A, which can be used for a range of authorized programs. The rationale for this flexibility is to accommodate the smaller grants received by these LEAs. LEAs in rural areas with low population density or with total average daily attendance below 600 pupils can combine funds from various ESEA Titles for educational activities. This flexibility allows for more effective use of funds due to the small size of grants received by these LEAs. Small, rural LEAs can combine funds from different ESEA Titles to support educational activities, as the grants they receive are often too small to be effective. This \"REAP Flex\" authority allows for more efficient use of funds, similar to a broader Transferability authority available to all LEAs under NCLB. The key difference is that the small, rural LEA authority applies to 100% of the funds under the affected programs. The \"REAP Flex\" authority provides special flexibility to small, rural LEAs, allowing them to transfer 100% of funds from various ESEA Titles III and IV-B programs. This authority is advantageous as it enables more efficient use of funds for educational activities. The \"REAP Flex\" authority allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds from ESEA Titles III and IV-B programs, providing flexibility in fund usage. This authority is advantageous as it enables more efficient use of funds for educational activities. According to a study by ED in July 2007, approximately 4,781 LEAs are eligible for this flexibility authority, with an estimated 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority. According to a study by ED in July 2007, participation in REAP Flex is widespread, with approximately 4,781 LEAs eligible and an estimated 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority in 2005-2006. LEAs most often transferred funds from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A. Rural LEAs participating in REAP Flex in 2005-2006 transferred funds from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A, finding the flexibility useful due to small formula allocations for school improvement activities. Confusion existed between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority at the LEA level. Rural LEAs found flexibility in transferring funds under REAP Flex useful due to small formula allocations for school improvement activities. Confusion existed at the LEA level between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, offers special flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is a K-12 education program considered a block grant by ED, offering flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A is a K-12 education block grant program offering flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A funds provide flexibility to states and LEAs, consolidating categorical programs since 1981. Funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17, with a majority going to LEAs through state-developed formulas. ESEA Title V-A funds are allocated to states and LEAs based on population aged 5-17, with a minimum allocation of 0.5% to each state. SEAs distribute funds to LEAs using state-developed formulas that consider enrollment, with adjustments for high-cost pupils from disadvantaged families. The distribution of ESEA Title V-A funds to states and LEAs is based on state-developed formulas that consider enrollment and provide increased grants per pupil to LEAs with high-cost pupils from disadvantaged families. The minimum percentage of funds suballocated to LEAs varies depending on the program's funding level. Economically disadvantaged families and those in sparsely populated or concentrated poverty areas receive suballocated funds. States must allocate at least 85% of the grant to LEAs for FY2002. States with excess Title V-A grants must suballocate 100% to LEAs, except for those receiving the minimum grant amount, which must suballocate 50%. States must suballocate a minimum of 85% of the grant to LEAs for FY2002. For states with excess Title V-A grants, 100% must be suballocated to LEAs, except for those receiving the minimum grant amount, which must suballocate 50%. Of the funds retained by states, no more than 15% can be used for administrative costs, with the remainder designated for specific programs and services. The level of funds that must be suballocated to LEAs is only 50%. States can retain up to 15% for administrative costs, with the rest designated for specific programs and services such as pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, school choice options, school repair, and statewide education reform. The Title V-A funds allocated to LEAs can be used for various programs such as charter schools, school choice options, school repair, and statewide education reform. LEAs have flexibility in choosing from 27 different innovative assistance programs. LEAs can use Title V-A funds for 27 different innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, same gender schools, school nurses, education reform projects, and programs to improve academic achievement of disadvantaged students. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for various innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, school nurses, education reform projects, and programs to improve academic achievement of disadvantaged students. The broad categories of authorized use of funds make Title V-A generally considered a block grant, with a prohibition against SEAs influencing LEA decisions on fund usage. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for innovative assistance programs for school students. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating federal K-12 education programs. The statute prohibits SEAs from influencing LEA decisions on fund usage. The program authorized by ESEA Title V-A in 1981 consolidated over 40 federal K-12 education programs into Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. Initially proposed as a block grant, it later led to the authorization of new categorical programs. The ESEA Title V-A program consolidated over 40 federal K-12 education programs into a block grant. Despite the initial reduction in programs, new categorical programs were later authorized. A study found that 58% of recipient LEAs used Title V-A funds for instructional materials. The ESEA Title V-A program consolidated multiple federal K-12 education programs into a block grant. A study revealed that 58% of recipient LEAs used funds for instructional materials, while others allocated funds for educational technology and targeted academic services. Large LEAs often utilized funds for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts. Services funded by the program were not frequently aimed at high-need areas. While 39% of LEAs used substantial funds for educational technology and 34% for supplemental targeted academic services, large LEAs were particularly likely to use Title V-A funds for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts. Resources funded by the program were not often targeted at high-need pupils or schools. The primary factors influencing decisions on fund usage were long-term LEA plans and individual school priorities. Appropriations for Title V-A have significantly decreased over the years, from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007. Appropriations for Title V-A funds have steeply declined over the years, from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007. The program may be effectively terminated as P.L. 110-161 provides zero funds for Title V-A in FY2008. This trend is due to a lack of constituencies advocating for increased funding. Appropriations for Title V-A funds have declined significantly over the years, reaching $99 million in FY2007. P.L. 110-161, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008, does not allocate any funds for Title V-A, potentially leading to the program's termination. The lack of advocacy for increased funding has contributed to this trend. Title V-A program has support from state and local education officials and private school administrators, but its funding has been supplemented by other sources like REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. Limited information on its effects may have led to reduced funding levels compared to programs with clearer targeting of funds. Title V-A program funding relies on alternative sources like REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, with limited information on its effects potentially impacting funding levels. This program has received less favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs showing clear targeting of funds and improved educational outcomes, especially for high need pupil groups. ESEA Title V-A was amended by NCLB to require states to report on how the assistance contributes to student academic achievement or quality improvement. ESEA Title V-A was amended by NCLB to require states to report on how assistance contributes to student academic achievement or quality improvement, allowing SEAs and LEAs to increase funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. The NCLB allows SEAs and LEAs to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs, providing flexibility for states and LEAs to improve academic achievement or education quality for students. Additional provisions preceding the NCLB offer marginal impact compared to the flexibility authorities described above. The NCLB allows SEAs and LEAs to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs, providing flexibility for states and LEAs to improve academic achievement or education quality for students. Additional provisions preceding the NCLB offer marginal impact compared to the flexibility authorities described above, such as authority for consolidated SEA or LEA applications, plans, or reports for ESEA programs. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing SEAs and LEAs to consolidate applications, plans, and reports for various programs. This act also expanded existing flexibility options for administrative convenience. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing SEAs and LEAs to consolidate applications, plans, and reports for various programs. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA, as amended by the NCLB, allows most LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. The NCLB amendments introduced flexibility for ESEA programs, allowing LEAs to transfer funds among different programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer funds, except from ESEA Title I-A. The NCLB amendments allow LEAs to transfer funds among different ESEA programs, with restrictions on transferring funds from Title I-A. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer up to 30% of their grants to address the failure, while states can transfer up to 50% of program funds. LEAs under corrective actions for Title I-A cannot transfer funds. According to NCLB amendments, LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer 30% of their grants to address the failure, while states can transfer up to 50% of program funds. LEAs under corrective actions for Title I-A cannot transfer funds. The Transferability authority allows states to transfer a limited amount of program funds, excluding administrative funds, among certain programs. The total appropriations for the programs subject to this authority amount to approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008. This authority is relatively simple and available to most LEAs without much complication. The Transferability authority for states is limited, with a total of approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008 appropriations for the programs subject to this authority. It is relatively simple and available to most LEAs without specific application or approval, allowing for a wide range of purposes for transferred funds. The Transferability authority allows for the transfer of funds to most LEAs without specific approval, with a wide range of purposes. Program requirements still apply to transferred funds, and funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years. The Transferability authority allows funds to be block granted to LEAs without specific approval, with program requirements still applying. Participation is relatively modest, with 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. The Transferability authority allows funds to be block granted to LEAs without specific approval, with program requirements still applying. Participation is relatively modest, with approximately 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. Estimates of participation levels are complicated by confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities at the LEA level. There is confusion at the LEA level between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, leading to conflicting reports on the use of Transferability. LEAs participating in Transferability mostly moved funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. Many used Transferability to offset reductions in formula funding. LEAs frequently utilized Transferability to shift funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A, compensating for reductions in formula grants and targeting resources more effectively. Some LEAs did not participate in Transferability due to various reasons. The evaluation report found that LEAs often used Transferability to reallocate funds from certain federal programs to schools failing to meet standards or to have more flexibility. Reasons for not participating included lack of information, satisfaction with current flexibility levels, or insufficient funding. The new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows for up to seven programs to be combined for greater flexibility. The new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate their state administration and activity funds under various federal programs. Reasons for not participating in Transferability include lack of information, satisfaction with current flexibility levels, or insufficient funding. Under the State-Flex authority, up to seven states can consolidate their state administration and activity funds for various federal programs under the new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act. This allows the funds to be used for any purpose authorized under any ESEA program. Under the State-Flex authority, states can consolidate funds from various federal programs for five years, allowing flexibility in fund usage. States risk losing authority if they fail to meet AYP requirements for two consecutive years or fail to comply with terms. States granted authority to consolidate funds from federal programs for five years, subject to meeting AYP requirements. Authority may be terminated if terms are not met, but can be renewed if requirements are fulfilled. Selected states must enter into agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty areas. Selected states must enter into agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty areas. LEAs can consolidate funds under local flexibility authority and align fund usage with state's guidelines. Child poverty rates of 20% or more, slightly above the national average of 18%. LEAs can consolidate funds under local flexibility authority and align fund usage with state guidelines. States may specify purposes for LEAs' use of funds under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. Participating states can specify purposes for LEAs' use of funds under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. State-Flex authority has only been granted to Florida, but they withdrew before implementation. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. Under the \"Local-Flex\" authority, a limited number of LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs for specific purposes. LEAs in the State Flexibility Demonstration can consolidate funds from multiple programs for five years, including Title II-A, Title II-D-1, Title IV-A-1, and Title V-A, with a 4% cap on administration costs. Failure to meet AYP requirements for two years or comply with regulations results in losing this authority. LEAs can consolidate funds from various ESEA programs, including Title V-A, for five years with a 4% cap on administration costs. Failure to meet AYP requirements for two years or comply with regulations results in losing this authority. If goals are met, authority is renewed for another two-year term. Under the flexibility agreement, LEAs must meet established goals to renew their authority for another two-year term. Certain requirements, such as civil rights and fiscal accountability, cannot be waived. Annual reports on fund usage must be disseminated. The Local-Flex program allows LEAs to consolidate funds but certain requirements like fiscal accountability and equitable participation cannot be waived. Annual reports on fund usage must be shared. Seattle, Washington, the only LEA to participate, had its eligibility suspended for failing to make AYP. Seattle, Washington is the only LEA to participate in the Local-Flex program, but its eligibility was suspended for not meeting AYP. Despite efforts by ED to promote State-Flex and Local-Flex authority, there has been little interest from states and LEAs. Seattle has applied for a new Local-Flex agreement, but there has been minimal interest from states and LEAs in participating in State-Flex and Local-Flex programs. Only one LEA has ever participated in Local-Flex, and no states have participated in State-Flex. Barriers to participation include additional responsibilities with few clear benefits. Only one LEA has ever participated in Local-Flex, and no states in State-Flex. A recent study identified major barriers to participation in both programs, including additional responsibilities with few benefits, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination. A new round of competition for these authorities began in March 2004. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities began in March 2004, offering preference in future grant competitions for participants. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities began in March 2004, offering preference in future grant competitions for participants. States and LEAs participating in State-Flex or Local-Flex would receive preference in future grant competitions. The rationale for this preference is that participants have undergone comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement, especially for disadvantaged students. The preference for State-Flex and Local-Flex participants is based on their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement, especially for disadvantaged students. These programs allow for broad use of funds authorized under any ESEA program, with few specified requirements. State-Flex and Local-Flex programs allow for broad use of funds under any ESEA program with few specified requirements, but participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and a small number of LEAs. Despite multiple invitations, interest from SEAs and LEAs has been limited. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation, with only a maximum of seven states and a small number of LEAs involved. Despite multiple invitations, interest from SEAs and LEAs has been minimal. The State-Flex authority allows for some flexibility in fund usage but states must still meet their administrative responsibilities under each program. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have very limited participation, with only a few states and LEAs involved despite multiple invitations. State-Flex authority allows for flexibility in fund usage, but states must still meet their administrative responsibilities. The share of funds for state administration varies from 1% to 26.5% for different programs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation, with varying shares of funds for state administration ranging from 1% to 26.5% for different programs. Participating states and LEAs have influence over fund usage and local performance agreements. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs allow states and LEAs to have influence over fund usage and local performance agreements, with participation ranging from 1% to 26.5%. Participating LEAs in the state demonstration program may have diminished flexibility due to alignment with state fund usage and authority given to states over Title V-A funds. Participating LEAs in the state demonstration program may have reduced flexibility as their use of consolidated funds must align with state fund usage and state authority over Title V-A funds. The inclusion of ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance, as those funds can already be used for a wide range of activities. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex authority with earlier flexibility authorities shows differences in fund usage and control. The Local-Flex authority under the Innovative Programs block grant is of limited significance as the funds can already be used for a wide range of activities. Comparing it with the State-Flex authority shows differences in fund usage and control. The final provisions of H.R. 1, also known as the NCLB, are similar to the House version authorizing local flexibility demonstrations. The Senate's broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority was not included in the final legislation but sparked significant debate during the process. The Senate's broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority in H.R. 1 sparked significant debate during the legislative process, although it was not included in the final legislation. The provisions would have offered greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 would have provided more flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. However, the authorities were still more limited than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation proposals considered during the 106th Congress. The scope of the H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority was the same in terms of the maximum number of participating states (7) but more narrow in the number of LEAs in other states (25) that could participate. Program requirements such as civil rights and fiscal accountability continued to apply. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority, considered during the 106th Congress, had similar program requirements like civil rights and fiscal accountability. It allowed for participation of 7 states and 25 LEAs in other states, with a broader range of ESEA programs and higher funding levels. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority in the 106th Congress applied to a broad range of ESEA programs with higher funding levels, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged and Limited English Proficient/Immigrant Education. States could use funds for authorized activities under various programs, including the Innovative Programs block grant. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority in the 106th Congress allowed states to use funds for a wide range of ESEA programs, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged and Limited English Proficient/Immigrant Education. States could reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, with outcome accountability required. State-Flex did not provide similar authority for fund reallocation. The Senate version of H.R. 1 required participating states to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount, ensuring achievement gains beyond state standards. State-Flex did not allow funds reallocation among LEAs like the previous flexibility/performance agreement authority. The Senate version of H.R. 1 required states and LEAs to surpass AYP goals by a statistically significant margin, indicating achievement gains beyond state standards. This excess achievement must be substantial enough to rule out random variations in pupil scores, especially in larger pupil populations. The report also addresses cross-cutting issues related to the special flexibility provisions mentioned. The report discusses the need for achievement gains to exceed state standards by a significant margin to rule out random variations in pupil scores, especially in larger pupil populations. It also analyzes cross-cutting issues related to special flexibility provisions. The report discusses special flexibility authorities that increase states' and LEAs' ability to use federal aid funds according to their priorities. These authorities are limited in terms of participation, programs affected, and program requirements. The special flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to prioritize federal aid funds based on their own needs, with limitations on participation, programs affected, and requirements that can be waived for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. States and LEAs can waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes, with special flexibility authorities enacted under NCLB. The special flexibility authorities under NCLB allow states and LEAs to waive federal program requirements in exchange for increased attention to outcome accountability. Transferability has been utilized by 12-16% of LEAs, while other flexibility authorities have seen limited interest. The NCLB has introduced increased accountability requirements and flexibility in federal programs. Transferability is used by 12-16% of LEAs, while other flexibility authorities have limited interest. REAP Flex is widely used by small, rural LEAs. Reporting on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement is required. The REAP Flex is the most widely used flexibility authority among eligible small, rural LEAs. Reporting on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement is required, but there is limited information on the specific impact of special forms of flexibility. The REAP Flex is a commonly used flexibility authority for small, rural LEAs, with limited information on its specific impact on pupil achievement. Special flexibility authorities have common characteristics but are restricted in important ways, raising questions about their effectiveness in addressing concerns about federal fund use and administrative burdens. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority, while broad in potential uses, is limited to the school level. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is broad in potential uses but limited to the school level, with only schools slightly above average in low-income pupil rates qualifying. The Secretarial case-by-case waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary. The authority for schoolwide programs under ESEA Title I-A is limited to schools with low-income pupil rates slightly above average. Waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. Transferability authority allows states and LEAs to transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program. The Ed-Flex authority requires individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers. States and LEAs can transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program. Rural LEA flexibility authority is for low-enrollment LEAs. State-Flex authority is limited to seven states. Local-Flex authority affects a limited range of programs. The rural LEA flexibility authority is available to exceptionally low-enrollment LEAs, with limited funds subject to State-Flex authority. Only seven states may participate in State-Flex authority. Local-Flex authority is available in a maximum of 80 LEAs plus 28-70 LEAs in State-Flex states. The limited increase in flexibility provided by these authorities may explain the low rate of participation. Certain requirements cannot be waived under any of these authorities, including fiscal obligations. The rural LEA flexibility authority is available to low-enrollment LEAs, with limited funds subject to State-Flex authority. Local-Flex authority is available in a maximum of 80 LEAs plus 28-70 LEAs in State-Flex states. The limited increase in flexibility provided by these authorities is a probable reason for the low rate of participation. Certain requirements cannot be waived under any of these authorities, including fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A requirements. The flexibility authorities, including fiscal accountability, private school participation, and ESEA Title I-A requirements, do not cover the largest ESEA program, Title I-A. A 1999 GAO report found that existing flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs. The 1999 GAO report found that existing flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, such as requirements under the IDEA, Americans with Disabilities Act, child nutrition program administration, and environmental regulations. The 1999 GAO report identified that current flexibility authorities do not alleviate the primary regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, including requirements under the IDEA, Americans with Disabilities Act, child nutrition program administration, and environmental regulations. Some SEA staff view Ed-Flex as having limited value due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived, while others see it as promoting innovation and flexibility. These perspectives also apply to new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002. The Ed-Flex program is seen as having limited value by some SEA staff due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived. However, others believe it promotes innovation and flexibility. These perspectives also apply to new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002, during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements. During a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements, new authorities were adopted, providing states and LEAs with greater flexibility in determining how funds can be used for programs like ESEA Title I-A and teacher-related initiatives under NCLB. Increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, especially in schoolwide programs. NCLB consolidated programs related to teachers and technology, giving states more flexibility. Special authorities provide marginal additional flexibility. Waivers can remove federal barriers to local educational reform. Limited information on the use of new authorities. The special authorities described provide marginal additional flexibility for using funds in federal education programs. Limited information is available on the use of these new forms of flexibility, with waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities being used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation or reform. Limited information is available on the use of new forms of flexibility authorized under the NCLB, with waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities being used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation or reform. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used to allow a limited number of states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress (AYP) under the ESEA Title I-A accountability. The NCLB eliminated or relaxed certain requirements for all states and LEAs, while the ESEA Title IX-D authority allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP. This flexibility authority was mainly used to transfer funds out of ESEA Title II-A. Under the ESEA Title I-A accountability provisions, flexibility authority was used to move funds between different programs, mainly from Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A to compensate for reductions in formula grants. Many LEAs used Title II-A and Title IV-A funds to compensate for reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, target resources on schools failing to meet standards, or utilize funds with flexibility under Title V-A. Pre-NCLB flexibility authorities were often used to waive certain requirements. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers, Ed-Flex, and other flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements related to ESEA Title I-A and V-A grants, targeting resources on schools not meeting standards or using funds with flexibility. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers and other flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements for ESEA Title I-A and V-A grants, targeting resources on schools not meeting standards or using funds with flexibility. Waivers were most often used to waive requirements such as the minimum low-income pupil percentage threshold for ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility, within-LEA targeting of funds on schools with high numbers of low-income pupils, deadlines for standards and assessments adoption, and limitations on fund use for teacher recruitment and training programs. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers and flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements for ESEA Title I-A and V-A grants, targeting resources on schools not meeting standards or using funds with flexibility. This included limitations on fund use for teacher recruitment and training programs. Schoolwide programs offer flexibility in fund use, but there are concerns about granting this authority to schools with low poverty rates. Schoolwide programs offer flexibility in fund use, but concerns arise about granting this authority to schools with low poverty rates as it may limit the program's impact. Low poverty rate schools may have limited impact with schoolwide programs due to grant size restrictions based on the number of low-income students. There is no clear evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs for disadvantaged students. Waivers to expand Title I-A participation could spread funds among low-poverty schools, reducing concentration on needy schools. The use of waivers to disperse Title I-A funds among low-poverty schools could reduce the concentration of funds on high-poverty schools, potentially undermining accountability requirements. Ed-Flex allows waivers for ESEA Title I-A school selection, potentially reducing funds for high-poverty schools. Waivers used to delay meeting accountability requirements may undermine outcomes. LEAs and states often request waivers for teacher hiring and consortia formation under CSR and Eisenhower programs. The federal requirements for accountability are discussed, with LEAs and states frequently requesting waivers for teacher hiring and consortia formation under CSR and Eisenhower programs. Waivers are often requested to accommodate strict requirements related to teacher training funds and the allocation of funds for professional development. After the enactment of NCLB, waivers for using CSR funds for teacher salaries, teacher training in math and science, and professional development have become less relevant. NCLB also lowered the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income students. Following the enactment of NCLB, there have been changes in the use of funds and flexibility authorities. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was lowered to 40% of low-income students. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was lowered to 40% of pupils from low-income families nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were combined into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. Limited information is available on the impact of special flexibility on pupil achievement. States with Ed-Flex authority must submit annual reports on waivers granted and their impact. Relatively few substantive waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB. Limited information is available on the impact of special flexibility on pupil achievement. Anecdotal information exists on the achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers, but no comprehensive reports have been published on their purposes or effects. Limited information is available on the impact of waivers granted under the Ed-Flex authority. Anecdotal information on achievement effects in a limited number of LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. No comprehensive reports have been published on the purposes or effects of waivers granted under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. The 1999 ED report included information on the effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a limited number of LEAs, focusing on whether they met state AYP standards. Supporters of flexibility authorities argue that these waivers have supported standards-based reform in affected states by facilitating program coordination and planning. The 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex highlighted how Ed-Flex authority supports standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination, strengthening planning processes, and streamlining administration of programs. Ed-Flex encourages LEAs and schools to develop instructional programs without standard federal or state program constraints, streamlining administration by reducing paperwork. It supports resource use for increased student achievement and narrowing achievement gaps by focusing on outcomes rather than inputs or procedures. Ed-Flex supports resource use for increased student achievement and narrowing achievement gaps by focusing on outcomes rather than inputs or procedures. Limited data showing improved pupil achievement outcomes in states, LEAs, or schools with special flexibility granted raises questions about the effectiveness of the program. The effectiveness of special flexibility granted by Ed-Flex in improving pupil achievement outcomes is debatable. It raises questions about the availability of sufficient information to analyze the benefits and impact of these authorities. The lack of information from the Department of Education on the use of special flexibility authorities makes it challenging to assess their benefits and impact on pupil achievement. The Department of Education has not provided relevant information on the use of special flexibility authorities, making it difficult to evaluate their significance and impact on pupil achievement. The special flexibility authorities lack relevant information for evaluating their impact on pupil achievement. The question arises whether outcome emphasis can adequately replace other forms of accountability requirements. The outcome accountability requirements for these authorities involve goals set by states and LEAs. The outcome accountability requirements associated with special flexibility authorities involve goals set by states and LEAs, including meeting state-established adequate yearly progress (AYP) requirements under ESEA Title I-A. The flexibility authorities granted to states and LEAs involve implementing programs like Ed-Flex, State-Flex, or Local-Flex, and meeting state-established AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. Some programs, like the Innovative Programs block grant, do not directly link flexibility authority to outcome accountability. States granted Ed-Flex authority varied in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals. The Ed-Flex authority granted to states lacked direct linkage to outcome accountability, as shown in a GAO study. Some states had unclear outcome goals, with only one state establishing specific objectives linked to schools and pupils affected by waivers. The GAO study found that many Ed-Flex states lacked specific outcome goals for waivers, with limited oversight from the Department of Education. The GAO study found limited oversight from the Department of Education regarding Ed-Flex implementation by states, with varying levels of detail in the information provided. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond meeting AYP requirements. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond meeting AYP requirements. Instead, they emphasize attention to failing to meet generally applicable outcome accountability requirements. The current flexibility authorities for participating in Title I-A and other ESEA programs place increased emphasis on meeting outcome accountability requirements, especially for failing to do so. States with special flexibility authority have an additional incentive to meet these requirements to maintain their eligibility. The enhanced outcome accountability requirements for states with special flexibility authority under the NCLB may lead to substantial consequences for failing to meet AYP requirements. Maintaining eligibility to exercise flexibility authority is a key incentive for meeting these requirements. The NCLB introduces enhanced outcome accountability requirements for states with special flexibility authority, emphasizing the importance of meeting AYP requirements to maintain eligibility for flexibility. The provisions aim to balance increased accountability with limited flexibility in federal aid fund usage. The NCLB introduces enhanced outcome accountability requirements for states with special flexibility authority, balancing increased accountability with limited flexibility in federal aid fund usage. Proponents argue that no increase in outcome or other accountability requirements is necessary for granting special forms of flexibility. Some proponents argue that increasing state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds can lead to improved pupil outcomes without the need for additional accountability requirements. Critics may disagree with this justification. Increasing state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds is seen by some as a way to improve pupil outcomes. Critics argue that granting special forms of flexibility without additional accountability requirements is unjustified. Critics argue that special flexibility authorities lack accountability provisions and are often used for unproven purposes, which may not enhance program effectiveness."
