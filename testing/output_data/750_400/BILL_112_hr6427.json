The \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" includes a Job Training Resources Grant Program that provides funds for supporting the purchase, renovation, construction, or lease of real property for qualified self-sustaining job programs. A self-sustaining job program offers job training and placement services to individuals with employment challenges without requiring federal funds for programmatic or administrative expenses. The paragraph describes that for expenses related to providing services, federal funds are not required. Applicants can still participate in other federal programs. Priority is given to eligible applicants showing significant potential in awarding grants. In awarding grants, the Secretary gives priority to eligible applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs or with local organizations that have received grants. The Secretary prioritizes eligible applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs or local organizations that have received grants under section 413(h)(3)(A). Eligible applicants are national organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'eligible applicant' in section 413(h)(3)(A) refers to national organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as States or political subdivisions. The eligible applicants for grants under section 501(a) must provide employment-related services to individuals with employment challenges, including States, political subdivisions, and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Grants are conditioned upon meeting job placement performance goals. Each grant under this paragraph is conditioned upon the establishment of job placement performance goals for qualified self-sustaining job programs. The Secretary, in coordination with the grantee, must establish job placement performance goals for each qualified self-sustaining job program receiving grant funds and determine performance assessment dates. The grantee receiving the grant funds must establish job placement performance goals for each program and determine performance assessment dates. Protection of federal interest is required for all real property purchased or renovated. The Secretary will measure the achievement of goals set by the grantee upon receiving the grant. Federal interest protection is mandatory for all real property acquired or improved using the funds. The Secretary ensures protection of the Federal Government's interest in real property acquired or improved with funds.

Eligible applicants must distribute $200,000,000 for grants among local organizations for qualified self-sustaining job programs.

Repayment of funds to the Treasury is required in proportion to the degree of failure.

Repayment shall be made over a 10-fiscal-year period with no interest accruing on the payments. The Secretary will require repayment of funds over a 10-fiscal-year period without accruing interest if job placement performance goals are not met. Alternatively, the recipient may comply with the goals with the Secretary's consent. The recipient of funds may elect to comply with job placement performance goals with the Secretary's consent, instead of making payments. Compliance must be demonstrated as prescribed by the Secretary. If a State fails to meet goals and incurs a penalty, they can also opt for compliance instead of payments. Compliance must be demonstrated as prescribed by the Secretary. In case of a State penalty, the Secretary may reduce the grant payable to the State over a 10-fiscal-year period.

Subsections (c) and (d) shall not apply to penalties under this paragraph, except for those with reductions under subparagraph (D). Section 409(b)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to include an exclusion from the state reasonable cause exception. The Secretary may reduce the grant payable to a State over a 10-fiscal-year period in case of a penalty, with exceptions to state penalty limitations."
