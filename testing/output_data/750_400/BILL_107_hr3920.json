Section 13 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include special requirements regarding the black-tailed prairie dog. Section 13 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 requires the Secretary to use the best scientific and commercial data available when determining the status of the black-tailed prairie dog. This includes giving greater weight to empirical or peer-reviewed data and considering population numbers of the species. The Secretary must prioritize scientific or field-tested data and consider population numbers when evaluating the status of the black-tailed prairie dog. Field observation data is required for determining if the species is endangered or threatened, and input from landowners is also necessary. The Secretary must rely on field observation data to determine if the black-tailed prairie dog is endangered or threatened. Landowners' data on the species must be accepted and included in the decision-making process. The Secretary must accept landowners' data on the black-tailed prairie dog for inclusion in the decision-making process regarding its status as an endangered or threatened species. The Secretary must consider landowners' data on the black-tailed prairie dog for determining its status as an endangered or threatened species, including independent scientific review requirements. The black-tailed prairie dog's status as an endangered or threatened species must be determined by the Secretary, considering landowners' data and independent scientific review requirements. A qualified individual with expertise in biological sciences is defined as someone who has published peer-reviewed work. The term 'qualified individual' refers to someone with expertise in biological sciences, demonstrated through peer-reviewed scientific literature, relevant to the Secretary's decision on the black-tailed prairie dog's status. The term 'qualified individual' must have scientific expertise on the black-tailed prairie dog or a similar species relevant to the Secretary's decision, without any conflicts of interest. The term 'qualified individual' for the review must have scientific expertise on the black-tailed prairie dog or similar species, without conflicts of interest or financial ties opposing the action under consideration. The Secretary will appoint independent scientific reviewers from a list developed with recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. These reviewers must have no financial interest in opposing the action under consideration. The Secretary appoints independent scientific reviewers from a list recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. Three qualified individuals are randomly selected to review and report on the scientific information and analyses before any action becomes final. Before finalizing any action, the Secretary appoints 3 qualified individuals to review and report on the scientific information. Reviewers are compensated for their independent review. The selection and activities of the reviewers are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Independent reviewers selected for scientific review are compensated and their activities are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Within 3 months, reviewers must provide their opinion on scientific information related to the black-tailed prairie dog. The independent reviewers must provide their opinion on scientific information about the black-tailed prairie dog within 3 months. The Secretary will evaluate the information from the scientific review and include a summary in the final determination. The Secretary will evaluate the independent scientific review of the black-tailed prairie dog and include a summary in the final determination. If the majority of referees' recommendations are not followed, an explanation will be provided. The report of the peer reviewers will be included in the official record of the proposed action. The majority of referees' recommendations from the independent scientific review will be evaluated by the Secretary, with an explanation provided if they are not followed.
