    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for all K-12 students. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Participation in quality physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight youth has more than doubled in the past 30 years. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be more healthy and physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths per year. Physically fit adults have reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke, highlighting the importance of promoting physical activity in children. Children should have daily physical education to promote health and fitness. Inactivity and poor diet contribute to obesity-related diseases costing the US economy over $100 billion annually. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. However, children are not as active as they should be, with fewer than 1 in 4 getting enough vigorous activity each day. Surgeon General's 1996 Report recommends daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. The Surgeon General's 1996 Report recommends daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12 to promote health and fitness. Despite a resolution passed by Congress in 1987, little progress has been made in providing quality physical education programs for all students. It is essential for students to have the opportunity to participate in physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education and incorporating fitness education and assessment. The physical education program for elementary, middle, and secondary school students includes 150 minutes per week of instruction, fitness education, motor skill development, cognitive concepts for lifelong health, and opportunities for social and cooperative skills. The physical education program aims to support emotional development, cognitive concepts for lifelong health, social skills, physical activity, and healthy eating habits. Teachers must have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development opportunities. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees as specialists and receive professional development to stay updated on research and trends. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not part of the assisted physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as large and small student populations. Funding applications can include private and home-schooled students. Reports are required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving grant or contract funding. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress detailing the success of programs improving physical fitness and making recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed. The grant or contract funds for a local educational agency under this part must limit administrative costs to 7 percent. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90 percent in the first year and 75 percent in subsequent years. Funds should supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2004 to support the outlined activities."
