    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. Various government departments have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens, playing a crucial role in biodefense efforts. High-containment laboratories are crucial in the biodefense effort, funded by the federal government to develop countermeasures and detectors for dangerous pathogens. Funding for civilian biodefense increased significantly from FY2001 to FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers handling these pathogens. The increase in funding for civilian biodefense from FY2001 to FY2008 has supported academic and industrial researchers handling dangerous pathogens. This influx of funds has raised concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited research capacity. Non-federal entities have also expanded high-containment laboratories due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally has raised new policy questions. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally has raised new policy questions regarding the necessary federal investment, optimal size and type of laboratories, coordination of efforts, risks of accidents or misuse, and the balance between benefits and risks. Policymakers are increasingly concerned about these issues. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has led to concerns about the need for a coordinated plan to manage the risks of accidents or misuse. Policymakers are interested in tightening government oversight of these facilities to ensure biosecurity and biosafety. The report on Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommends tightening government oversight of high-containment laboratories at the federal level. It discusses biosecurity and biosafety measures to secure pathogens and reduce risks, addressing issues facing policymakers and suggesting policy options for Congress to consider. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related, with biosecurity focusing on securing pathogens from theft and unauthorized use, while biosafety aims to prevent unintentional infections. The Select Agent Program is the major federal regulatory program addressing biosecurity. The Select Agent Program was established to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. It was created in response to the threat of bioterrorism, particularly highlighted by the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program was established to regulate the transfer of organisms and toxins that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. The 2001 anthrax mailings increased government interest in bioterrorism threats, leading to the enactment of laws increasing restrictions on possession of select agents. Entities possessing select agents must develop security and biosafety plans certified by the government. The program oversees regulation of select agents' possession, transfer, and use, focusing on individuals with access to select agents and facilities where they are used. The Select Agent Program requires entities with select agents to have security and biosafety plans certified by the government. Scientists must register with the DOJ for access to select agents, with permits valid for five years. Facilities using select agents must implement security plans to protect against theft or improper access. Plans are submitted to HHS or USDA for review. The Select Agent Program requires facilities to develop security plans to protect select agents from theft or improper access. Permits to handle select agents are valid for five years and must be approved by HHS or USDA. Noncompliance with regulations can result in fines. The Select Agent Program requires facilities to develop security plans to protect select agents. Failure to comply can result in fines. Approximately 390 entities have certificates to work with select agents, with the largest group owned or operated by state or local governments. A Laboratory Response Network has been developed by the federal government to enhance testing and response capabilities following a biological attack. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network to link state or local public health laboratories for robust testing and response capabilities following a biological attack. This network aims to establish a capable laboratory in each state to handle dangerous pathogens. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some entities transferring or destroying their access to select agents. The Select Agent Program in academia has caused tensions due to the perceived onerous regulations. Approximately 200 entities either transferred or destroyed their select agent inventories rather than registering. Investigations by agency Inspectors General have focused on internal controls, processing applications, and regulatory compliance. HHS IG found that 11 out of 15 universities investigated did not fully comply with select agent regulations. The HHS and USDA Inspectors General found non-compliance with select agent regulations in universities and laboratories. Three entities withdrew their select agent licenses. The CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University in 2007. The USDA IG found incomplete controls over registered entities and compliance with select agent regulations. CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University in 2007 due to failure to report exposures and lack of security assessments for lab workers. HHS OIG fined 12 organizations $1,887,000 for non-compliance with select agent regulations. Scientists acknowledge the risks of working with dangerous pathogens and have developed best practices to mitigate them. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risks of contracting diseases and accidental pathogen release. Best practices to mitigate these risks have been developed since the 1970s and 1980s, with guidelines disseminated by HHS in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The CDC and NIH have established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) with specific protections for laboratory researchers. A total of $1,887,000 in fines was imposed on 12 organizations for non-compliance with Select Agent regulations. The CDC and NIH have established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) to guide laboratory researchers in handling biological agents. Each level is associated with specific protections, with higher levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are considered high-containment laboratories. The current guidelines aim to protect workers from specific risks posed by different pathogens. The BMBL guidelines for high-containment laboratories (BSL-3 and BSL-4) were developed to protect workers from specific risks posed by different pathogens. They define biosafety levels, safe laboratory practices, and criteria for identifying the appropriate biosafety level for each organism and procedure. The guidelines emphasize that biosafety levels should be linked to a combination of pathogen and experiment, not specific pathogens. The BMBL outlines primary and secondary infection barriers, as well as standard and special laboratory practices for each biosafety level. The BMBL guidelines emphasize that biosafety levels should be determined by a combination of pathogen and experiment, not specific pathogens. It outlines primary and secondary infection barriers, standard and special laboratory practices, and includes security guidelines for different biosafety levels. Researchers and lab workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the lab, with the correct biosafety level based on the pathogen, its transmission potential, and the research activity. The correct biosafety level for laboratory procedures is determined by the pathogen, its transmission potential, and the research activity. BSL-1 is for procedures unlikely to cause disease, BSL-2 for those treatable with immunization or antibiotics, BSL-3 for potentially lethal diseases from pathogen inhalation, and BSL-4 for high-risk aerosol-transmitted infections. It is possible to handle deadly pathogens safely at lower biosafety levels. Inhalation should be conducted at BSL-3, while high-risk procedures should be done at BSL-4. Pathogens can be handled at lower biosafety levels based on the specific activity. Some select agent pathogens can be handled outside high-containment facilities, such as anthrax at BSL-2 for certain activities and BSL-3 for others. The BMBL recommends handling anthrax at BSL-2 for certain activities and BSL-3 for others. 13 select agents require BSL-4 containment, while 30 can be studied at BSL-2 depending on circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents, while only some BSL-3 facilities do. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may also work with select agents but not all are subject to regulations. BSL-2 facilities have a small proportion regulated under the Select Agent Program, with BMBL guidelines being widely adopted. Compliance with guidelines is voluntary but mandatory for federal contracts and grants to avoid funding loss. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is typically voluntary but mandatory for federal contracts and grants to avoid funding loss. Some federal agencies require compliance in their laboratories. Laboratories regulated under the Select Agent Program must consider BMBL guidelines for biosafety in security plans. Industrial, academic, and non-profit labs appoint health and safety officials to ensure compliance with protective equipment. The BMBL guidelines are crucial for ensuring biosafety in laboratories, especially those regulated under the Select Agent Program. These guidelines are incorporated into building design standards, grant and contract requirements, and other federal regulations related to DNA research. Federal facilities and those built using federal funds must adhere to these design standards, which may also include additional security requirements. Facilities constructed with federal funds must adhere to design standards set by the agency funding the construction, often following guidelines from the BMBL. These standards include security requirements and specifications for systems like ventilation and access controls. For high-containment laboratories, NIH issues checklists to ensure all requirements are met before occupancy, a process known as certifying or commissioning. Similar processes exist in other agencies, with policies and directives mandating compliance. NIH issues checklists to ensure requirements are tested before a laboratory is occupied, a process known as certifying or commissioning. Other agencies follow similar procedures, contracting out the commissioning process for laboratories. The NIH Model Commissioning Guide recommends using specialized individuals for this task. The NIH Model Commissioning Guide recommends using highly specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, for certifying or commissioning laboratory facilities. Compliance with biosafety guidelines, like those in the BMBL, is required for laboratories receiving federal funding. Non-compliance could result in the loss of funding. Laboratory facilities receiving federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL. Non-compliance could lead to the withdrawal of current and future federal funding. Grantee organizations may need to provide evidence of compliance with applicable health and safety standards upon request. Federal research grants require grantees to establish an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with guidelines for recombinant DNA research. The IBC has the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and can enforce specific precautions. Some suggest expanding the IBC's oversight to other research areas. The IBC has the authority to require specific biosafety precautions for recombinant DNA research activities. Some propose extending the IBC's oversight to other research areas, but concerns have been raised about its effectiveness. The BMBL guidelines are incorporated into the Select Agent Program regulations, making compliance with the BMBL mandatory for entities possessing select agents. The Select Agent Program regulations require compliance with the BMBL guidelines for entities possessing select agents. BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space in the United States has significantly increased in recent years due to federal construction and funding. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in BSL-4 space since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research activities, and a focus on public health. The federal government is funding the construction of high-containment laboratories in various departments. The federal government has invested in constructing high-containment laboratories in various departments, including Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. These facilities are either federally owned and operated, federally owned but privately operated, or privately owned and operated. The Department of Defense has had high-containment laboratories since World War II, which have been modernized for offensive and defensive research purposes. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, focusing on offensive and defensive research. President Nixon ended the offensive biological weapons program in 1969, leading to a shift towards defensive work. The United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Frederick, MD, is the main location for BSL-4 laboratory space in DOD, with an ongoing $683 million expansion project. Other DOD laboratories also have BSL-3 laboratory space. The United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Frederick, MD, is the sole location of BSL-4 laboratory space in DOD, with a $683 million expansion project underway. Other DOD laboratories have also increased their BSL-3 capacity since 2001 for research on infectious diseases, vaccines, and biological countermeasures. The Department of Homeland Security established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, to analyze pathogens for identifying biological attack perpetrators. Permanent facilities, including BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratories, are under construction for bioforensic and threat assessment activities. The National Bioforensics Analysis Center is part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, currently located at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD. Permanent facilities, including a BSL-4 laboratory and several BSL-3 laboratories, are under construction and expected to be fully operational in 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which is now establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace it. The NBAF will focus on researching pathogens affecting animals. The DHS is replacing the PIADC with the NBAF, a BSL-4 laboratory in Kansas. The NBAF will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The DHS announced the decision to site the NBAF in Kansas, which will be a BSL-4 laboratory focusing on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. Additionally, the HHS maintains BSL-4 laboratories at the NIH in Bethesda, MD, and at the CDC in Atlanta, GA, with investments in constructing NBLs and RBLs across the US for clinical and laboratory research on pathogens to support biodefense research efforts. The NIH is constructing NBLs and RBLs across the US for biodefense research. The HHS has developed the LRN, a network of laboratories for public health emergencies. The LRN is a network of laboratories for public health emergencies, including federal and state facilities, medical institutions, and others. These labs conduct diagnostic and public health testing, especially in emergency situations requiring additional capacity. The USDA is building new BSL-3 laboratories for research, including facilities in Ames, IA, and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are also investing in high-containment lab facilities for various purposes. The USDA is constructing new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are also investing in high-containment lab facilities to increase their ability to compete for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Universities like the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are examples of those building additional BSL-3 laboratory space. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also maintain high-containment lab facilities. The University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are examples of academic institutions investing in high-containment lab facilities to compete for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also have high-containment lab facilities for medical testing and product development purposes. Some companies choose to have in-house high-containment labs, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises policy issues for policymakers. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised policy issues for policymakers, including determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, balancing desire for capacity with increased risk, international ramifications, and local concerns. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers realized the existing infrastructure was insufficient, leading to the decision to construct additional high-containment laboratory space. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space due to insufficient existing infrastructure. The decision to construct more facilities required federal investment and support, with concerns about over-building capacity and the need to fully utilize resources. Policymakers made decisions without a national needs assessment or coordinated expansion plan, leading to concerns about the new high-containment laboratory. Decisions to build high-containment laboratories were made without a national needs assessment or coordinated plan, leading to concerns about exceeding national capacity. Lack of information on existing laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning. Estimates suggest a high number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, but the accuracy has been criticized. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but its survey had a low response rate. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, criticized by experts. Registration with select agents does not always indicate high-containment lab use. Nongovernmental estimates show increased high-containment lab capability. The Government Accountability Office noted an increase in high-containment laboratory capability, but was unable to determine the exact number of BSL-3 laboratories. There is a need for a government-wide assessment to determine if ongoing construction has surpassed national needs. Congress may need to consider conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body to address the continued construction of high-containment facilities and capacity utilization concerns. The construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding. Agencies may struggle with justifying larger research budgets to cover the costs of operations and maintenance for expanded facilities. A large increase in high containment laboratory capacity may lead to higher operations and maintenance costs, prompting agencies to seek larger research budgets. Interagency federal planning efforts could help manage overcapacity costs, but require agreement on facility prioritization and shared use. Individual agency initiatives may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies, such as DHS's coordination of homeland security research not addressing use of other agency assets. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Congress may need to decide on central coordination or agency-level coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. The use of high-containment laboratories requires central coordination or agency-level oversight. Concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation have led to a reexamination of the current oversight framework. Some experts suggest the need for additional federal regulations, such as mandatory biosafety training and broader biosecurity measures. Some experts propose expanding regulations for high-containment laboratories, including mandatory biosafety training and broader biosecurity measures. Others argue for an enhanced self-regulatory approach, focusing on increased worker engagement and responsibility, with more robust self-policing and training in best practices. The expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity has benefits such as enabling diverse biodefense research and more efficient public health sample testing, but also raises concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity has benefits like enabling diverse biodefense research and more efficient public health sample testing. However, it also raises concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security and address theft of dangerous pathogens. Investigations have revealed more facilities registering to possess select agents. The Select Agent Program has been augmented to enhance physical security of stored pathogens in high-containment facilities. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses at some facilities, and regulatory focus on compliance could help prevent such events. Despite planning for safety, accidents can still occur in high-containment laboratories. The GAO has testified on these issues. High-containment laboratories are designed to minimize accidents, but they still occur and can overwhelm safety controls. The GAO has testified that each facility has inherent risks, which increase as more facilities are built. The incremental risk is hard to measure and depends on compliance with regulations. Factors like accidental releases, subsequent illness, and the number of laboratories contribute to the risk. Policymakers may need to rely on approximate cost/benefit analysis due to limited information availability. Policymakers may need to rely on approximate cost/benefit analysis due to limited information availability when assessing the risks associated with high-containment laboratories. Factors such as accidental releases, subsequent illness, and the total number of laboratories contribute to the risk. The potential benefits of research breakthroughs in biodefense, like vaccines, must be weighed against the potential costs of infectious releases, such as the loss of infected animals or infection of laboratory workers. Subtle effects, like the development of a national sampling laboratory network, also play a role in the overall risk assessment. Breakthroughs in biodefense research, such as vaccines against high-containment pathogens, are seen as beneficial. However, the potential costs, like the loss of infected animals or infection of lab workers, must also be considered. Federal policymakers may overlook subtle effects, such as the development of a national sampling laboratory network, leading to policy decisions driven by high-profile incidents rather than actual risk assessment. Another concern is personnel surety, as the expansion of high-containment labs increases the risk of individuals with malicious intent receiving training in high-containment techniques. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the potential for malicious intent among trained technicians and scientists. The DOJ has cited the 2001 anthrax mailings as an example of the risks associated with individuals skilled in high-containment techniques. The increase in high-containment capacity may also have international implications, with other countries potentially viewing it as excessive for biodefense and health research purposes. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity may lead to international concerns about the U.S. potentially developing offensive biological weapons. This perception could harm U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention and may prompt other countries to build similar facilities, increasing the risk of misuse of high-containment techniques. The expansion of high-containment laboratory infrastructure in the U.S. may prompt other countries to build similar facilities, leading to international availability of high-containment techniques. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could influence multinational corporations to locate research facilities elsewhere, impacting national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies often locate their research and production facilities in other countries, which could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of disease treatments may face restricted access to countermeasures during international health crises. Differences in biosecurity regulations have led some U.S. scientists to limit international collaborations, potentially hindering the scientific process. Some U.S. scientists are limiting international collaborations due to differences in biosecurity regulations between countries. This may have a chilling effect on the scientific process and lead to barriers in research and industry investment. The impact of biosecurity regulations on international collaboration remains unclear, but the presence of U.S. standards could influence other countries to develop similar policies. Local resistance varies towards the construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States. The presence of U.S. biosecurity standards may influence international partners to adopt similar policies. Local communities have differing opinions on the construction of high-containment laboratories, with some supporting the economic benefits while others oppose them due to public health and security concerns. The construction of high-containment laboratories is a topic of debate in local communities. Some support the economic benefits it will bring, while others oppose it due to public health and security concerns. Policymakers have options to consider, such as maintaining current efforts, waiting for expert panel reports, or increasing oversight of facilities and personnel. Policymakers have options to consider regarding oversight of high-containment laboratories. They could maintain current efforts, wait for expert panel reports, or increase oversight of facilities and personnel. Balancing security controls with research productivity is crucial, as there are trade-offs between reducing terrorist threats and hindering scientific progress. The scientific community supports measures to reduce terrorist threats from acquiring deadly pathogens, but opposes measures that hinder research progress. Policymakers may find current oversight of high-containment laboratories sufficient, with some supporting no additional action. Some argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists is more effective than securing labs. Supporters argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists and disrupting their activities may be more effective than securing high-containment laboratories in the United States. They suggest allocating resources to develop intelligence on bioterror groups and their needs for a lower total cost. Concerned policymakers may defer action until they have a fuller understanding of policy options and impacts. The Bush Administration established expert groups to examine biosafety and biosecurity issues since 2005. Congress may choose to defer action on oversight of biosafety and biosecurity issues until expert groups have completed their investigations and made recommendations. This could involve endorsing the groups' activities while awaiting results. Some policymakers may find these efforts insufficient and require further action. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, is tasked with reviewing and evaluating existing biosecurity measures. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, established in December 2007, is charged with reviewing and evaluating existing laws and regulations related to biosafety and biosecurity. Recommendations to the President are due in July 2009. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, formed in December 2007, is developing recommendations to address gaps in biosafety oversight at high-containment laboratories. Co-chaired by HHS and USDA, the task force includes staff from various government departments and agencies. Recommendations will be presented to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research, oversight frameworks, a code of conduct, and biosafety training programs. The Board includes members from federal agencies and departments, with ongoing analysis and recommendations. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on biosafety oversight. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is working on policies for dual-use research, oversight frameworks, a code of conduct, and biosafety training programs. The GAO is set to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential recommendations for legislative and executive action. Congress may choose to wait for these recommendations or address the issues sooner. Congress may consider waiting for the results of studies on high-containment laboratories by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity and the GAO before taking action. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of these laboratories have been inconclusive, prompting calls for a comprehensive inventory. Alternatively, Congress may decide to address the issue without waiting for reports. Multiple sources have called for a comprehensive inventory of high-containment laboratories, including non-federal facilities in various locations. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to identify all existing facilities and their capacity. Concerns about industrial competitiveness and reporting burden may hinder accurate reporting. Efforts to incentivize self-reporting or mandate registration of all high-containment laboratories, public and private, could help create a comprehensive inventory. This registry would provide the government with information on the total available facilities. One approach to creating a comprehensive inventory of high-containment laboratories is to mandate registration with the federal government, potentially providing information on capacity, use, and distribution. Another option is to limit the survey to federal facilities, which could be required to report their information. One option to efficiently plan for high-containment laboratory capacity is to require federal facilities to report their information to Congress. This could help the government assess needs and allocate resources effectively. Comparing the needs assessment with existing federal capacity can determine if there is an excess capacity. The government may benefit from a needs assessment to efficiently allocate resources for high-containment laboratory capacity. Comparing this assessment with existing federal capacity can help determine if there is an excess capacity, which could lead to resource allocation costs and security concerns. Congress should consider the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories and weigh the benefits of such a survey against the quality and utility of the information acquired. Additionally, comparing the survey results with a needs assessment, currently unavailable across federal agencies, could maximize the benefits. The economic costs of conducting a needs assessment for high-containment laboratories under different reporting frameworks are being considered by policymakers. Some have suggested a moratorium on new laboratory construction to avoid excess capacity and prioritize research funding. A government-wide capacity needs assessment is currently lacking, which could impact resource allocation and security concerns. In considering a moratorium on new laboratory construction, policymakers must weigh the benefits of building the right amount of laboratory capacity against the potential costs to research and other priorities. Without a government-wide capacity needs assessment, there is a risk of over-building or redundancy in laboratory operations. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. The construction of new laboratories may not be necessary as existing laboratory space could be expanded to meet capacity needs. Some agencies argue that their infrastructure is outdated and not suitable for expansion, but without a government-wide assessment, potential synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. A construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet its needs. Enacting a construction moratorium could hinder the federal government's ability to meet national goals, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability. Delays in constructing laboratory facilities may impact planned research activities. Analysts warn that a moratorium may impede the development of necessary capabilities identified by advisory panels. The establishment of a permanent bioforensics capability and expansion of high-containment laboratory facilities could be delayed or hindered. Analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations. One approach is to apply Select Agent Program requirements to all high-containment laboratories. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements, ensuring compliance with security regulations. Another option is to establish a separate licensing program with flexible requirements based on the presence of select agents. Challenges may arise in implementing and gaining acceptance for laboratory licensing and certification mandates. Establishing a separately administered program for laboratory licensing could provide flexibility in requirements, especially for high-containment facilities handling select agents. However, challenges exist in implementing and gaining acceptance for these mandates. A more comprehensive approach would involve overseeing all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment to ensure regulatory coverage for all locations of concern. A comprehensive approach to overseeing laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment is proposed, which would capture all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. However, this approach would lead to overseeing a significantly increased number of facilities, including public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Another approach could involve expanding the select agent list to focus on pathogens of concern rather than facilities. Expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever could lead to more high-containment facilities being regulated. Some experts argue that the current Select Agent Program does not capture all potentially dangerous pathogens. Some pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, and yellow fever are being considered for inclusion in the Select Agent Program, raising concerns among scientists about the current taxonomic-based definition of select agents hindering research. The NIH has requested the National Academies to explore identifying select agents based on other features beyond taxonomy. The NIH has asked the National Academies to determine scientific advances needed to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. This approach would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, potentially limiting disruption to scientific development and public health activities. Background checks for personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded. The government could focus regulatory efforts on high-containment laboratories posing the greatest risk by expanding background checks for personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities. Different levels of background screening may be required for access to high-containment facilities without select agents, depending on the evaluation of potential risks. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification. Some scientists may choose to leave research fields requiring high-containment laboratories rather than undergo required government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than those needed for access to select agents. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may be met with resistance from some scientists who may prefer to leave research fields rather than obtain government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than required for access to select agents. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training before accessing select agents, with training tailored to individual needs and work risks. Developing training standards could help ensure consistency and quality. The regulations for worker training at high-containment facilities emphasize addressing individual needs, work risks, and the specific select agents or toxins. Experts suggest expanding biosafety training programs to meet current demand, with potential structures ranging from voluntary local training to mandatory federal certification. The impact of such training on reducing laboratory-acquired infections is challenging to evaluate. Enhanced biosafety training, including considerations for biosecurity and dual-use pathogens, is recommended for high-containment laboratory workers to address potential vulnerabilities. Lessons from incidents can inform future training improvements. The nature of pathogens handled in high-containment laboratories may address biosecurity concerns and promote a better understanding among workers. Lessons from accidents can help improve safety protocols. Reporting mechanisms are essential for sharing information and learning from others' experiences, but barriers like fear of penalties or professional repercussions may hinder reporting. The potential disincentives for reporting events involving select agents include fear of penalties, loss of stature, and embarrassment. Enhancing the reporting system with a database of accidents and remediation could help prevent future incidents. A database of accidents and remediation could enhance the reporting system for events involving select agents, potentially preventing future incidents. Experts recommend minimizing penalties for reporting to encourage participation, but policymakers must balance oversight with regulatory burden. Congress must consider the balance between oversight and regulatory burden in the Select Agent Program to address negligence and potential misuse of biological weapons. Increasing federal oversight may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders, with benefits mainly seen in reducing opportunities for misuse. However, expanding the program could hinder public health response and international collaboration. Expanding the Select Agent Program to include more laboratories or pathogens may hinder public health response and international collaboration by increasing barriers to timely material transfer between high-containment labs. Critics argue that the program's requirements for lab and personnel certification could impede successful collaboration, impacting public health response negatively. International cooperation on regulated pathogens in public health and scientific research could also be affected. Expanding the Select Agent Program to include more laboratories or pathogens may hinder public health response and international collaboration. The requirements for lab and personnel certification could impede successful collaboration, impacting public health response negatively. International cooperation on regulated pathogens in public health and scientific research could also be affected, leading to increased barriers and costs for regulated entities. Expanding the Select Agent Program to include more laboratories or pathogens may hinder public health response and international collaboration. The licensure requirement could reduce scientific productivity in academic and industrial sectors, while public health laboratories and hospitals may face increased costs. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency is a key issue, with USDA and HHS being deemed suitable regulators due to their technical knowledge and relationship with the scientific community. The focus historically has been on laboratory worker safety and minimizing the risk of pathogen accidental release. Policymakers may consider DHS as a more appropriate agency for biosafety and biosecurity programs due to increased homeland security concerns. Oversight could be conducted by the agency with existing statutory authority or a new authority may be developed, leading to a potential mixture of oversight responsibilities. If policymakers choose to develop new authorities for biosafety and biosecurity programs, oversight responsibilities may be divided between agencies. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and deciding on consolidation of oversight into one agency could facilitate implementation. Limited federal resources have been allocated to overseeing voluntary adoption of biosafety practices, but expanding the scope for high-containment laboratories may require increased resources even under a non-mandatory program. Additional funding or staffing may be necessary. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address oversight responsibilities for biosafety practices in high-containment laboratories. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for determining select agents. Additional funding and staffing may be required for agencies to meet new mandates. The bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization and expand criteria for select agents. They require the National Academy of Sciences to review the program, mandate biosafety training for access to select agents, and call for improvements in monitoring and inventory procedures. The HHS Secretary, in consultation with the USDA Secretary, must evaluate current and planned capacity for sharing lessons learned in biodefense. The bills require the HHS Secretary to issue guidance on improving select agent monitoring and inventory procedures, evaluate laboratory capacity, share lessons learned in biodefense, streamline guidance on laboratory infrastructure, and establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories. The Secretary is directed to establish the Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for reporting biosafety incidents. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs. The bill also requires a report to Congress on integrating the RBL network and the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity. Biocontainment technologies are used globally by scientists. The integration of the RBL network and the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity to respond to biodefense or emerging infectious disease emergencies globally is crucial. International harmonization is necessary to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being the source of bioterror weapons. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight of these laboratories, which can impact policy decisions. A registry of high-containment laboratory capacity may aid in planning and coordination but may offer limited security benefits. The choice of goal in overseeing high-containment laboratories can impact policy decisions. Options such as a registry of existing capacity or a rigorous oversight program have varying security benefits and regulatory burdens. Policymakers must balance national needs when considering these complex policy issues."
