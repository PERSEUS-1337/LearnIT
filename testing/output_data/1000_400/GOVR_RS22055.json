    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for children with disabilities, requiring a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and due process provisions. Attorneys' fees provisions were added in 1986 and amended in 1997. The Handicapped Children's Protection Act, P.L. 99-372, added attorneys' fees provisions in 1986, later amended in 1997. The 2004 IDEA amendments addressed attorneys' fees, with the House and Senate bills proposing different approaches. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization included changes to attorneys' fees provisions, with the House and Senate bills proposing different approaches. The final law allowed attorneys' fees for the state or local educational agency against the parent or their attorney in certain situations. The new law maintained general provisions on filing complaints and appeals, with the addition that the local educational agency can also file a complaint. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to the state or local educational agency (SEA/LEA) against the parent or their attorney in specific situations. Complaints can be filed regarding identification, evaluation, placement, education provision, or alternative placement, leading to an impartial due process hearing and the right to appeal. Reasonable attorneys' fees may be awarded to the prevailing party, including the SEA/LEA or the parent of a child with a disability. Additionally, attorneys' fees can be awarded against a parent's attorney in certain circumstances. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to the state or local educational agency (SEA/LEA) against the parent or their attorney in specific situations, such as when the complaint is frivolous or for an improper purpose. Senator Grassley highlighted the importance of the attorneys' fees amendment during the Senate debate. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded against the attorney of a parent of a child with a disability or a parent to a prevailing SEA or LEA if the complaint was for an improper purpose. Senator Grassley emphasized the importance of the attorneys' fees amendment during the Senate debate. Senator Gregg highlighted the need for the attorneys' fee amendment, citing the precedent set by the Supreme Court in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The standard for prevailing defendants to recover attorneys' fees is high, with defendants rarely meeting the criteria due to the stringent requirements. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stated that prevailing defendants should be able to recover attorneys' fees if a plaintiff's actions are frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. Senator Gregg emphasized the high standard for prevailing defendants to obtain fee reimbursement and the consideration of the plaintiff's financial resources. The provision also allows for fee recovery if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, following the objective reasonableness standard from Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The provision allows defendants to recover attorneys' fees if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, based on the objective reasonableness standard from Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fees are based on prevailing community rates with specific prohibitions and limitations on fee awards. Fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer under certain circumstances. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded in certain circumstances, such as when a written offer of settlement is not accepted within ten days or if the relief obtained by parents is not more favorable than the offer. Additionally, attorneys' fees are not allowed for meetings of the individualized education program (IEP) team unless convened due to an administrative proceeding, judicial action, or mediation. The 2004 reauthorization also introduced a \"resolution session\" requirement before a due process hearing. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded in certain circumstances, such as when a written offer of settlement is not accepted within ten days or if the relief obtained by parents is not more favorable than the offer. The 2004 reauthorization added a requirement for a \"resolution session\" before a due process hearing, where attorneys' fees are not allowable. P.L. 108-446 specifies that attorneys' fees may be awarded to a prevailing parent if they were substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer, with possible reductions in certain circumstances. Attorneys' fees may be reduced if the court finds that the parent or their attorney unreasonably prolonged the resolution, fees exceed prevailing rates, time spent was excessive, or if the attorney did not provide necessary information in the due process complaint. This includes the child's name, address, school, description of the problem, and proposed resolution. P.L. 108-446 specifies conditions for awarding attorneys' fees to prevailing parents who were justified in rejecting a settlement offer. The school district must provide specific information in the due process complaint, including the child's details, description of the issue, and proposed resolution. Attorneys' fees under P.L. 108-446 may be reduced if the SEA or LEA unreasonably delays resolution or violates the law. Department of Education regulations were issued in 2006, with limited guidance on statutory interpretation. The final regulations for P.L. 108-446 were issued on August 14, 2006 by the Department of Education (ED), which declined to provide further guidance on statutory language interpretation. One issue not addressed was whether non-attorney advocates could receive fees for assisting parents at due process hearings, with ED stating that lay advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys. The Department of Education (ED) declined to award fees to non-attorney advocates who assisted parents at due process hearings, citing that lay advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys. The Supreme Court's decision in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy was referenced, stating that explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents was not included in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA. As a result, ED did not add a regulatory provision on the subject."
