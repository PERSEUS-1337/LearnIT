    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading. The Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights nutrient removal technology as an effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in wastewater discharge. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program prioritizes eligible facilities for installing technologies to reduce total nutrients in wastewater discharge, focusing on achieving the greatest nutrient load reductions at discharge points, environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and meeting specific objectives. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program prioritizes facilities for reducing total nutrients in wastewater discharge to achieve load reductions at discharge points, environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and meet objectives outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. States or municipalities can apply for grants by submitting the required information to the Administrator. If approved, the Administrator will grant the application. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program allows states or municipalities to apply for grants by submitting an application to the Administrator. If approved, a grant of up to 55 percent of the installation cost of nutrient removal technologies can be awarded. The program aligns with the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day. The subsection authorizes $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 for municipal wastewater treatment facilities with a capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day in the Great Lakes System. Authorized under this section, $100,000,000 is appropriated for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 for municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the Great Lakes System. The Administrator may use up to 4 percent for administrative costs."
