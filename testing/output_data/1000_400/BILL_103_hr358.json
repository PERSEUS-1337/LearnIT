The Congress finds that law enforcement officers face increasing challenges in the war against drugs and crime, with a rise in violent crime and drug use. The support from the Federal Government has not kept pace with these evolving problems, and a review is needed to address current issues affecting law enforcement. The Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice of 1965 highlighted various issues impacting law enforcement, including drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased funding. A comprehensive study on law enforcement matters, such as the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers, working conditions, and crime control responsibilities, would help redefine relationships between the government, the public, and law enforcement officials. A national commission called the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement\" is established. The Commission's duties are outlined. The National Commission to Support Law Enforcement will study and recommend changes related to law enforcement agencies and issues at the Federal, State, and local levels, including funding, employment conditions, information-sharing systems, research and training, equipment and resources, and cooperation among different law enforcement agencies. The National Commission to Support Law Enforcement will study law enforcement research, training, equipment, resources, cooperation among agencies, responsibility in solving crime, and the impact of the criminal justice system. The Commission will consult with law enforcement officers, local officials, and community leaders nationwide to gather information and advice on important law enforcement issues. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP.
