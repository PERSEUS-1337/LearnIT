Congress recognizes the toxicity of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It highlights the risks posed to pregnant women and unborn babies from mercury exposure. The main source of mercury exposure in the US is contaminated fish. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to reduce global mercury use and releases to lower contamination levels in the environment, rather than reducing fish consumption. Mercury pollution is a global issue with long-term solutions focused on reducing global mercury use and releases. Contaminated fish is a major concern, but reducing fish consumption is not the solution as uncontaminated fish is a critical source of nutrition. Mercury pollution affects bodies of water worldwide, from industrial areas like the Great Lakes to remote areas like the Arctic Circle. In the US, there are approximately 30 plants contributing to mercury pollution. Mercury pollution is deposited locally, regionally, and globally, affecting bodies of water near industrial areas like the Great Lakes and remote areas like the Arctic Circle. In the US, only 8 out of 30 plants producing chlorine use the obsolete mercury cell chlor-alkali process, with 5 plants yet to phase out mercury use. Cost-effective alternatives are available for the remaining 90% of chlorine and caustic soda production. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States primarily relies on the mercury cell chlor-alkali process for chlorine and caustic soda production, despite cost-effective alternatives being available for 90% of production. Other countries, like Japan, have already banned this process due to mercury contamination concerns. The industry acknowledges that mercury can contaminate products and lead to direct and indirect mercury releases, but neither the industry nor the Environmental Protection Agency has been able to address the issue effectively. Despite the known use of mercury in chlor-alkali facilities, there is a lack of accountability for its disposition and accurate estimation of current emissions. It is crucial for the United States to aggressively work towards minimizing the supply, demand, and releases of mercury domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions, as well as exposures to mercury, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, an amendment is proposed to regulate the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Effective January 1, 2012, the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the Administrator and State identifying their operations. Effective January 1, 2012, the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the Administrator and State detailing the types and quantities of mercury-containing hazardous waste generated, along with how it was managed and any mercury releases. The annual reports from chlor-alkali facilities must include details on the mercury content of wastes, how each waste was managed, offsite locations for waste transportation, volume of mercury released into air or water, and volume of mercury accumulated in plant equipment. The annual reports from chlor-alkali facilities must include details on the mercury content of wastes, how each waste was managed, offsite waste transportation locations, volume of mercury released into air or water, and volume of mercury accumulated in plant equipment. The owner or operator may combine this report with any required under the Solid Waste Disposal Act to avoid duplication. The Administrator may allow chlor-alkali facility owners to combine required reports with those under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, a comprehensive mercury inventory must be conducted within a year, covering mercury purchases and usage during the facility's lifespan. The Administrator, in consultation with the State, must conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities, including total mercury purchased, remaining mercury at closure, estimated mercury in waste and products, and aggregate mercury releases. The Administrator will obtain records and information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine mercury releases into the environment. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established with 9 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader. One member will serve as the Chairperson of the Committee. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including 2 jointly appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, with one designated as Chairperson and the other as Vice-Chairperson. Other members include the Administrator, Secretary of Defense, a representative of State environmental agencies, and a representative of. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee comprises 9 members, including the Administrator, Secretary of Defense, State environmental agencies representative, State attorneys general representative, chlorine industry representative, mercury waste treatment industry representative, and a nonprofit environmental organization representative. Appointments must be made within 45 days of the section's enactment. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including representatives from the chlorine industry and mercury waste treatment industry, as well as a nonprofit environmental organization. Appointments must be made within 45 days of the section's enactment, with the Committee holding its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members constitutes a quorum. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members will constitute a quorum. The Committee is required to submit a report to Congress within 1 year, detailing findings and recommendations on preventing the release of elemental mercury into the environment and worker exposure during storage. The Committee will report on environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, estimated storage costs, optimal Federal facility sizes, and the quantity of elemental mercury over a 40-year period. The report will include details on the optimal size and characteristics of Federal facilities for storing elemental mercury, estimated quantities resulting from discontinuing mercury cells at chlor-alkali facilities, and the amount generated from recycling over a 40-year period. The report will also address any barriers preventing the private sector from storing elemental mercury produced during a 40-year period, including measures to overcome these barriers. The report will cover barriers to private sector storage of elemental mercury, advantages of consolidating storage, optimal storage plans, and additional research needed for long-term disposal options. The Committee will address barriers to private sector storage of mercury, optimal storage plans, and compensation for non-federal members. Members of the Committee who are federal government officers or employees will be compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level V of the Executive Schedule. Federal employees serving on the Committee will not receive additional compensation beyond their regular pay. Members of the Committee who are federal government officers or employees shall serve without additional compensation. They will be allowed travel expenses and per diem while performing Committee duties. The Administrator will provide funding and personnel to the Committee. The Committee will receive necessary funding and personnel from the Administrator to carry out its duties. It will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transferring and storing mercury at chlor-alkali facilities will be established by the Administrator by July 1, 2008. The Administrator will establish regulations by July 1, 2008, for transferring and storing mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities. Elemental mercury at closed facilities must be transferred to a storage facility by that date. Additionally, a health assessment for operating chlor-alkali facilities must be completed by July 1, 2009. The Administrator will establish regulations for transferring and storing mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2008.
