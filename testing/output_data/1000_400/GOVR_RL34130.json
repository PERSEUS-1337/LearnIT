Interest in renewable energy has increased due to rising petroleum prices and biofuels production, with agriculture-based biofuels seen as a way to boost rural economies and reduce energy import dependence. The 2008 farm bill reflects the increased role of biofuels in response to rising energy prices and production, with significant federal support for ethanol and biodiesel. It aligns with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, emphasizing the production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks. The 2008 farm bill aligns with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, emphasizing biofuel production from cellulosic feedstocks. EISA mandates an overall Renewable Fuels Standard of 36 billion gallons by 2022, with specific targets for biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. Concerns about economic and environmental issues related to corn starch-based ethanol have led to a focus on cellulosic ethanol. The emphasis on cellulosic ethanol reflects concerns about economic and environmental issues associated with corn starch-based ethanol. Ethanol production in 2010 used nearly 40% of U.S. corn production, leading to competition with petroleum in the marketplace. The profitability of ethanol depends on petroleum and corn prices, with the \"food versus fuel\" debate intensifying during the 2008 farm bill debate. The production of ethanol from corn has led to a decrease in U.S. corn stocks and an increase in prices. Ethanol's profitability is influenced by petroleum and corn prices, with higher petroleum prices driving up demand for ethanol and corn. The debate over \"food versus fuel\" intensified during the 2008 farm bill discussions due to rising food prices globally. Federal programs supporting renewable energy, like the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), originated outside of the farm bill and are not under the USDA's jurisdiction. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not oversee federal programs supporting renewable energy, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). These programs, like the RFS and federal tax credits for biofuel blenders, have legislative origins outside of the farm bill. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expanded programs to support biofuels production and use, including a distinct energy title (Title IX). The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expanded programs to support biofuels production and use, including a distinct energy title (Title IX) with provisions for corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for renewable energy in Title VII and tax and trade in Title XV. Title IX remains unchanged from the Senate-passed version and includes 3 sections with new biofuels-related provisions such as a cellulosic ethanol production tax credit and support for cellulosic feedstocks production. The 2008 farm bill includes key biofuels-related provisions such as a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production, grants and loan guarantees for biofuels research and production, incentivizing production of cellulosic ethanol feedstock, studies on market and environmental impacts of biofuels use, support for rural energy efficiency, and reauthorization of biofuels research programs within USDA and DOE. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for promoting bio-based products, rural energy efficiency, biofuels research programs, and biodiesel education. It offers financial incentives for advanced biofuels production and supports the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides $1 billion in financial incentives to promote advanced biofuels production, including grants and loan guarantees for new technologies and infrastructure. Programs like BCAP support dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks, while the Biorefinery Assistance program assists in constructing advanced biofuels refineries. Increased funding for research is also provided under the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative. The Biorefinery Assistance program (Section 9001) provides grants and loans for commercial-scale refineries to produce advanced biofuels. Funding for advanced biofuels research is increased under programs like the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative (Section 7207) and the Sun Grant Program (Section 7526). Cellulosic ethanol is produced from plant structural materials like cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin. Various agricultural products can serve as feedstock, including prairie grasses and fast-growing woody crops. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plant structural material. Various agricultural products like prairie grasses and fast-growing woody crops can serve as feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production. Native prairie grasses offer environmental benefits over corn-based ethanol as they thrive on marginal lands and require little water or fertilizer. Currently, cellulosic ethanol is not produced on a commercial scale, with only a few small refineries operating. Some cellulosic feedstock, like native prairie grasses, offer environmental benefits over corn-based ethanol due to their ability to thrive on marginal lands with minimal water and fertilizer. Cellulosic ethanol production is limited, with only a few small refineries operating on a pilot scale. The slow progress has led the EPA to reduce cellulosic biofuel mandates set by Congress for the years 2010 through 2012. The 2008 farm bill extends tax credits and tariffs on ethanol, including a producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic ethanol. The ethanol blender tax credit was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in 2009. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to 2010. Congress reduced cellulosic biofuel mandates for 2010-2012. The ethanol blender tax credit of $0.51 per gallon was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in January 2009. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to the end of 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended both the ethanol blender tax credit and the import tariff for ethanol. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff for ethanol until the end of 2011. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies was debated during the farm bill process. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of increased ethanol production on the economy, environment, and food prices. Studies like the Comprehensive Study of Biofuels and Biofuels Infrastructure Study will be conducted by various agencies. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program requires an assessment of the economic impacts of expanded biomass production. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for various biofuel programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development. This funding is a significant increase compared to the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill authorizes significant funding for biofuel programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development. Mandatory funding totals over $1 billion, with discretionary funding totaling over $1.7 billion, a substantial increase from the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill provisions total over $1.7 billion, with a significant increase from the 2002 farm bill. The Biorefinery Assistance Program sees a substantial increase in funding, mainly through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. Mandatory funding is provided for identified programs, while discretionary programs are funded annually through the appropriations process. Table 2 outlines the provisions in the 2008 farm bill's energy title and selected energy programs for FY2010 through FY2012, showing mandatory and discretionary funding levels."
