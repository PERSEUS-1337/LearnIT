The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing past pandemics like the bubonic plague and the 1918 influenza outbreak. Disparities in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries are increasing, potentially leading to a significant rise in child mortality by 2010 in the most affected regions. The transmission of HIV from mother to child is increasing, posing a threat to child survival in developing countries. UNAIDS predicts a significant increase in AIDS-related child mortality by 2010 in the most affected regions. The number of AIDS orphans worldwide is expected to triple in the next 10 years, leading to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization.
