    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certifications. Demand exists for workers in jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree, such as skilled electrical work and health care support services. There is demand for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but need training or postsecondary education, such as skilled electrical work and health care support services. Some traditional colleges are exploring creative ways to increase enrollment and revenue, including reaching out to adults. However, the majority of federal financial aid for postsecondary education is not accessible to individuals pursuing non-degree programs. The majority of federal financial aid for postsecondary education is not available to individuals pursuing non-degree programs. Some traditional colleges are looking for creative ways to increase enrollment, including reaching out to adults. Congress may consider providing direct federal support to students in non-degree programs. Several proposals have been made to increase federal support for students in short-term programs. Congress may consider providing direct federal support to students pursuing non-degree programs, with proposals to increase Pell Grants for short-term education. The College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers suggested options to reskill adults for the changing economy to boost economic growth. The Higher Education Act may be reauthorized to include more non-degree programs for Pell Grants. The President's Council of Economic Advisers proposed options to reskill adults for the changing economy, including expanding Pell Grants for short-term training programs. Some stakeholders support extending Pell Grants to shorter programs, but concerns about promotion exist. The President's FY2021 budget request for ED proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs that are not currently Pell-eligible. Some stakeholders support this idea, but concerns exist about the quality and cost of these programs, as well as the potential impact on income inequalities. Some concerns about expanding Pell Grants to non-degree programs include ensuring program quality, high federal costs, need for student supports, and potential perpetuation of income inequalities. Questions have been raised about diminishing labor market returns for some non-degree programs and employer preferences for degree holders. Employers are increasingly relying on degrees for hiring, which may disadvantage non-degree holders in securing employment. Adults with degrees in positions not requiring a degree may also crowd out non-degree holders. Federal programs support individuals in non-degree training and education. In 2018, 28% of employment required a degree, while 42% of adults had a degree. The report discusses federal programs supporting non-degree training and education, including work-based learning programs. It also outlines employer demand for non-degree program graduates and details six federal programs and three tax benefits available. The report discusses the landscape and key characteristics of non-degree programs, including work-based learning and formal instructional means. It also details six federal programs and three tax benefits providing financial support to students in non-degree programs, highlighting gaps and limitations in support, eligibility requirements, and federal oversight. Key stimuli for promoting financial support include unfulfilled employer demand for non-degree program graduates. The report highlights gaps and limitations in financial support for individuals pursuing non-degree programs, emphasizing the importance of addressing employer demand for non-degree credentials. Data on employment proportions and wages by education requirements are provided to give insight into the market for non-degree credentials. In May 2018, around 6.2% of jobs in the national economy required a non-degree postsecondary credential for entry-level education. The mean annual wages for occupations with different entry-level education requirements are also provided in Table 1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) assigns typical entry-level education requirements for occupations it tracks. Mean annual wages for occupations with various education levels are similar at entry but can vary within categories. Research shows earnings premiums for certain certificates and postsecondary non-degree programs offer training. Postsecondary non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. These programs may include instructional training and work-based learning, with research showing earnings premiums for individuals attaining certificates in technical and health fields. Non-degree instructional programs offered by educational institutions prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate as a credential. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by awarding a postsecondary educational certificate upon completion. Individuals pursue these programs for various reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for further education, or seeking promotion. Transfer programs and postbaccalaureate certificates are excluded from non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree instructional programs do not include transfer programs or postbaccalaureate certificates. These programs provide education for at least two academic years and are acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree. They are different from certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials awarded by entities to assess competency in a specific occupation. Licenses are required for certain occupations, while certifications show competency attainment. Various entities offer non-degree instructional programs, including colleges and universities. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities, including traditional postsecondary educational institutions, trade schools, businesses, and professional organizations. In fall 2018, nearly 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students were enrolled in these programs. Additionally, there were over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions enrolling almost 670,000 students in AY 2009-2010. Certifications and licenses are required in certain occupations to demonstrate competency. Other entities, such as businesses, organizations, and governments, offer non-degree instructional programs with varying lengths. Program duration is influenced by curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills complexity. Some programs may be stackable and broken into units to meet educational hour requirements for employment or certification. The program duration is influenced by curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills complexity. It may be affected by federal, state, and private entities that require a minimum number of educational hours for eligibility. Programs can be offered in various formats and students are responsible for funding the cost, living expenses, and lost wages. Program cost varies based on length, resource requirements, and provider. Generally, students must find funding for program costs, living expenses, and lost wages. The average cost for tuition and fees in AY2018-2019 was over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and approximately $15,000 at private less-than-two-year colleges. Credit and noncredit courses may have the same vocational objective but differ in their credit offerings. Successful completion of credit courses and programs earns individuals credits. Credit courses and programs offer credits that can be transferred to other programs, while noncredit courses do not provide this option. Credit programs are approved by accrediting entities and may have stricter entrance requirements, leading to various vocations. Noncredit programs may offer CEUs or vocational certificates but do not contribute towards credit programs. Noncredit programs, although not offering credits towards other programs, are advantageous for being less expensive, covering a wider range of topics, and being more adaptable to industry and student needs. They can fulfill career entry requirements, provide ABE and ESL instruction, offer personal enrichment, and customized training. Noncredit programs cater to industry and student needs by offering vocational, ABE, ESL, and GED courses. Enrollment data is incomplete at the national level, with some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Some states and the federal government do not collect data on noncredit programs. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Educational institutions participating in federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees in AY2017-2018. Work-based learning refers to training activities that impart workplace skills to individuals. Work-based learning encompasses various training activities aimed at imparting workplace skills to individuals through time spent at an employer's worksite or simulated work location. It includes on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and other forms of experiential learning. Earn and learn programs provide wages or remuneration, while RA programs are a unique form of work-based learning recognized by the Department of Labor. Work-based learning programs, such as apprenticeships and internships, provide valuable on-the-job training experiences. RA programs, overseen by the Department of Labor, require registration and periodic reviews to ensure compliance with federal standards. Work-based learning programs involve a process schedule outlining competencies and training methods. Programs must be reviewed every five years for compliance, with possible deregistration for failure. Various entities can offer work-based learning, including employers, unions, training providers, and educational institutions. Work-based learning experiences can be offered by employers, labor unions, training providers, or educational institutions. These experiences are structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee, with programs like summer internships providing informal or formal training opportunities. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and typically last four years, with apprentices learning skills through completing a specified number of hours of on-the-job training. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs typically last four years and require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training. Programs can take a time-based or competency-based approach, with related instruction included. Program costs are primarily covered by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living expenses. The costs of work-based learning programs are mainly covered by the provider, but trainees may need to pay for living expenses. Program costs may include fees for trainers, trainee wages, and lost work time. Trainees may also have to cover related instruction costs. Work-based learners who do not receive remuneration must provide for their own transportation, room, and board. Data on work-based training are limited and vary in methodology and timeframe. The data on work-based or employer provided training are limited and vary in methodology. A summary of government surveys in the 1990s found that while most establishments offer training, the percentage of workers receiving training ranged from 16% to 70%. A 2016 survey showed that 21% of adults aged 16-65 had completed a work-based learning program. Different government surveys in the 1990s found that 16% to 70% of workers received training. In 2016, 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. The Department of Labor reported 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs in FY2019, with 81,000 completing a program. Construction has the highest number of apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. In FY2019, there were approximately 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs, with 81,000 completing a program.

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides career services for adults aged 18 or older. Training services are available for individuals who are unlikely to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, have the necessary skills for training, and cannot access other grant assistance. One-Stop operators assess and evaluate individuals for access to training services. Under WIOA, One-Stop operators assess individuals for training services, prioritizing public assistance recipients, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local WDBs determine fund allocation for career and training services, allowing for training through ITAs or contracts. Supportive services like childcare are also permitted. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs), in consultation with the state governor, have the discretion to allocate funds among priority groups for training services under WIOA. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts, with ITAs being the primary method. Supportive services like childcare and transportation are also allowed. Once deemed eligible for training, individuals can choose services from the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) with an ITA established for payment to the training provider. WDBs have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual needs. Local WDBs have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual needs. WIOA participants can use ITA funds for non-degree instructional and degree programs, as well as supportive services like transportation, child care, and housing to enable participation in training. Training can be provided through ITAs or contracts for services. Local WDBs can provide supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and payments for training participation. Training can be done through ITAs or contracts for services with employers or RA sponsors for occupational training in exchange for reimbursement. This option is used when consumer choice requirements are met, and there is a lack of training providers in the area. Local WDBs can provide supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and payments for training participation. Training services such as OJT, RA, customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment may be used if consumer choice requirements are met. The local WDB can determine the need for training providers in the area and may enter into contracts with employers or RA sponsors for reimbursement of up to 50% or 75% of wages for participants or apprentices. Local WDBs can reimburse OJT providers for up to 50% of participant wages, or 75% in limited cases. They can also contract with RA sponsors to reimburse up to 75% of apprentice wages. States develop the ETPL, while local WDBs and One-Stop operators manage training programs and payments to providers. Quality assurance for providers is ensured through eligibility processes. Governors and state WDBs establish criteria for funding eligible training providers in the local workforce. Quality assurance of training providers is established through initial and continued eligibility processes. The governor and state WDB in each state set criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in local workforce areas. RA programs are automatically eligible for the state ETPL. Non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility and follow procedures for continued eligibility. WIOA provides general requirements, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors. The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) determines initial eligibility for training providers for one fiscal year, with continued eligibility requiring submission of specified information. WIOA sets general requirements, but local WDBs have discretion on specific factors such as the duration of OJT contracts and employer eligibility for funding. The exact length of OJT contracts and criteria for employer eligibility are determined by the local WDB without establishing quantifiable targets. The local WDB determines the length of OJT contracts and employer eligibility for WIOA funding without specific targets. Providers must report participant outcomes every two years to maintain eligibility. RA programs are exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years to the governor for participants under WIOA Title I, including employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, cost of attendance, and completion rates. Additional performance information may be required for continued eligibility. The governor may require specific performance information for program participants, including postsecondary credentials received, cost of attendance, and completion rates. States must publish annual ETP performance reports with details on training services, participants, exits, and average cost per participant. The ETP performance reports must include data on participants in WIOA Title I programs, such as total number trained, exits, and average cost per participant. It should also detail participants with barriers to employment by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Initial data shows 955,094 adult and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in work-based learning. The first WIOA ETP performance report is pending, but data shows 955,094 adult and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in work-based learning. Most participants are over 30, unemployed, and lack postsecondary education. Some have a degree. Table 4 displays training service usage among program exiters in 2018, with fewer than 20% engaging in work-based learning. The majority pursue skills training. In program year 2018, WIOA Title I participants primarily engage in skills training or upgrading through non-degree programs with ITAs.

Recipients are subject to a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters for Pell Grant aid. Direct Loan program loans require students to be enrolled at least half-time. Additional eligibility criteria may be needed for specific loan types. Direct Loan program loans have specific eligibility criteria, including Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, can only borrow Direct Subsidized Loans for up to 150% of their program length. Title IV aid is limited by statutory rules, with aid amounts not exceeding the cost of attendance. Students who are new borrowers after July 1, 2013, are limited to borrowing Direct Subsidized Loans for a maximum of 150% of their academic program length. Title IV aid, including Pell Grants, is subject to statutory rules that cap the total aid amount at the cost of attendance. The Pell Grant award rules determine the grant amount without considering other financial assistance. The maximum Pell Grant award for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time students. Awards may be reduced based on various factors. Pell Grants for non-degree programs are generally taxable, while those for degree programs are taxable if used for non-tuition purposes. The amount of financial aid a student may receive can be affected by their cost of attendance, financial need, enrollment status, and program duration. Pell Grant awards for non-degree programs are usually taxable, while those for degree programs are taxable if used for non-tuition expenses. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type, and other factors can impact the aid awarded. Additionally, there are limits on the amount of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans a student can receive based on dependency status and class level. The Direct Loan program loans awarded to students must consider other financial assistance received.

Provisions ensure program and IHE quality, with a program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. The program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensures quality in Title IV-eligible programs and IHEs. State authorization provides consumer protection, accreditation ensures quality assurance, and ED certification oversees compliance. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. The Title IV programs require IHEs to meet state authorization and gainful employment requirements. State approval and licensure vary among states, with some evaluating individual educational programs. Some states require approval of individual educational programs, while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. States may evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Accreditation by a recognized agency is necessary for participation in Title IV programs. To participate in Title IV programs, an institution of higher education (IHE) must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education (ED). Accrediting agencies evaluate various aspects of the IHE, including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Regional or national accreditation is typically sufficient for Title IV program eligibility. Accrediting agencies evaluate an IHE based on criteria including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Regional or national accreditors assess the overall performance of an IHE, with the option to evaluate specific programs. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but may be sought to meet employer or licensure requirements. Educational programs are evaluated based on established standards for their field of study. An educational program offered by an IHE may seek programmatic accreditation to meet employer or licensure requirements. Programmatic accreditation evaluates whether the curriculum meets professional guidelines for the specific field of study. When seeking Title IV participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which reviews each program to ensure eligibility, including durational requirements and completion verification for Direct Loan programs. The IHE must meet Title IV participation requirements, including durational requirements and completion verification for Direct Loan programs. New educational programs can be added by self-certifying to ED or submitting an application for approval. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as per the HEA. The 2014 GE regulations, defining gainful employment, were rescinded in 2019. The Higher Education Act requires 300-599 clock-hour programs to apply to the Department of Education for approval. The 2014 Gainful Employment regulations, which aimed to measure program quality through debt-to-earnings rates, were rescinded in 2019. Programs failing to meet standards may lose Title IV eligibility for three years. Under the Gainful Employment framework, programs must meet debt-to-earnings rates to ensure quality and student loan repayment. Failure to meet standards can result in Title IV ineligibility for three years. Programs must also meet third-party standards for accreditation and licensure requirements. The Higher Education Act does not define performance measures for Title IV. The Higher Education Act requires Title IV participating institutions to report enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant information. Data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs is collected annually by the Department of Education. In the academic year 2017-2018, there were 6,418 Title IV-participating institutions, with 4,618 offering non-degree instructional for-credit programs. In AY2017-2018, 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating institutions offered non-degree for-credit programs. Private for-profit IHEs offer half of these programs, while public IHEs award over two-thirds of the credentials. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards, accounting for 10% of recipients and awards.

Eligibility excludes students without a high school diploma, those not in a career pathway program, Pell Grant recipients with a bachelor's degree, and Direct Loan program students enrolled less than half-time. Quality assessment of non-degree programs is primarily done through state authorizers and accreditors, with flexibility in criteria application. State authorization requirements and program quality assessment have been minimally studied. State authorizers and accreditors assess program quality with flexibility in criteria application. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements, noting variation among states as a complicating factor. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements. State authorizers and accreditors assess program quality with flexibility in criteria application. Researchers have pointed to potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements, including concerns about oversight, input requirements, elongated timeframes, conflicts across state laws, and challenges in assessing non-degree programs. The accreditation system has strengths and weaknesses related to program quality. Institutional accreditors tailor peer reviews based on school type and mission, while programmatic accreditation is aligned with specific fields. Weaknesses include conflicts of interest between institutions and conflicting state laws. The accreditation system has strengths such as tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment. Weaknesses include conflicts of interest, insufficient resources, and difficulty in assessing innovative education modes. Education tax benefits offset some higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, favoring upper middle-income individuals. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, offset higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, mainly benefiting upper middle-income individuals. Taxpayers claim these benefits when filing their federal income tax return, receiving the benefit after paying for education expenses. Some benefits are only available to degree program enrollees, while others have broader eligibility rules. Education tax benefits are received after paying for education expenses, with some benefits available to non-degree program enrollees. These benefits reduce federal revenues and are considered a form of \"spending through the tax code.\" Eligible individuals can claim these benefits when filing their federal income tax return, potentially leading to overconsumption of education. Tax benefits for education include the Lifetime Learning Credit, Employer Provided Educational Assistance, and 529 accounts. These benefits reduce tax liability and help with education expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit for 20% of the first $10,000 in qualifying expenses, phasing out for higher income taxpayers. Employer Provided Educational Assistance excludes eligible costs from taxable income. 529 accounts help save for educational expenses. Both the Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts can be used for non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible IHEs. Qualified education expenses for the credit include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment. Employer provided educational assistance can be used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for courses at a Title IV-eligible IHE. Expenses must be reduced by any tax-free educational assistance. Courses can be part of a post-secondary degree program or for job skills improvement. For LLC purposes, courses can be part of a post-secondary degree program or for job skills improvement.
