Over 30 PHAs are currently participating in MTW, managing billions in funding to support low-income families. The program aims to increase cost-effectiveness, promote self-sufficiency, and expand housing choices. The future of MTW is uncertain despite its significant impact on housing assistance programs. The Moving to Work (MTW) program, established in 1996, involves over 30 PHAs managing billions in funding to support low-income families. The future of MTW is uncertain, with calls for changes to the program emerging. Critics argue that MTW agencies have been given unprecedented flexibilities, with concerns about negative impacts on families. Supporters believe the program allows PHAs to serve more families in unique ways. The Moving to Work (MTW) program has generated conflicting views on its impact on low-income families. Supporters argue that the program's flexibility has allowed PHAs to serve more families effectively, while critics express concerns about negative impacts. Evaluating the program's effectiveness is challenging due to its design and implementation, leading to calls for ending, changing, or expanding the program. The MTW demonstration program's effectiveness and efficiency are difficult to evaluate against statutory goals, leading to conflicting views on its success. Some argue for restructuring to better serve its purpose, while others believe PHAs can operate successfully outside traditional regulations. Despite controversy, MTW policies have influenced discussions on housing reforms. Some believe MTW agencies have shown success outside traditional regulations, influencing housing reform discussions. Lessons from the program may inform future federal housing assistance reforms. The MTW demonstration program provides flexibility for PHAs to test new approaches in providing housing assistance to low-income families. Congress authorized this program in 1996 to explore innovative policies outside of traditional HUD programs. Lessons from the program may influence future federal housing assistance reforms. The MTW demonstration program allows PHAs to test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families, aiming to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing options. Up to 30 PHAs can participate in the program through a competitive selection process, with detailed evaluations conducted for up to 15 agencies to identify successful models for replication. The legislative guidelines for the program are broad, allowing flexibility in program design. The MTW demonstration program allows PHAs to develop and test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families. The law grants flexibility for PHAs to combine funding streams, waive statutory requirements, and design rent policies. The law allows PHAs to combine Section 8 voucher funding with public housing funding, creating a single stream for housing assistance. It permits PHAs to design a \"reasonable\" rent policy to promote employment and self-sufficiency. However, there are limits on flexibility for MTW agencies, requiring them to serve a specific number and mix of families, ensure a majority are low-income, and meet HUD housing quality standards. The law imposes limits on the flexibility of MTW agencies, requiring them to serve a specific number and mix of low-income families, meet HUD housing quality standards, and seek public input in developing their policies. PHAs must hold a public hearing on proposed policies before submitting an application to become an MTW agency, taking public comments into account in their application plan approved by HUD. The law requires a PHA to hold a public hearing on its proposed policies before submitting an application to become an MTW agency. The PHA must consider public comments in its MTW application plan, which outlines how it will use flexibilities under the program. HUD must approve the plan for a PHA to participate in the MTW demonstration program, and monitor compliance. MTW agencies must submit annual reports to HUD detailing fund use, activities, and data for program assessment. This statutory authorization allows MTW agencies to implement various policies and activities. Understanding the policy context is essential to grasp the structure of the MTW demonstration program. The MTW demonstration program allows agencies to implement diverse policies and activities, shaped by the policy context of public housing reform in the 1980s and 1990s. Federal policymakers sought strategies to reduce costs and improve management due to concerns about rising costs and decaying housing stock. During the 1980s and 1990s, federal policymakers were interested in reducing costs and improving management of public housing. Policy debates on block granting and devolving assisted housing programs to the local level influenced the development of the MTW demonstration program, which aimed to give local officials more autonomy in designing programs to meet community needs. Some believed federal regulation was necessary for assisted housing programs. The possibility of devolving assisted housing programs to the local level was debated by federal policymakers in the 1990s. Some believed federal regulation was necessary to achieve housing goals, while others focused on increasing family self-sufficiency and reducing costs through market-based approaches. The MTW demonstration program aimed to address these varying policy perspectives. The MTW demonstration program, initiated in December 1996 by HUD, aimed to address varying policy goals in social welfare programs, including housing assistance. 30 PHAs were selected to participate in the program, engaging in a complex negotiation process to set the terms of their agreements. The first agreement was reached in February 1998 after individual approval of statutory or regulatory waivers. In 1998, HUD selected 30 PHAs for the MTW program. The negotiation process for the agreements was complicated and lengthy, with waivers individually approved. By 1999, most agreements were signed. Six MTW agencies chose not to participate due to delays or increased flexibility in housing programs. In 2000, the remaining spots were allocated competitively. Additional PHAs joined the program through Congressional acts. In 2000, HUD competitively allocated open spaces in the MTW program to housing authorities with more than 2,500 units. Additional PHAs have joined the program through Congressional acts, expanding beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs. Congress directed HUD to add specific PHAs to the MTW demonstration through various legislative acts. HUD has competitively selected PHAs to participate in the MTW program through various legislative acts. Currently, 35 PHAs are part of the demonstration program, with additional agencies being selected by HUD. HUD has selected 35 PHAs to participate in the MTW demonstration program, with four more agencies recently chosen. Criticisms of HUD's implementation include poor performance selection, lack of uniform program structure leading to varied policies, and data system limitations hindering evaluation. HUD's data systems limitations hindered the evaluation of MTW policies, leading to difficulties in comparing results. Reports on MTW were criticized for being process-oriented and lacking in comprehensive evaluation of tenant outcomes and program costs. Insufficient monitoring of the demonstration's implementation was highlighted by the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. HUD's evaluation of MTW policies was criticized for being process-oriented and lacking comprehensive assessment of tenant outcomes and program costs. The Inspector General and Government Accountability Office highlighted insufficient monitoring of the demonstration's implementation. In response, HUD implemented a standard MTW agreement in 2008 to improve monitoring and oversight, extending agencies' participation until 2018. The standard MTW agreement introduced in 2008 extended agencies' participation in the demonstration program until 2018, allowing for more systematic evaluation of policies. However, it does not require standardization of performance data, limiting HUD's ability to evaluate specific policies. HUD has also started collecting data on tenant characteristics to evaluate MTW policies in terms of tenant outcomes and housing costs. HUD has increased efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with program requirements. Terms like \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice\" are undefined in the MTW statute, prompting HUD to require agencies to create their own definitions. HUD also plans to provide a template for collecting data on a \"comparable mix of families.\" In 2011, HUD assessed whether MTW agencies met statutory requirements. HUD announced plans to require MTW agencies to establish their own definitions of \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice,\" and to provide a template for collecting data on a \"comparable mix of families.\" In 2011, HUD assessed MTW agencies' compliance with program requirements, finding that 91% served low-income individuals and almost all served a similar number of families. The GAO report noted HUD's efforts to ensure compliance but highlighted the need for continued monitoring. The GAO report found that most MTW agencies served a similar number of families, with HUD's initiatives moving in the right direction for compliance. However, without standard definitions and a systematic process, HUD cannot effectively evaluate agencies' compliance with statutory requirements. The HUD IG report recommended no additional MTW agencies be added until program administration improved. HUD has made efforts to enhance oversight of the MTW program but still struggles to ensure agencies comply with requirements. The IG report suggests no new MTW agencies should be added until program administration improves. MTW agencies have implemented various program activities, from complete transformations to modest policy changes, applying their policies to all or select assisted households. MTW agencies have discretion in three policy areas: merging funding streams, level of assistance, and administrative flexibilities. Policies vary among agencies, and changes over time are noted. This report does not evaluate the effectiveness of MTW policies. MTW agencies have the flexibility to merge funding streams, adjust assistance levels, and implement administrative changes. Policies may vary among agencies, with some opting for a \"block grant\" approach that combines different funding sources. This departure from traditional operations allows for more flexibility in fund usage across programs. MTW agencies have the flexibility to merge funding streams and implement administrative changes, departing from traditional operations. This \"block grant\" approach allows for more flexibility in fund usage across programs, with funding determined through negotiation rather than traditional formulas. Only six MTW agencies initially elected to receive merged assistance funding. MTW agencies have the flexibility to merge funding streams and implement administrative changes, departing from traditional operations. The amount of MTW block grant assistance is determined through negotiation rather than traditional formulas. Initially, only six MTW agencies elected to receive merged assistance funding, but now the majority do. A 2004 report showed that MTW agencies used funding flexibility to address financial shortfalls and for cross-programmatic purposes approved by HUD. MTW agencies utilized funding flexibility to address financial shortfalls and implement cross-programmatic initiatives approved by HUD. This autonomy from regulatory processes encouraged alternative uses of funds, such as developing additional support services for tenants to increase self-sufficiency. Some agencies used the flexibility for development projects that would not have been feasible without merged funding. MTW agencies used funding flexibility for development projects and to leverage financing for low-income housing units. Some agencies, like the Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority, undertook significant redevelopment of their public housing stock. Some MTW agencies, like the Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority, used their flexibility to redevelop public housing stocks and attract private investment for new mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream was crucial in obtaining financing for these transformation plans. The Chicago Housing Authority and other MTW agencies utilized their funding flexibility to redevelop public housing and attract private investment for mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream played a key role in obtaining financing for these transformation plans. Clara and the City of San Jose have utilized funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments, aiming to leverage additional outside financing. Project-basing of vouchers is more common among MTW PHAs than non-MTW PHAs, allowing PHAs to reserve units for low-income tenants by attaching vouchers to them. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program allows PHAs to project-base vouchers, with more flexibility for MTW agencies to convert public housing to project-based vouchers or similar assistance. MTW agencies have the flexibility to convert public housing to project-based vouchers or similar assistance, including project-basing former public housing properties sold to nonprofit organizations. They can also project-base entire buildings to serve special populations and have their own processes for awarding project-based assistance. The majority of MTW agencies either currently have project-based voucher assistance or plan to begin project-basing vouchers. MTW agencies have the flexibility to convert public housing to project-based vouchers or similar assistance. The majority of MTW agencies either currently have project-based voucher assistance or plan to begin project-basing vouchers, which is a much higher rate than non-MTW PHAs. Several MTW activities can affect the level of assistance provided to tenants, including experimenting with alternative income calculations and rent amounts. MTW agencies had full discretion to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures until 2011. HUD issued guidance in 2011 requiring MTW agencies to determine housing assistance eligibility based on statutory income calculations. MTW agencies can still implement alternative rent structures but must comply with new income calculation guidelines. MTW agencies previously had full discretion to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures until 2011. However, new guidance now requires compliance with statutory income calculations for housing assistance eligibility. MTW agencies can still implement alternative rent structures and set additional conditions for tenants. Industry groups argue that current income calculations and rent structures are overly complicated and discourage tenants from increasing their income. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures due to the complexity of current systems, which deter income reporting and discourage tenants from increasing their income. These agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and not including income from assets below a certain threshold. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and not including income from assets below a certain threshold value. Over half of participating agencies in 2011 used modified income or asset disregard, and a quarter used modified deductions. Many agencies have also reduced the frequency of verifying tenants' income, especially for those with fixed incomes like the elderly or disabled. Most MTW agencies have simplified income calculations and reduced the frequency of verifying tenants' income, especially for those with fixed incomes like the elderly or disabled. 88% of MTW agencies are using an alternate schedule for recertifying tenant income, potentially forgoing additional revenue or increasing subsidy costs for administrative savings or changes in tenant circumstances. MTW agencies have simplified income calculations and reduced income verification frequency. 88% of agencies use alternate schedules for recertifying tenant income, potentially affecting revenue and subsidy costs. The cost-effectiveness of this approach is unknown. Assisted tenants pay up to 30% of their income towards rent, with flexibility for minimum rent policies. MTW agencies utilize provided flexibility. MTW agencies have experimented with various rent structures, including minimum and maximum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, and alternative subsidies. Most agencies have their own minimum rent policies, some have tiered rent policies, and others have adopted alternative approaches. MTW agencies have implemented different rent structures like minimum rents, tiered rents, and flat rents. Some agencies have simplified utility calculations for determining subsidies. Officials believe alternative rent structures encourage work and mimic the private market. MTW agencies believe alternative rent structures encourage work by not penalizing tenants for income increases, mimicking the private market. These structures are easier to understand and administer. However, there is a lack of systematic data to evaluate if these rent changes have increased tenant earnings or decreased administrative work and out-of-pocket payments. MTW PHAs have implemented new requirements for tenants, including work requirements and time limit policies, to encourage self-sufficiency and serve more families. Approximately one-third of MTW agencies have work requirements, while half as many have time limit policies. These agencies also provide supportive services to families subject to these requirements. Many MTW agencies have implemented time limit policies to encourage self-sufficiency and serve more families. These policies vary in duration, ranging from three to seven years. In addition to work requirements, supportive services are provided to families subject to these policies. Some policies aim to streamline operations without changing the level or type of assistance families receive. Many MTW agencies have adopted policies to streamline operations without altering assistance levels, such as alternative inspection and reporting schedules. These policies aim to ensure decent housing quality while reducing administrative burdens. Some MTW agencies have implemented alternative inspection schedules to streamline operations and reduce administrative burdens while maintaining housing quality standards. This includes clustering inspections based on location and utilizing risk-based inspection models for landlords with good records. The Oakland Housing Authority and other MTW agencies have implemented risk-based inspection models for landlords with good records, allowing for less frequent inspections and self-certification of units. HUD's 2010 Report to Congress suggests that these alternative HQS inspection procedures have maintained housing quality standards in a less burdensome way. The alternative HQS inspection procedures adopted by MTW agencies have maintained housing quality standards in a less burdensome way. However, a full evaluation is needed to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional inspection procedures with alternative ones. MTW agencies differ in how they report program information to HUD due to the different accountability structure of the MTW demonstration program. MTW agencies have different reporting requirements compared to non-MTW agencies, with MTW plans focusing on creativity and strategic planning. Reporting encourages program innovation and some activities could have been done outside of the MTW program. MTW agencies must now include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval, shifting from previous flexibility in implementation. Reporting requirements under MTW are seen as encouraging program creativity and strategic planning, with some activities deemed only possible within the MTW framework. Since 2008, MTW agencies must include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval, increasing oversight. However, GAO has raised concerns about self-reporting without verification, and some agencies struggle with new reporting requirements. HUD's reporting systems also lack capacity for data input. HUD has reported that some MTW agencies have struggled with new reporting requirements after not reporting on activities for up to 11 years. There has been no systematic evaluation of the outcomes of the policies adopted by MTW agencies in achieving program goals. Despite the lack of verified evidence, a more systematic evaluation may be possible in the future as HUD standardizes the program and increases data collection. Despite the lack of verified evidence, observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD have informed policy debates about the impact of the MTW demonstration program on tenants and PHAs' operations. Concerns have been raised by low-income housing advocates about the potential negative effects on assisted housing tenants due to policies adopted by MTW agencies. Since the start of the MTW demonstration program, concerns have been raised by low-income housing advocates about the impact on assisted housing tenants. HUD suggests that MTW has allowed PHAs to offer more housing units, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. However, the overall effect on tenants remains unclear. The MTW program has allowed participating PHAs to offer more housing units, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. However, the impact on current recipients is uncertain, as some agencies may be reducing assistance to current tenants to assist more families. Some PHAs have implemented policies that reduce rental assistance for tenants, potentially impacting low-income individuals. MTW agencies' self-sufficiency programs could benefit families in the long term, but time limits and work requirements may lead to needy families losing assistance. Reports suggest MTW agencies have limited tenants' access to portability, affecting housing choices. Further research is needed to determine the overall impact of MTW discretion on low-income individuals. The MTW demonstration program has allowed for the demolition of public housing in some communities, impacting tenants' lives. MTW agencies have more flexibility in demolishing and replacing public housing stock, like Atlanta and Chicago PHAs replacing lost stock with vouchers and mixed-income developments. Further research is needed to understand the overall impact of MTW discretion on low-income individuals. The flexibility of being an MTW agency allows for the demolition and disposition of public housing stock, as seen in Atlanta and Chicago PHAs. Replacement housing is argued to be of better quality, but tenant advocates raise concerns about large-scale displacement destroying communities and making social services less accessible. Research has focused on the effects of programs like HOPE VI on tenants. Research on the effects of HOPE VI program shows positive outcomes for tenants who were displaced from severely distressed public housing, now living in lower-poverty neighborhoods with improved health outcomes. However, some vulnerable tenants, such as large families or those with disabilities, have not seen the same benefits. Critics argue that large-scale displacement destroys communities and makes social services less accessible. Some vulnerable tenants, like large families or those with disabilities, have not benefited as much from public housing revitalization. Supporters of the program believe it has been successful in improving health outcomes for displaced tenants. The Moving to Work (MTW) program is believed to be successful in improving cost-effectiveness and efficiency in the administration of assisted housing programs, as supported by PHA industry groups, some Members of Congress, and HUD officials. However, not all agree with this belief, as some low-income housing advocates argue that MTW agencies may actually administer assisted housing at a higher cost than non-MTW agencies. Some low-income housing advocates argue that MTW agencies may administer assisted housing at a higher cost than non-MTW agencies, impacting funding levels and administrative burdens. MTW agencies have increased discretion and decreased administrative burdens compared to non-MTW agencies. They define their own outcome goals instead of following traditional regulatory oversight. MTW agencies have autonomy in setting their own outcome goals and self-reporting their effectiveness to HUD, allowing for innovative strategies and focus on program outcomes. Supporters argue for deregulation and a shift away from traditional regulatory oversight, but the monitoring of program funds and outcomes remains unclear. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Supporters propose expanding MTW to a permanent program, while others suggest limited expansion with changes to address concerns and improve evaluation. HUD will decide whether to renew agreements, but the direction of the program remains unclear. The future of the MTW demonstration program remains uncertain. Supporters propose expanding it to a permanent program, while critics call for phasing it out. The debate centers on whether MTW should be a testing ground for reforming rental assistance programs or if some version of the program is the future of assisted housing. Policymakers must decide on the program's direction. The debate surrounding the MTW demonstration program questions whether it should be a testing ground for rental assistance program reform or if it represents the future of assisted housing. Policymakers must decide whether to change MTW to be more effective, make it a permanent program, or maintain the status quo. The program's purpose is to design and test various approaches for providing housing assistance that align with its goals of reducing costs, promoting work and self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. The MTW demonstration program aims to design and test various approaches for providing housing assistance that align with goals of reducing costs, promoting work and self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. However, the program's effectiveness as a true demonstration has been limited due to the lack of full assessment of the models used by PHAs. Some have called for changes to the program to address these limitations. The MTW program aims to test different housing assistance approaches but lacks full assessment of effectiveness. Calls for changes include targeted, temporary demonstrations for specific policy testing. HUD proposes expanding the program to 60 agencies for systematic evaluation. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for a more targeted selection and evaluation of specific policies. The goal is to assess policies for potential national adoption, aligning with legislative proposals for housing reform. The MTW demonstration program was created as a compromise between policymakers to transform rental assistance programs into a flexible block grant program. It has expanded over time, with many PHAs wanting MTW status, leading to calls for its expansion and permanency. The MTW compromise created a new housing program for some PHAs while maintaining existing programs for others. There is a growing interest in expanding MTW and making it a permanent program, with proposals to increase the number of eligible PHAs and deregulate federal housing assistance. Some have proposed block granting and deregulating federal housing assistance for all PHAs, similar to the MTW program. Concerns have been raised about potential funding reductions and loss of tenant protections under this model. Tenant advocates are concerned that deregulation of grant programs could lead to loss of protection against rent increases and unreasonable conditions. HUD is worried about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW program, recommending selection based on evaluation capacity and past performance. HUD recommends selecting high-performing PHAs for the MTW program based on evaluation capacity and past performance. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program would be suitable for small PHAs. Existing MTW agencies have agreements through 2018, with the option for extensions. Congress may choose to maintain the program as is. The MTW demonstration program may continue as is, with existing agencies having agreements through 2018. Congress could consider adding a small number of additional agencies. HUD has taken steps to address concerns, such as increasing reporting requirements and standardizing agreements. Participating PHAs will continue to experiment with new policies that could impact assisted housing programs. The MTW demonstration program may continue with existing agencies having agreements through 2018. HUD has taken steps to address concerns by increasing reporting requirements and standardizing agreements. Participating PHAs will experiment with new policies that could influence assisted housing programs. HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating reforms adopted by MTW agencies into mainstream programs. Obama Administration and Members of Congress have proposed changes to rental assistance programs, including inspection and income calculation rules. Some proposed changes to HUD rental assistance programs include allowing PHAs to adopt policies experimented with by MTW PHAs, such as biennial inspections, alternate income documentation, streamlined rent calculation, higher minimum rents, expanded authority to \"voucher-out\" public housing, and blending operating and capital funding. Bipartisan consensus is forming on some reforms, but controversial policies remain, such as changing assistance amounts and imposing conditions like time limits and work requirements. Some reforms based on the MTW demonstration are gaining bipartisan support, including blending public housing funding and allowing PHAs to adopt certain policies. However, controversial issues persist, such as changing assistance amounts and imposing conditions like time limits and work requirements on residents. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about the impact of these policies on tenant outcomes and the overall goals of the demonstration."
