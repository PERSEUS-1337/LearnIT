    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from disruptions to CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, focusing on national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, framing the issue in terms of national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. It defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, setting ambitious goals for eliminating vulnerability to cyber or physical attacks. However, establishing consistent criteria for this has proven extremely difficult. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, aiming to eliminate vulnerability to cyber or physical attacks. However, assessing the criticality of specific assets has proven challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of infrastructure systems. For example, the U.S. electricity sub-sector alone has nearly 7,000 operational power plants, highlighting the difficulty in identifying and inventorying critical assets and systems. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets that, if incapacitated or destroyed, would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, and public health. The U.S. and global economies' scale and complexity make it challenging to identify and inventory critical assets, such as the nearly 7,000 operational power plants in the electricity sub-sector. The USA PATRIOT Act defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets crucial to national security, economic security, and public health. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include essential services and conveniences to the public, with a focus on asymmetric threats posed by state and non-state adversaries. The USA PATRIOT Act defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets crucial to national security, economic security, and public health. The focus is on asymmetric threats posed by state and non-state adversaries, including physical or cyber attacks that could disrupt domestic CI systems and assets. Natural disasters and other causes of damage have also become important in critical infrastructure policy since 9/11. Since 9/11, critical infrastructure policy has expanded to include natural disasters and other disruptive events not directly related to terrorism. The definition of critical infrastructure has been broadened to encompass events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government. Emphasis is now placed on infrastructure as a facilitator of prosperity, public safety, and civic life, as outlined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) published by DHS in 2013. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), published by DHS in 2013, defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that underpin American society. This reflects a shift towards society-centric resilience at the system level over security-oriented protection of specific assets. Since 1998, CI policy has expanded to focus on societal resilience at the system level rather than specific asset protection. In 2017, DHS designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. The DHS describes the components of election systems as physical locations and technology infrastructure, which are critical for supporting the nation's civic life. There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors outlined in PPD-21, used as an organizing framework for public-private partnerships with CI owner-operators. DHS is responsible for coordinating partnership programs, which are non-regulatory in nature. The federal government uses critical infrastructure sectors as an organizing framework for public-private partnerships with self-identified CI owner-operators. DHS coordinates partnership programs, with other federal agencies serving as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure sectors have policy implications for Congress. Each sector has formal coordination bodies with private sector stakeholders, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments involved. New public and private sector communities of interest emerge within the critical infrastructure enterprise, each with its unique perspective on criticality. As critical infrastructure sectors mature, new public and private sector communities of interest emerge with unique perspectives on criticality. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure, reflecting diverse interests and evolving perspectives. The multiplicity of official definitions reflects efforts to negotiate congressional responsibility boundaries. Critical infrastructure policy has two distinct orientations: Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and protecting infrastructure assets based on the consequences of asset loss or disruption. Definitions of critical infrastructure reflect diverse interests and constituencies negotiating boundaries of responsibility and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) prioritizes and safeguards infrastructure assets based on the consequences of loss or disruption. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) focuses on investments in hazard mitigation, preparedness, and adaptation to ensure availability of essential services during emergencies. Major legislation for CI policy was enacted post-9/11 attacks, emphasizing physical protection of critical infrastructure. The foundation of critical infrastructure policy was established post-9/11 attacks, emphasizing physical protection of assets. However, policy practice now leans towards system resilience over asset protection, creating a hybrid approach that can complicate defining criticality. This report uses the term \"critical infrastructure security\" to discuss CI policy without favoring CIP or CIR. The national CI policy reflects a hybrid approach combining elements of CIP and CIR, leading to complexities in defining criticality and identifying critical infrastructure. Legislation and government directives post-2001 focus on creating asset lists to identify systems requiring higher levels of protection. However, the practical application of this logic introduces complexities in asset identification and prioritization. The logic behind identifying critical infrastructure assets and the need for protection introduces complexities in practice. Inventory requirements are the first step in risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. Defining criticality criteria remains a debated topic, but list/no-list decisions help determine which assets are considered critical in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a methodology for identifying critical facilities. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which focused on Critical Infrastructure Identification. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets in February 2003 led to the development of a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities by DHS. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which focused on Critical Infrastructure Identification and served as the basis for CI policy development until 2013. The 2006 National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) aimed to protect critical infrastructure and key resources. However, a 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the national database of CI assets, which included a wide range of assets from nuclear power plants to petting zoos and water parks. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report identified methodological shortcomings in the Department's National Asset Database, which had expanded significantly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006. The report highlighted entries of \"unusual\" assets without clear criticality and inconsistencies in data collection procedures. This led to Congress including provisions for the National Asset Database in the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 included provisions for the National Asset Database, requiring compilation of vital systems or assets and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The Secretary determines assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed. Other provisions include definitions of infrastructure-related terms and quality control procedures for asset nominations. The Secretary determines critical assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed. Quality control procedures are implemented to ensure asset nominations meet the threshold of criticality. A 2013 GAO report highlighted concerns about reporting criteria and methodology in the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program. The report highlighted changes in nomination and adjudication criteria of the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) post-2009. NCIPP assessed criticality based on potential adverse consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique critical infrastructure characteristics, such as the impact of the collapse of the U.S. financial system on national security and public health. Election infrastructure for federal elections was added as a CI sub-sector in 2017. The report recommended an independent peer review for asset nomination vetting methods in the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) to ensure the identification of the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Being listed as a prioritized asset in the NCIPP elevates its national significance, impacting government prioritization, regulatory regimes, criminal prosecutions, and emergency preparedness. The National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) prioritizes assets of national significance, impacting government activities such as risk assessments, regulatory regimes, and emergency preparedness. Despite the significant ramifications of the NCIPP list, some states opt out due to compliance burdens and technical limitations. The exact number of nominated assets is classified but numbers in the thousands. The 2013 GAO report found that some states were not participating in DHS data calls for the NCIPP list due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States lacked expertise to develop scenarios and model complex infrastructure systems accurately. DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements, indicating persistent difficulties in ensuring completeness and quality of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The complexities of CI inventory and categorization suggest persistent difficulties in ensuring completeness, quality, and currency of centralized inventories of CI assets requiring protected status. CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on critical infrastructure systems, expanding data collection to include all assets within a CI sector useful in emergency planning or contingency situations. This data can be used to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services if usual systems are compromised. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database compiles data from various agencies to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services in emergency situations. HIFLD contains hundreds of data layers encompassing various asset categories relevant to homeland security functions. HIFLD compiles data from public and private sector partners to provide critical asset information to law enforcement and emergency management agencies. The database includes essential assets for supporting lifeline critical infrastructure functions, as well as non-critical assets that may become important in specific emergencies or policy decisions. HIFLD compiles critical asset information for law enforcement and emergency management agencies, including non-critical assets that may become important in specific emergencies or policy decisions. For example, during the 2017 hurricane season, the Department of Health and Human Services used HIFLD to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which were essential for providing critical public health services. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for government agencies and private sector entities to address real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities. Unlike the NCIPP list, it does not elevate specific systems and assets to support federal oversight, regulation, and administration. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for government agencies and private sector entities to address real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities. It contrasts with the declining state participation in NCIPP, but CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant. For example, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act required DHS to determine critical utilities and national security assets at risk. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act required DHS to identify critical utilities and national security assets at risk, including specific chemical manufacturing facilities subject to inspection under CFATS. Policy shifts towards system-level resilience may impact legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list and asset-protection approaches to CI risk management. Congress may need to consider the implications of policy shifts towards system-level resilience for legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list and asset-protection approaches to critical infrastructure risk management. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional appropriations for data gathering and analysis. Updates to the National Asset Database requirements in the 9/11 Commission Act should be considered to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets are part of a national initiative to understand and assess homeland security risks. Congress may need to update National Asset Database requirements to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities, ensuring relevance and alignment with other authorized programs. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures for critical infrastructure. DHS is responsible for coordinating and overseeing national infrastructure. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures for critical infrastructure. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. Threat assessments cover human adversaries and natural hazards. DHS considers threat, vulnerability, and consequence as components of risk. Threat is defined as potential harm from natural or man-made occurrences, while vulnerability is the physical feature or operational attribute that makes an entity susceptible to harm. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard. Recommendations for resilience measures to mitigate vulnerabilities are included in assessments. Consequence is defined as the effect of an event, incident, or occurrence. DHS defines consequence as the \"effect of an event, incident, or occurrence.\" Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt infrastructure systems and assets, using various technical and non-technical methods. Different modeling methodologies are developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups to inform security investments. Non-technical assessments are also made by subject-matter experts and officials based on knowledge and experience. Different modeling methodologies are developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups to inform infrastructure security investments. Consequence-based criticality assessments can be used in risk assessments when combined with threat and vulnerability assessments. DHS has applied risk elements to its planning, programs, and budget activities since 2007, using the formula R=f(TVC). Critics challenge the formula's accuracy in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks. Critics challenge the formula R=f(TVC) used by DHS for risk assessment, citing difficulties in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and the interdependence of threat, vulnerability, and consequences. DHS recognized the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure in 2018. The DHS recognized the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure in 2018, leading to the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to address CI risk management. The creation of CISA as a dedicated agency for infrastructure security elevates CI risk management as a policy focus. CISA has established the NRMC as a center for planning, analysis, and collaboration to manage national CI risk with an evolved approach emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches. Congress may request information from CISA on efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods and ensure validation by qualified external reviewers. The National Laboratories, university-based DHS Centers of Excellence, and other research centers provide expertise in infrastructure risk assessment methodology. Congress can establish funding priorities and program guidance to support national CI security goals. Federal organization for CI issues has evolved in response to changing threats. Federal organization for critical infrastructure (CI) security has evolved in response to changing threats. Three distinct periods of development are covered: the late 1990s policy initiatives, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the ongoing transition to an all-hazards resilience framework. Attention to CI policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about potential malicious exploitation of technology and infrastructure interface. The federal government reorganized to counter terrorist threats to infrastructure and transitioned to an all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure security in response to increasing concerns about cyber threats in the late 1990s. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996, leading to the issuance of PDD-63 two years later, which focused on eliminating vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures to non-traditional cyber or physical attacks within five years. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996, leading to the issuance of PDD-63 two years later, focusing on eliminating vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures to non-traditional cyber or physical attacks within five years. The organizational directives in PDD-63 aimed to increase interagency coordination by leveraging existing federal entities, with the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism playing a key role. Congress later chartered the Gilmore Commission in 1999 to assess terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, assessed terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. The report found that PDD-63 implementation was incomplete, with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers still in early stages. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism had broad authorities. The Gilmore Commission report assessed the incomplete implementation of PDD-63, highlighting the early stages of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism had broad authorities but lacked program and budget authority. The National Infrastructure Protection Center had not fully established its functions under FBI auspices. The 9/11 attacks had a significant impact on homeland security and critical infrastructure protection policy. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national action on homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection. Two legislative tracks emerged, with one proposing to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security under FBI auspices, similar to the National Office of Drug Control Policy. This option aimed to improve coordination and oversight while maintaining much of the existing federal government structure. The second legislative track proposed consolidating government counterterrorism functions under a new federal agency named the National Homeland Security Agency, following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission. Key supporters in Congress believed this consolidation would enhance protection against major terrorist attacks by improving interagency coordination. The National Homeland Security Agency was proposed to consolidate security functions across federal departments following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected this approach, transferring infrastructure security functions to DHS for better coordination and executive authority. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS, incorporating nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. The creation of DHS was designated as high risk in 2003 due to the management challenges presented by the large number of agencies being transferred. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS, incorporating nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. The new department prioritized homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism, representing a change from previous infrastructure policy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recognized CIP as a separate but related mission in a report to Congress on federal counterterrorism programs. The White House previously viewed infrastructure policy as tangentially related to counterterrorism before 9/11. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) distinguished CIP as a separate but related mission in a report to Congress on federal counterterrorism programs in August 2001. They justified this distinction due to diverse infrastructure risks beyond terrorism, including equipment failure, human error, weather, natural disasters, and criminal activity. CIP funding that overlapped with counterterrorism was minimal, amounting to less than half of one percent of the total $2.6 billion requested by the White House. The 2003 OMB report to Congress highlighted infrastructure programs' relation to counterterrorism efforts post-9/11. The White House requested a significant budget increase for FY2004, reflecting the newfound importance of counterterrorism priorities. The budget request for FY2004 was $12.1 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. The 2003 OMB report emphasized the connection between infrastructure programs and counterterrorism efforts post-9/11. The White House requested a substantial budget increase for FY2004, totaling $12.1 billion, reflecting the heightened importance of counterterrorism priorities. The budget increase represented a significant shift in federal departments and agencies towards prioritizing counterterrorism efforts. The creation of a new purpose-built department, DHS, aimed to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions under unified leadership. More than half of pre-9/11 homeland security funding was transferred to DHS, but independent agencies within DHS and other departments retained significant independence in operational and infrastructure security functions. CIP remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Despite significant changes, critical infrastructure protection (CIP) remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Counterterrorism remained a focal point for CIP policy, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened considerably by 2005. In 2005, public perception of the terrorist threat had significantly softened, with only 6%-8% of Americans considering it a major concern. Terrorism was no longer listed as a category of public concern in early 2019 Gallup surveys. The failure of the levy system during Hurricane Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to various hazards beyond terrorism. After Hurricane Katrina, the failure of the levy system in New Orleans emphasized the vulnerability of critical systems to diverse hazards. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued in 2006 that government policies focused too much on protecting assets from terrorism and not enough on improving resilience against various threats. Defensive strategies were deemed \"brittle\" as not all targets could be protected, leaving the nation exposed. The government's critical infrastructure policies were criticized for focusing too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks and not enough on improving resilience against various threats. The Task Force deemed this defensive posture as \"brittle,\" as not all targets could be protected, leaving the nation vulnerable. In 2008, the House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings addressing resilience, where DHS officials argued that government policies did encourage resilience. Subsequent policy documents placed greater emphasis on resilience, as seen in the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the diversity of missions and stakeholders in the expansive enterprise of homeland security. It noted the importance of preventing terrorist attacks while also addressing threats like natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. The review emphasized DHS's leadership role in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review identified various challenges, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. It emphasized DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. The report highlighted the decentralized nature of homeland security, involving diverse stakeholders in the public and private sectors. In 2013, PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7, guiding federal infrastructure protection and informing the 2013 NIPP. In 2013, PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 as the authoritative policy guidance for federal infrastructure protection. It emphasized all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience and integration with the national preparedness system. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect, going beyond terrorism-related threats. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving no current departmental-level statement on strategic direction for infrastructure security. Boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security are still being negotiated. The Homeland Security Act does not currently have a departmental-level statement specifying DHS strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security are still being negotiated among various stakeholders. Congress directed the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS in 2002, but in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of its functions back to USDA. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center was transferred to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns of terrorist threats to the food and agriculture sector. However, in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of the facility back to USDA. Critical infrastructure security in the federal government has evolved into a distributed enterprise with an emphasis on an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine which aspects of critical infrastructure security belong within the homeland security enterprise. The federal government's critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise with an emphasis on an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to consider the boundaries between homeland security and other infrastructure policy dimensions. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since the 2014 QHSR, raising concerns about the lack of a current strategy. The evolving definition of homeland security and the need for a current top-level strategy from DHS have raised concerns. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy is evident in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives unanimously and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The proposed act would require DHS to consult with advisory committees when developing its strategy and link it more directly with budgeting and program management. Congress has periodically acted to define organizational relationships within DHS. The Department of Homeland Security has undergone organizational changes, moving from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may consider the level of centralization or federation that best supports the critical infrastructure security mission. The National Protection and Programs Directorate, now an agency within DHS, administers infrastructure partnership programs. Congress may consider the level of centralization or federation that best supports critical infrastructure security. The federated partnership model, relying on voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors, guides investment in critical infrastructure security. Owners of critical infrastructure have ultimate responsibility for managing risks in a complex ownership and regulatory environment. Legislators and policymakers support the federated partnership model for critical infrastructure security, emphasizing voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors. CI owner-operators are responsible for risk assessment and mitigation at the enterprise level, while Congress directs national-level risk management. This collaborative approach relies on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary security investments. Private sector investments in critical infrastructure security are primarily handled by individuals or entities, with public and larger risks shared collectively. The partnership model for critical infrastructure security involves collaboration between public and private sectors, with a focus on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. Responsibility for managing CI risk at the societal level is determined collaboratively by government and private-sector representatives. The challenge lies in determining who should bear the upfront costs of investment and what regulatory measures should be in place. At the societal level, managing critical infrastructure (CI) risk involves determining responsibility for upfront investment costs and necessary regulatory measures. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop CI risk management strategies voluntarily. Government efforts to encourage infrastructure resilience investments through public-private partnerships have varied in effectiveness. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes government-industry partnership for national resilience goals. Government encourages voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships, but effectiveness varies, especially for low-probability/high-consequence events. Industry participation incentives include access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence CI policy. Congress has acted to improve information sharing between the public and private sectors. The benefits of industry participation in national resilience goals include improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. Legislation such as the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 and public-private coordination councils facilitate information sharing and collaboration between the public and private sectors. The Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) program and public-private coordination councils facilitate policy discussions and information sharing. A 2019 OECD report highlighted the need for regulatory mandates in addition to voluntary partnerships to ensure investments in resilience, especially in sectors with potentially catastrophic impacts like nuclear meltdowns or terrorist attacks. Countries use regulatory mandates to drive investments in resilience in critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic impacts. Collaborative approaches are favored as risks become more privatized, but policymakers aim to limit government regulation in the CI security enterprise. For example, PDD-63 emphasizes avoiding increased government regulation or unfunded mandates to the private sector. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in critical infrastructure security. Various organizations, such as DHS, TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA, have specific regulatory mandates within their respective areas to prevent terrorist exploitation. The Coast Guard, CISA, and other agencies have regulatory mandates in critical infrastructure security to prevent terrorist exploitation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also regulates civilian nuclear facilities for safety and reporting requirements. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates civilian nuclear facilities for safety and reporting requirements, stemming from the partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979. Infrastructure security relevant to homeland security, such as protection against deliberate attacks, is overseen by the NRC, not DHS. Agencies typically separate regulation and partnership roles to enhance collaboration with infrastructure security partners. The DHS had difficulty engaging private sector entities in its early stages due to its unclear separation from FBI law-enforcement functions. Current infrastructure security programs focus on voluntary collaboration through information sharing, training, and coordination. CI partnership structures operate under PPD-21, with sector and cross-sector partnerships outlined in the 2013 NIPP emphasizing distributed responsibility among stakeholders. The 2013 NIPP outlines infrastructure protection efforts through sector and cross-sector partnerships, emphasizing distributed responsibility among stakeholders. NIPP partnerships are administered by CISA in collaboration with other federal agencies, with each CI sector having its own Government Coordinating Council and Sector Coordinating Council for coordination on infrastructure issues. The NIPP framework includes Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Councils (SCC) for interagency coordination on infrastructure issues. Each GCC is led by a Sector-Specific Agency (SSA), with DHS leading or co-leading 10 of the 16 GCCs. Other SSAs include EPA, GSA, and various departments like Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health, Transportation, and Treasury. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are comprised of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) as representative of their sector. They work with Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) to develop infrastructure protection plans tailored to sector risks and interdependencies. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are formed by private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) as sector representatives. They advise the federal government, facilitate coordination between government and private stakeholders, and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for information sharing. The National Council of ISACs has 24 member organizations, which maintain operations centers and collaborate with cybersecurity and infrastructure centers. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations that maintain operations centers and collaborate with cybersecurity and infrastructure centers. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across CI sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council enhances infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions. Four cross-sector councils, including the State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC), the Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, the Regional Consortium Coordinating Council, and the Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC), represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests in infrastructure resilience and governance. The FSLC, chaired by the CISA Director, oversees the other councils. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) leads cross-sector councils in forging policy consensus on CI risk management strategies, coordinating issue resolution, and collaborating with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) may host certain discussions for NIPP partnership councils. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions between CI stakeholders on sensitive topics related to infrastructure security. It provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations to promote collaboration and consensus policy advice for DHS and other relevant agencies. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions between stakeholders on infrastructure security topics. CIPAC engages government and private-sector stakeholders through the NIPP partnership structure to develop policy advice for DHS. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides advice to the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on CI policy. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, comprised of senior industry leaders, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. It serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. Established in 2001, its role includes monitoring critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and promoting improved risk management practices in the private industry. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, established in 2001, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. It facilitates consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government, monitoring coordinating councils and promoting risk management practices in private industry. The partnership structure is flat and includes various activities like symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. Participation involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders across different sectors. The partnership structure for critical infrastructure involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders across different sectors. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) within DHS collects, analyzes, and shares real-time threat information and provides decision support to private sector partners. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) under CISA collect, analyze, and share threat information in real-time to support private sector partners. The partnership system aims to increase trust and information sharing between the public and private sectors. The Center for Incidents Affecting Cybersecurity and Communications Networks, administered by CISA, focuses on enhancing collaboration and information-sharing between the public and private sectors to improve system-level resilience. Key questions include the level of private sector engagement in federal initiatives, the effectiveness of private-sector participation in incentivizing risk reduction investments, and the need for legislative remedies to support broader risk reduction efforts. The diversity and breadth of critical infrastructure enterprise as currently defined lead to varying answers regarding private-sector participation in federal initiatives. Empirical analyses on collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited, with only half of CI sectors showing strong engagement in CIP issues through NIPP partnership structures. Strong communities of interest are found in sectors with specific threats and unified trade or professional associations. Limited studies on the effectiveness of collaboration within the voluntary framework for critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. A 2013 study revealed that less than half of the 16 CI sectors had strong \"communities of interest\" engaged in CIP issues through NIPP partnership structures. Strongest communities were in sectors with specific threats and unified trade associations. Private-sector risk mitigation investment driven by cost-benefit analysis. Many CI owner-operators expect government to cover social costs from terrorist attacks. GAO testimony to Congress in 2014 highlighted challenges in DHS partnership efforts and identified key factors affecting partnership effectiveness. Owner-operators expect government to cover social costs from terrorist attacks. GAO testimony to Congress in 2014 highlighted challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to sharing information, sharing assessment results, and evaluating program effectiveness. DHS did not systematically collect data on industry participation in security surveys or measure security improvements. GAO emphasized the need for these measures to evaluate program effectiveness. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted challenges in DHS partnership efforts, emphasizing the lack of data on industry participation in security surveys and security improvements. DHS agreed to corrective measures but progress verification was lacking. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of partnership systems in incentivizing industry information sharing and risk reduction investments. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of partnership systems in incentivizing industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction. Availability of data and rigorous analyses could help determine the effectiveness of these programs. Enhancing reporting requirements and improving data gathering initiatives may address gaps in assessing the reach and impact of public-private partnership programs. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of partnership systems in incentivizing industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction. Enhancing reporting requirements and improving data gathering initiatives may address gaps in assessing the reach and impact of public-private partnership programs, including efficient private investments in national level resilience. Congress may also consider enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may need to assess and potentially adjust sector-specific public-private partnership structures to align with the federal risk management approach emphasizing resilience. Congress may need to consider adjusting or replacing sector-specific public-private partnership structures to better align with the emerging federal risk management approach, which focuses on inter-sectoral analysis and resilience. This includes streamlining partnership efforts to match the new approach."
