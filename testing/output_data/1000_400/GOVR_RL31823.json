In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% pay adjustment under H.R. 2673, signed into law by President George Bush. Additionally, President Bush signed H.R. 2673 into law on January 23, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated the additional pay adjustment as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality increase. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments and net annual and locality pay increases for federal white-collar employees. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on its website on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments, authorized locality payments, and net annual and locality pay increases for federal white-collar employees under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. The annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payment are effective in January of each year, but are not based on measures of the cost of living. The implementation of FEPCA has varied over the years, with reduced amounts of the annual adjustment provided in certain years. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) annual pay adjustment and locality payments are not based on cost-of-living measures. Implementation of FEPCA has varied, with reduced adjustments in some years. In 2003 and 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. If ECI and locality-based comparability payments had been granted as specified by FEPCA, the net pay increase would have been higher. In 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. The nationwide average net pay increase in January 2004 would have been 15.15% if ECI and locality-based comparability payments had been granted as specified by FEPCA. This report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. Federal employees under different schedules receive annual pay adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI determines the increase in private sector wages and salaries, with basic pay rates adjusted accordingly. The ECI indicated a 2.7% across-the-board pay adjustment in January 2004. Basic pay rates are increased by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI for the previous year. The ECI showed a 2.7% pay adjustment in January 2004. FEPCA allows the President to issue an alternative plan in case of national emergency or economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, which may also extend to employees in various positions. These employees will receive a locality pay adjustment in 2004 as determined by the Pay Agent. GS employees, along with certain non-General Schedule employees, receive locality-based comparability payments in 2004. The Pay Agent extends these payments to employees in specific positions, and OPM published regulations in December 2001 to clarify limitations. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System have a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay increase of white-collar employees, but in 2004, their pay adjustment will not be less than that of GS employees in the same location. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay increase of white-collar employees. In 2004, their pay adjustment will not be less than that of GS employees in the same location. Special rate employees receive the higher of the special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) establishes locality-based comparability payments to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality. This adjustment aims to equalize pay rates between GS employees and non-federal workers in the same locality. FEPCA grants the President authority to set alternative comparability payments in times of national emergency or economic hardship. FEPCA allows the President to adjust locality-based comparability payments in times of national emergency or economic hardship. President Bush issued a plan for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide, transitioning from the Occupational Compensation Survey Program to the National Compensation Survey program for locality payments starting in January 2004. The Occupational Compensation Survey Program (OCSP) was replaced by the National Compensation Survey (NCS) for locality payments starting in January 2004. Survey results are submitted to OPM to compare federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area, aiming to reduce the pay gap to 5%. The pay gap between federal and non-federal salaries is compared by grade in each pay area. The target gap is set at 5% by OPM, with FEPCA mandating a yearly closure of a certain percentage of the gap. Starting in 1994, 20% of the gap was closed annually, increasing to 90% by 2001. The pay gap between federal and non-federal salaries is compared by grade in each pay area. Starting in 1994, 20% of the gap was closed annually, increasing to 90% by 2001 as mandated by FEPCA. However, the actual closure percentages were lower each year, with the gap slowly reducing. By January 2002, FEPCA specified that amounts payable could not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The pay gap between federal and non-federal salaries has been slowly decreasing since 1994, with 20% of the gap closed annually. By January 2002, FEPCA mandated that amounts payable could not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent to the President are based on pay gaps that are 22 months old by the effective date of the adjustment. The March 2002 gaps were determined using OCSP and NCS survey data ranging from December 2000 to October 2001 for each pay area. Some pay area data was at least seven years old due to the discontinuation of the OCSP program in October 1996. The data for the largest pay areas, including New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles, ranged from July 1995 to November 1995. Other pay areas varied from January 1996 to November 1996. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps were determined by aging BLS survey data to a common reference date in March 2002 before comparing it to GS pay data. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises to reduce the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. The recommended raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The new locality rate replaces the existing rate. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in 2004 to close the pay gap, with recommended raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% if required payments were granted. Areas with pay gaps below the Rest of the United States (RUS) received the same adjustment as RUS. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in 2004 to close the pay gap, with recommended raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS were recommended to be included with RUS in 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended including areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS in 2004. The council recommended not dropping certain pay areas and considering reallocating resources for new surveys. The basic criteria for determining pay areas remain unchanged since 1993. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay area criteria established in 1993, with exceptions for specific cases like Barnstable County, MA. The council also suggested considering reallocating resources for new surveys based on commuting patterns and population data. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay area criteria from the 2000 census and new metropolitan area definitions. An exception was suggested for Barnstable County, MA, which does not have 2,000 GS employees but meets other criteria to be included in the Boston pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA, in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 despite not meeting the criteria of having 2,000 GS employees. St. Mary's County, MD, and Santa Barbara County, CA, were also recommended to be included in their respective pay areas for 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended including St. Mary's County, MD, in the Washington, DC-Baltimore pay area for 2004, despite dissent from the Vice Chair. New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA, were also recommended to continue being included in their respective pay areas for 2004, even though employment in these areas fell below the required threshold. The Federal Salary Council recommended including St. Mary's County, MD, in the Washington, DC-Baltimore pay area for 2004. New London and Santa Barbara were also recommended to continue in their respective pay areas for 2004, despite falling employment levels. Monterey County, CA, met criteria to be included in the San Francisco pay area in 2001. The council plans to review the locality pay program in 2003 and include Monterey County, CA in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Rhode Island was designated as part of the Boston pay area in 2001 but due to its small size, it will be treated as a single county under the \"Full State\" criteria. Rhode Island is recommended for continued inclusion with the Boston pay area in 2004 under the \"Full State\" criteria. The state is considered as a single county due to its small size and meets the criteria for an installation with at least 1,000 GS employees. The Edwards Air Force Base has been included in the Los Angeles pay area since 1994, even though it no longer meets the employment criteria. The council recommended its continued inclusion in 2004, similar to New London and Santa Barbara, due to employees commuting from the pay area. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program in their report to the Pay Agent on the 2001 locality payments. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program in their report to the Pay Agent on the 2001 locality payments. These improvements include using a three-factor system to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs and developing a model to estimate missing data. BLS has already implemented some of these changes successfully. OPM and BLS have developed a new evaluation system for surveys and will begin phasing it in by December 2003. BLS has also created an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in the surveys. OPM formed a working group to match federal job classifications with the new Standard Occupational Classification System. Additional improvements are expected in the crosswalk between federal and non-federal survey jobs. OPM formed an interagency working group to develop a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS used this crosswalk and March 2001 GS employment weights for data delivery. Additional improvements are anticipated in the crosswalk, with updated GS employment information provided to BLS annually. For supervisory occupations, the highest level of work supervised is graded, adjusting the grade level based on the level of supervision. BLS and Pay Agent staffs have designed a new approach for grading based on the level of supervision. Final tests of this approach are scheduled for the fall, with implementation in surveys by December 2003. Criteria are being developed to exclude jobs classified above GS-15. BLS has developed a new approach for grading based on the level of supervision, with final tests scheduled for the fall and implementation in surveys by December 2003. Criteria are being developed to exclude jobs classified above GS-15. The council has concerns about the reliability of NCS data for locality payments in 2004. The council recommended phasing in NCS data for locality payments in 2004 but expressed concerns about its reliability. They suggested that further implementation of NCS data should be dependent on BLS making improvements and increasing sample sizes in areas with significant pay gaps. Metropolitan areas for locality pay areas are determined using OMB definitions. The NCS data shows a pay gap more than 5 percentage points lower than OCSP data. OPM regulations no longer automatically change locality pay areas with OMB's revised definitions of metropolitan areas. OPM modified GS locality pay regulations to align with new OMB statistical area definitions, allowing for review before decisions in 2003. Major changes considered included differences in statistical area definitions used in the locality pay program. The President's Pay Agent and Federal Salary Council reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, including changes like the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas'. Population density no longer determines outlying counties, and commuting thresholds have been adjusted. The Federal Salary Council working group reviewed new OMB definitions and commuting patterns in 2003. They recommended considering the new MSA definitions for the locality pay program, with further study needed before any decisions are made. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended using the new MSA definitions for the locality pay program, with additional study needed before making any decisions. The new definitions would impact 83 additional counties and exclude 10 counties from existing metropolitan locality pay areas. The working group suggested adopting the new MSA definitions for locality pay areas at a council meeting in October 2003. The working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, including changes to pay area definitions and merging certain pay areas to save resources. The council approved these recommendations in a report to the Pay Agent. The working group recommended changes to locality pay areas, including merging certain pay areas to save resources. The council adopted these recommendations in a report to the Pay Agent, which tentatively approved them for the January 2005 pay adjustments. In 2004, OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register for public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed to by the House of Representatives, stating the sense of Congress on funds availability for Transportation/Treasury. An amendment to H.R. 2989 offered by Representative Sam Farr was agreed to by the House of Representatives, stating that funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Farr also testified about potential pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Representative Farr testified about potential pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California, and Senator Jack Reed offered an amendment to prevent the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area in the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill. The amendment in the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill on October 23, 2003, prevented the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This provision was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Transportation/Treasury bill in Section 644, enacted as Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004, prohibits funds from implementing regulations inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations for locality pay areas in FY2004. The Pay Agent's report recommended against locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. The Pay Agent recommended against locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, suggesting alternative approaches to federal employee compensation. The cost of the January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion. The Pay Agent's report recommended against locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. The cost of the locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion to reduce the pay disparity. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area. They believe changes in locality pay area boundaries should be made after reviewing new commuting patterns data and metropolitan area definitions. Improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, focusing on issues with job selection and grading, with further enhancements planned for December 2003. The Pay Agent looks forward to reviewing the results. Improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, focusing on job selection and grading. The Pay Agent looks forward to reviewing the results of the data next year. Once annual and locality pay percentages are determined, pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) and adding locality payments. President George W. Bush's FY2004 budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, but did not specify how it would be allocated between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA in January 2004. The statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2004 is 2.7%, and any changes would need to be submitted as an alternative. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay. The cost of the adjustment would be about $2 billion dollars. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented the plan, which also included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The President's alternative plan in December 2003 included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The fund was authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136, with a recommended appropriation of $2.5 million in H.R. 2989. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a $2.5 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989. Funding was contingent upon the creation of the fund within OPM and approval of performance pay plans for agencies. OPM was directed to report annually on approved plans and obligated amounts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. They believed such initiatives should be budgeted and managed within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate, but it was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The report accompanying the bill stated that funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. H.R. 2989 was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, providing $1 million for the fund. The funding transfer is contingent upon OPM approval of an agency's performance pay plan. The funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund was contingent upon the enactment of legislation to establish the fund within OPM. Funds cannot be transferred to any federal agency without OPM director approval. The provision was enacted in P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The President's alternative plan mentioned that any pay raise above 2 percent would likely be unfunded, leading agencies to absorb the additional cost and potentially freeze hiring. Federal employee union representatives expressed discouragement about the 2.0% pay raise. The President's alternative plan proposed a 2 percent pay raise, which could lead to agencies absorbing the additional cost and potentially freezing hiring. Federal employee union representatives expressed discouragement about the pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources and effort needed to maintain it. They suggested a broad-band system as an alternative. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule system due to the resources and effort needed to maintain it. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades and wider salary ranges, allowing managers to set pay based on competence and performance. Several agencies are already implementing pay banding systems. Several agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and Internal Revenue Service, are implementing pay banding systems. Pay parity provisions in P.L. 107-123 allow the SEC to raise salaries for certain employees. New HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in P.L. 107-296 and P.L. 108-136. Changes to pay setting systems at these agencies are expected to include broad pay bands, with Congress annually considering federal white-collar pay adjustments. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 authorized changes to pay setting systems at agencies, including broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, with past adjustments set by Congress. Congressional resolutions expressed the need for pay adjustment parity. In January 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Resolutions in the Senate and House expressed the need for parity between military and civilian pay increases. These resolutions are nonbinding and do not require the President's signature. Members of Congress from the Washington, DC area wrote letters urging for parity in pay adjustments. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The House Committee on the Budget passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 with a 215 to 212 vote. Members of Congress urged for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The House passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 with a 215 to 212 vote. It included language advocating for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The Senate version also supported this provision. The Senate Committee on the Budget's report on the Concurrent Budget Resolution for FY2004 included a provision for a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. This recommendation is typically included in the Transportation, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004 (H.R. 2989) proposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill was approved by the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies and the House Committee on Appropriations. On July 11, 2003, the House Committee on Appropriations approved the bill, as amended, for consideration by the full committee. On July 24, 2003, H.R. 2989 was marked up and ordered to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives. An amendment was agreed upon to provide a 4.1% pay adjustment. The bill was reported to the House on July 30, 2003. It passed the House on September 9, 2003, with a 381-39 vote. The Bush Administration opposed the pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The House passed the bill with a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. The Administration proposed a 2.0% raise, citing the need to absorb the increase within existing appropriations levels. Additionally, they suggested a Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The Administration proposed a 2.0% pay raise for civilian employees, with concerns about unfunded additional pay increases costing DOD and Government-wide. They were disappointed that the bill did not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2989 expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. It mentions that the 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases, but does not address Federal employee turnover concerns. Federal employees are reported to be satisfied with their pay rate, with a low quit rate of 1.7% per year. The curr_chunk discusses a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, which is seen as limiting agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. S. 1589, the Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, includes this pay adjustment. The full committee approved the bill on a 29-0 roll call vote on September 4, 2003. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 1589, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The full committee approved the bill on a 29-0 roll call vote on September 4, 2003, and reported the measure to the Senate on September 8, 2003. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment for the pay adjustment, which was agreed to by voice vote. The Senate passed an amendment to the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill, providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The pay increase would be absorbed within the levels appropriated in the act or previous appropriations acts. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The pay increase would be allocated as a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. This was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The 108th Congress was closing, H.R. 2989 was included in H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The conference report was agreed upon by the House on December 8, 2003, and by the Senate on January 22, 2004. A 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees was approved, effective from January 1, 2004. President Bush signed the bill on January 23, 2004. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 on January 23, 2004, which became P.L. 108-199, providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees effective from January 1, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act also included an additional 2.1% pay adjustment, with OPM issuing revised salary tables for 2004 the next day. President Bush issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, allocating a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The cost of the adjustment is approximately $4.1 billion. OPM released revised salary tables for 2004 the following day. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address the federal white-collar pay-setting system. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommend adjustments to federal white-collar pay under FEPCA, aiming to reduce the salary disparity between federal and non-federal employees to 5%. However, the target pay gaps have not been fully closed as required by law since 1994. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address this issue. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent aim to reduce the salary disparity between federal and non-federal employees to 5% under FEPCA. However, only a small percentage of the target pay gaps has been closed each year, resulting in an average pay disparity of 25.73% in 2004. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been criticized for flaws in data completeness and credibility. Despite concerns, no changes were proposed to FEPCA. Survey data from non-federal rates of pay were not approved for use in determining locality payments for certain years, leading to the aging of previous survey data. Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on this issue in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001. The President's Pay Agent was directed by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 to address methodological concerns regarding the use of survey data for locality payments. Improvements to the survey methodology are being implemented, with the Office of Personnel Management issuing a white paper on compensation in April 2002. The Office of Personnel Management issued a white paper on compensation in April 2002, reviewing current policies and the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in November 2002 compared the salaries of federal General Schedule employees with nonfederal employees in similar jobs, finding that federal employees in certain occupations tended to earn less than their private sector counterparts. Federal employees in selected professional and administrative occupations generally earn less than comparable jobs in private firms, with about 85 percent lagging behind by over 20 percent. In contrast, around 30 percent of federal employees in technical and clerical occupations have salaries higher than those in the private sector. The pay gap is smaller for technical and clerical jobs, with about three-quarters of federal employees in these roles having salaries within 10 percent of private sector levels. The Congressional Budget Office highlighted concerns about the federal pay system, noting the lack of variation in pay raises by occupation. The Congressional Budget Office found that the federal pay system lacks variation in pay raises by occupation, leading to potential disparities in salary adjustments. This could result in employees in professional and administrative roles receiving smaller raises than needed to match private sector salaries, while those in technical and clerical positions may receive higher raises than necessary. Even if fully implemented, the current system would fail to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) may not achieve its goal of providing federal pay comparable to the private sector due to disparities in salary adjustments by occupation. Implementing FEPCA fully would result in above-market salaries for some groups and below-market salaries for others, especially as professional and administrative roles increase in the federal workforce. The estimated cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with locality-based comparability payments in January 2004 projected to cost $8.830 billion. From 1985 to 2000, federal employment in professional and administrative occupations increased from 41% to 56% of total federal civilian employment. The estimated cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with projected locality-based comparability payments in January 2004 costing $8.830 billion. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) support pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal for federal pay as inadequate and disregarding FEPCA. AFGE highlights issues with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining comparability. The unions criticized the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding of FEPCA, highlighting issues with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining comparability. Bush's methodological problems with federal pay seem to have spread to the Employment Cost Index component. The methodological problems with federal pay, previously related to locality, now also affect the Employment Cost Index component. Bush has been trying to eliminate these issues for the past two years. The President's Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented. Executive Orders by President Bush provided a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment in January 2004, followed by an additional 2.1% pay adjustment in March 2004. The Executive Orders by President Bush in January and March 2004 provided pay adjustments including a 1.5% annual increase and a 0.5% locality-based payment, followed by an additional 2.1% adjustment. The pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule and adding the locality payment. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online. The new GS schedule for 2004 includes annual adjustment percentage and locality payment. Pay rates are compared with 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be accessed online at http://www.opm.gov. MSA and CMSA are defined as Metropolitan Statistical Area and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area respectively."
