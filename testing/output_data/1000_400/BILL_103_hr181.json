    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This provision includes a transitional increase amount based on former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year. The transitional increase amount is calculated for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits based on former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year of eligibility. The applicable percentage for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits in different years is as follows: 1979 - 60 percent, 1980 - 35 percent, 1981 - 30 percent, 1982 - 25 percent, and 1983 - 10 percent. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. In 1983, the applicable percentage for old-age insurance benefits is 10 percent. The term 'excess under former law' means the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The former law primary insurance amount is the amount an individual would receive based on calculations from December 1978, with certain modifications. This calculation excludes certain provisions and includes only calendar years after a specific period. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on December 1978 provisions, excluding certain rules and considering only calendar years after a specific period. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on December 1978 provisions, excluding certain rules and considering only calendar years after a specific period. This paragraph applies to individuals whose total wages and self-employment income are the largest after a certain period, with adjustments made to ensure a higher primary insurance amount than computed under a different paragraph. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987, based on specific criteria outlined in the Social Security Amendments of 1977."
