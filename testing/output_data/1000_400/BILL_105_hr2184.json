    "content": "The Act titled \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. Private security officers in the United States are growing rapidly and function as an adjunct to public law enforcement. The industry provides opportunities for entry-level job applicants and protects individuals and various properties such as banks, hospitals, and airports. Private security officers in the United States protect diverse operations like banks, hospitals, airports, and residential properties. Sworn law enforcement officers serve the public, with private security officers supplementing their services. The growth of private shopping malls means more public interaction with private security personnel. Private security personnel provide prevention and reporting services alongside sworn police officers. The increase in private shopping malls has led to more public interaction with private security personnel than with law enforcement officers. The growth of security services has accelerated as the number of public sector law enforcement officers has decreased, serving public policy goals in combating serious crimes. Despite differences in duties, the public struggles to differentiate between private security and law enforcement officers. The public demands well-trained private security personnel to complement, not replace, law enforcement officers. Private security officers should undergo thorough screening, especially those carrying weapons. SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.

Additionally, the Attorney General will report to Congress on the number of inquiries made by employers under this section after two years of the bill's enactment. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\nSubsection (d) of section 534 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include an association of employers of private security officers designated by the Attorney General for conducting background checks on employees.\n\nSEC. 5.
