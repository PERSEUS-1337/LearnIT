    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Despite these efforts, research shows that current and former foster youth face challenges compared to their peers in the general population. The law directs child welfare agencies to develop policies for older youth transitioning from care, including written case plans for services. Research shows that foster youth struggle more than their peers in adulthood, with higher rates of homelessness and reliance on public support. This has led to increased attention from policymakers and advocates. Research and efforts from policy makers and advocates have highlighted the challenges faced by youth transitioning from care. Congress has focused on providing support for youth after they reach the age of majority to help ease the transition to adulthood. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, including those for older youth in care, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Opportunities Act. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. The 113th Congress later passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, providing protections for older youth in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) provides protections for older youth in foster care, promoting normalcy and addressing sex trafficking issues. Implementation challenges of this law are a key concern as older youth transition into adulthood from foster care. This report addresses issues affecting older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood, specifically regarding the implementation of P.L. 110-351 and P.L. 113-183. One challenge is states extending foster care to older youth due to cost concerns, despite federal assistance. States must help youth develop a transition plan within 90 days of leaving care to identify available supports and services. Even with federal assistance, states may hesitate to extend care to older foster youth due to cost concerns. States are required to help youth develop a transition plan within 90 days of leaving care, but challenges remain in providing support for emancipated youth in areas such as securing health insurance, housing, and staying connected to work and school. Policy makers and advocates are concerned about the challenges faced by older foster youth and those who have aged out during the transition to adulthood. Emancipated youth struggle with forming permanent connections with adults, obtaining health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. There is limited information on youth transitioning from foster care, but a new national database may provide insights into their outcomes in education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. Additionally, there is a concern about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking, and child welfare agencies are required to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress may need to monitor the implementation of these policies. The report discusses concerns about older foster youth transitioning to adulthood, including challenges with forming connections, obtaining health insurance, and staying connected to work and school. There is also a focus on youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking, with child welfare agencies required to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress may need to monitor the implementation of these policies. The report discusses federal child welfare policies for transitioning youth from foster care, including the decline in the overall number of children in foster care over the past decade. Older children aged 13-17 comprised about 29% of the caseload in FY2002, increasing to 35% in FY2010 before declining to 34% in FY2012. The report is a companion to another report providing context on older foster youth and related federal policy. The number of children in foster care has decreased over the past decade. Older children aged 13-17 made up 29% of the caseload in FY2002, increasing to 35% in FY2010 before dropping to 34% in FY2012. The share of older youth exiting care because they reached the state's legal age of majority followed a similar trend, with a recent low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The number of youth aging out of foster care reached a recent low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012, making up 11% of all children who exited that year. Research on former foster youth shows they tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Evaluation study tracked outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The study found that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population, with lower rates of attaining a four-year college degree (2.5% versus 23.5%). Based on survey data of youth at age 26, former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to youth in general. They were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree (2.5% versus 23.5%) and had lower current employment rates and income levels. Youth in the Midwest Evaluation study faced barriers to enrolling or staying in school, such as financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Former foster youth have lower employment rates and income levels compared to their peers. The state child welfare agency is responsible for children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect, using federal and state funds to reunite them with their parents or find a permanent home. Title IV-E foster care is a primary federal funding source for this purpose. The federal and state funds aim to help children reunite safely with their parents or find a permanent home. Title IV-E foster care is a key federal funding source for this purpose, requiring states to promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all children in foster care through written case plans and regular reviews. The written case plan for children in foster care must detail placement and services for a permanent home, reviewed every 6 months by a judge or panel. For youth 14 and older, the plan includes programs for transition to adulthood. Permanency hearings involve consulting with the child in an age-appropriate manner. For youth age 14 and older in foster care, the case plan must include programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood. The plan also includes listing certain rights regarding education, health, visitation, and court participation, as well as the provision of identification documents. Children must acknowledge receipt of these rights and be consulted in the development of the plan. The case plan for youth in foster care age 14 and older must include programs for transition to adulthood and rights regarding education, health, visitation, and court participation. Children must acknowledge receipt of these rights and be consulted in the plan's development. The case plan for youth in foster care age 14 and older must include programs for transition to adulthood and rights regarding education, health, visitation, and court participation. One of the individuals selected by the child can act as their advisor and advocate for the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard\" to determine participation in extracurricular activities. States must also assist youth in developing a transition plan for housing and other needs post-emancipation. Efforts are made to find adoptive parents or legal guardians for children who cannot reunite with their parents. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for emancipation. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, addressing concerns raised in hearings. It aims to find permanent homes for children who cannot reunite with their parents. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) was enacted in 2008 after Congress held hearings on child welfare reforms. It made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, including provisions for older youth in foster care. States were authorized to extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older. The 113th Congress later passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) to address the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking. States can extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 19, 20, or 21. The 113th Congress focused on older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking, passing the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) in 2014. This law protects older youth in care, promotes normalcy for children in foster care, and addresses sex trafficking of children. Federal child welfare law includes provisions for older youth in care and those aging out. The federal child welfare law includes provisions for older youth in care and those aging out, such as funding for Title IV-E foster care program to support eligible children in out-of-home foster care. States and Indian tribes can seek federal funds for room and board costs. The law also addresses sex trafficking of children and promotes normalcy for children in foster care. The Title IV-E foster care program provides federal funding to support eligible children in out-of-home foster care. Eligibility criteria include being in the care of the state, meeting certain age and family structure requirements, and being placed in a licensed setting with an eligible provider. The program aims to secure a permanent home for the child and requires the state to make reasonable efforts towards this goal. The Title IV-E foster care program provides federal funding for eligible children in out-of-home foster care. The state must ensure the child's welfare, make reasonable efforts to prevent foster care placement, and secure a permanent home. Foster care maintenance payments cover the child's basic needs and care expenses in a licensed setting. The Title IV-E foster care program provides federal funding for eligible children in out-of-home foster care, covering basic needs and care expenses. Federal reimbursement is available for children placed in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes, with additional support for eligible young people in independent living settings. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth in care. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth in care, regardless of eligibility for federal maintenance payments. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until age 18, or 19 if the child is still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting from FY2011 for eligible youth. States and tribes can provide foster care maintenance payments to youth until age 21 if they meet certain criteria, such as completing high school, pursuing post-secondary education, participating in employment-related activities, or having a medical condition that prevents them from working. The law does not specify the programs that can help with employment barriers or define medical conditions that could exempt a youth from work or education. States can provide foster care maintenance payments to youth until age 21 if they meet specific criteria, including completing high school, pursuing post-secondary education, participating in employment-related activities, or having a medical condition that prevents them from working. The law does not specify programs for employment barriers or define medical conditions exempting youth from work or education. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. A child care institution is a facility licensed by the state for up to 25 children, excluding detention facilities or training schools for delinquent youth. States can seek reimbursement for foster care for youth aged 18 or older in supervised independent living settings. HHS encourages extending foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21. HHS encourages states and tribes to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with criteria for determining eligibility based on employment, education, or medical conditions. States and tribes must submit a description of their rationale for extending assistance as part of their Title IV-E plan to receive funding. States and tribes must establish criteria to determine if youth meet employment or education conditions and verify their continued eligibility for Title IV-E assistance. Examples of eligible activities include finishing high school, pursuing a GED, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. HHS advises that students are considered enrolled even during breaks. States and tribes may establish requirements for extended foster care, such as providing assistance to youth enrolled in post-secondary education. The guidance advises offering support to youth aged 18 and older to ensure ample assistance. Program instructions address Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria for young individuals. States and tribes are advised to provide extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older to ensure ample support. Program instructions address Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria for young individuals, including those who enter care at age 18 or older. To maintain eligibility for federal foster care, youth aged 18 or older must meet Title IV-E requirements regarding income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from their home. States do not need to reassess AFDC eligibility for these youth. Youth entering or reentering care at 18 or older are evaluated based on their own circumstances, regardless of their family situation. Youth in extended care must have entered via court order or voluntary placement agreement. Removal criteria established before age 18 still apply for youth remaining in care after turning 18. Youth in extended care must have entered via court order or voluntary placement agreement. For those over 18, a court can determine if the home removal is in the youth's best interest or they can sign a voluntary placement agreement. This is subject to a judicial determination if Title IV-E payments extend beyond 180 days. The court has jurisdiction to place youth in extended care, or they can sign a voluntary placement agreement as their own guardian, subject to a judicial determination if Title IV-E payments extend beyond 180 days. State and tribal child welfare agencies can meet placement and care rules for older youth through written authorization, voluntary placement agreements, or court orders. Youth in extended care can be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. P.L. 110-351 allows youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations for independent living settings, leaving it up to states and tribes to develop appropriate arrangements. The instructions allow states and tribes to develop supervised independent living settings for young people to live independently, including host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in supervised independent living settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care in a developmentally appropriate manner. Case plans for youth age 18 and older should address their needs and include benchmarks developed jointly with the youth. The program instructions require child welfare agencies to apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care, focusing on their needs and independence. Case plans for youth age 18 and older should include benchmarks developed jointly with the youth to indicate when independence can be achieved. Permanency plans for older youth should be finalized every 12 months, with a goal of emancipation or independence. States and tribes are also required to make reasonable efforts to prepare young people for independence. The guidance emphasizes the importance of finalizing a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered placements, with a focus on emancipation or independence goals. The court can determine the plan without a hearing, and states are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements for youth ineligible for federal foster care. The program guidance advises states and tribes that choose to extend care to youth ineligible for federal foster care are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements. Nearly half of jurisdictions had amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend the maximum age of foster care. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions had amended their Title IV-E state plans to extend foster care eligibility to youth who remain in care after age 18 and receive federal foster care maintenance payments. HHS approved plans for 18 states and the District of Columbia to extend care until age 21, with Indiana and Nebraska extending care to ages 20 and 19 respectively. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to age 21, pending HHS review. States with approved plan amendments extend care until age 21, except for Indiana and Nebraska, which extend care to ages 20 and 19 respectively. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to 21, pending HHS review. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have specific conditions for youth to remain in care. States like Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have specific conditions for youth to remain in care, such as being in school or participating in a program to address barriers to employment. Other states need to consider various factors when extending care, including outcomes, costs, oversight by courts, and the type of placements for older youth. The research literature on youth who emancipate from care\u2014or stay in care beyond age 18\u2014is scarce. The Midwest Evaluation study shows that youth who remained in care as late as age 20 had somewhat more positive outcomes than those who emancipated at age 18. Outcomes for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin were examined, providing insights into the benefits of extended care for older youth. The study compared outcomes for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, showing that youth who remained in care until age 20 had better outcomes than those who emancipated at age 18. Remaining in care was linked to higher earnings and delayed pregnancy, with each additional year in care after age 18 associated with a $470 increase in average annual earnings. The Midwest Evaluation found that remaining in care past age 18 was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy for youth in Illinois. Each additional year in care after age 18 led to a $470 increase in average annual earnings. Youth who stayed in care longer saw a $924 increase in earnings after controlling for various factors. Additionally, youth in care were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. Youth in Illinois who remained in care past age 18 experienced higher earnings and a reduced risk of pregnancy. They were also more likely to receive transitional living services funded through the CFCIP. However, the benefits of staying in care seemed to diminish two years after aging out, with no significant difference in college degree attainment compared to their peers. Two years after aging out of care in Illinois, youth showed lower college degree attainment compared to their peers, possibly due to losing access to support services. Challenges in extending care include fiscal constraints and competing budget priorities. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) program and state programs that waive college tuition may not provide enough support for youth in foster care. States struggle to extend care due to budget constraints. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group to review federal policies. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative recommends states convene a planning group to review federal requirements and options for extending care for youth transitioning from foster care to adulthood. Key design issues should be agreed upon, costs projected, and input from young people sought before considering next steps. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group to discuss extending care for youth transitioning from foster care. Key design issues, costs, and input from young people should be considered before moving forward. Studies show benefits of extending foster care, including offsetting costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. Extending foster care can offset costs to individuals and society, such as state prison admissions and welfare payments. A study in Illinois estimated the annual cost of extending care to be around $20,800, with benefits including increased wages for youth. Researchers estimated the annual cost of extending foster care to be about $20,800, with potential benefits including increased wages for youth. The analysis found an average return of about $2 for every $1 spent on a youth remaining in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over the youth's lifetime. The analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts. The analysis found that extending foster care could result in an additional $72,000 earned over a youth's lifetime. It did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, nor did it examine potential benefits to society such as higher tax revenues and reductions in homelessness. Eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments varies by state, with just under half of children meeting the criteria. Extending foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a consideration for most states. Just under half of children meet the criteria for federal foster care maintenance payments, which varies by state. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. Eligibility for Title IV-E includes income/assets tests, family structure rules, judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. Currently, Title IV-E eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments is based on income/assets tests, family structure rules, judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. Reimbursement rates vary based on the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, ranging from 50% to 73%. States are not explicitly required to make payments for children ineligible for federal foster care. The federal government reimburses states for program administration and training costs in foster care. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible due to expenses. States are responsible for covering costs for children who do not meet IV-E eligibility criteria. Extending care only to certain youth may raise equity concerns. States could establish different reimbursement levels for eligible youth extending care beyond their 18th birthday. States can extend care to youth beyond their 18th birthday if they meet certain criteria, such as attending school or working. HHS advises that states can make remaining in care conditional upon pursuing specific pathways. States can extend care to youth beyond their 18th birthday based on specific criteria, such as attending school or working. However, some states restrict eligibility for extended foster care based on certain activities, which may raise equity concerns. For example, limiting extended care only to youth in post-secondary education could reinforce unequal opportunities for youth in care. Federal child welfare law gives state courts the responsibility to oversee the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of their eligibility for extended care. This ensures that each child has a suitable permanency goal, regardless of how they entered care. The state courts play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of their eligibility for extended care. A case review must be conducted every six months to assess progress and address the reasons for the child entering care. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of removal, determined at a permanency hearing in court or by a court-appointed/administrative body. The state courts ensure the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, conducting case reviews every six months. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of removal, determined at a hearing in court or by a court-appointed/administrative body. HHS program instructions state that case review system protections apply to all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility. HHS program instructions state that case review system protections apply to all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under a voluntary placement agreement, but a case review must be conducted every six months. States can exclude children who have reached the age of majority and are not receiving Title IV-E payments from court oversight. Extending care beyond age 18 could result in different levels of services. In states that extend care beyond age 18, different levels of services may be provided based on IV-E eligibility. Non-IV-E eligible youth may not receive the same oversight and supervision as IV-E eligible youth, leading to potential gaps in meeting their needs. This lack of information on non-IV-E eligible youth hinders policymakers from ensuring all young adults in extended care are adequately supported. The American Bar Association (ABA) recommends that states enact legislation to ensure juvenile court involvement can continue beyond age 18 for older youth in care, holding child welfare agencies and others accountable for meeting legal requirements. The ABA recommends legislation for juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care, emphasizing accountability and youth participation in hearings. Stakeholders urge reconceptualization of foster care for those over 18 to provide tailored support. Some stakeholders advocate for a reimagining of foster care for youth aged 18 and older to provide tailored support, as they transition from having little autonomy to being largely independent. Young people in foster care face anxiety about aging out of the system and transitioning to independence. Simply extending traditional foster care is not enough to support their needs. Extended care should be developmentally appropriate, geared towards young adults, address trauma and loss, and involve them in decision-making. Extended care for young adults in foster care should be developmentally appropriate, addressing trauma and loss, and involving them in decision-making. Research on adolescent brain development highlights the need for strong social supports during the transition to adulthood, allowing for learning from mistakes and taking on increasing responsibility. Permanent connections should also be emphasized in extended care. Extended care for young adults in foster care should involve graduated levels of supervision and support, redesigning case planning to allow for earlier roles and responsibilities. It emphasizes the importance of young people making and learning from mistakes, developing permanent connections, and having healthy relationships. The approach should focus on empowering young people to drive their connections and provide experiences for increased skills development. Extended care for young adults in foster care involves graduated levels of supervision and support, redesigning case planning for earlier roles and responsibilities, and empowering youth to build social networks and autonomy. Research also focuses on factors influencing youth remaining in extended care, with a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children identifying reasons for youth not staying in care despite state policies. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers found that in Illinois, youth in the Cook County region are more likely to remain in care beyond age 18 compared to other regions. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were identified through data evaluation, surveys, focus groups, and interviews. In Illinois, factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were identified through data evaluation, surveys, focus groups, and interviews. Some factors include juvenile courts playing an active role in retaining youth, stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws and policies, and regions with few appropriate foster care placements leading to youth leaving care after age 18. In Illinois, factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were identified through data evaluation, surveys, focus groups, and interviews. Stakeholders in the child welfare system did not have a uniform understanding of laws and policies that allow youth to remain in care until age 21. Regions with few appropriate foster care placements led to youth leaving care after age 18. Youth who had stable and supportive relationships tended to remain in care longer. Youth attitudes about staying in care beyond the age of majority were identified as a challenge in keeping them in care. In Illinois, factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were identified through data evaluation, surveys, focus groups, and interviews. Stakeholders in the child welfare system did not have a uniform understanding of laws and policies that allow youth to remain in care until age 21. Regions with few appropriate foster care placements led to youth leaving care after age 18. Youth who had stable and supportive relationships tended to remain in care longer. Youth attitudes about staying in care beyond the age of majority were identified as a challenge in keeping them in care. States can extend foster care assistance to youth up to age 19, 20, or 21, allowing them to return to care if needed. The July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS allow states and tribes to extend foster care assistance, enabling youth to stay in care continuously or leave and return after turning 18. A 2014 report by the GAO found that 19 states have policies for youth to leave and re-enter care, with 12 states allowing youth to stay in care under voluntary placement agreements. Youth who remain in foster care at age 18 and older may live independently in a supervised setting. In 12 of 19 states, youth can stay in foster care under voluntary agreements. For those over 18, they may live independently in supervised settings. HHS has not clarified regulations on independent living arrangements. States have not received clear guidance on overseeing youth in independent living settings, where child welfare agencies provide supervision. Advocates emphasize the importance of young adults in care learning adult skills while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues, such as purchasing units or contracting with organizations. Young adults in care should learn adult skills while receiving state support in independent living settings. States must consider issues like purchasing units, screening residents, rent coverage, visit frequency, responsibility for lease violations, and progression to different settings. In independent living settings for youth in care, case workers visit regularly to monitor progress and provide support. Youth are responsible for lease violations and damages, and can move to different settings based on their progress. States face challenges in finding suitable housing options for these youth. In independent living settings for youth in care, states provide supervised housing options such as apartments, homes, and dorms. Challenges include finding appropriate housing and supporting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Roommates are allowed, but living with parents or significant others is not permitted. Licensing for independent living settings is not required. To support youth in independent living settings, states offer housing options like apartments and dorms. Roommates are allowed, but living with parents or significant others is not permitted. Each county has discretion on background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth who have left foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship. States and tribes can choose to provide adoption assistance. As of FY2011, states and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Additionally, older youth with medical conditions preventing participation can also be covered. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21 and meet certain criteria such as being enrolled in school, employed, or participating in activities to promote employment. Older youth with medical conditions preventing participation can also be covered. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21 and meet certain criteria such as being enrolled in school, employed, or participating in activities to promote employment. The child must have been residing for at least six consecutive months in the home of the prospective relative guardian for kinship guardianship assistance. HHS's program instructions allow states to extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties, tribal kin, extended family and friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. States and tribes may establish conditions for a person to qualify as a child's guardian or enter into a legal guardianship. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can encompass biological, legal, tribal, extended family, and fictive kin. States and tribes can set conditions for guardianship, like a child being in care for over six months or targeting certain age groups. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports youth expected to emancipate from foster care, offering services to aid in their transition to self-sufficiency. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care, helping them transition to self-sufficiency, obtain employment, and access postsecondary education. The program also offers personal and emotional support through mentors and adults, connects former foster youth to employment, education, housing, and other services, and encourages personal responsibility in preparing for adulthood. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports youth transitioning from foster care to self-sufficiency through mentors and adult support. It connects former foster youth to employment, education, housing, and other services, promoting personal responsibility in preparing for adulthood. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to provide independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16. P.L. 113-183 added a purpose area to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 engage in appropriate activities. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) added a purpose area to the Chafee program to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides funding to states and tribes based on their foster care population, with a minimum allocation of $500,000 or the amount received in FY1998. States must provide a 20% match and use the funds for independent living programs for youth transitioning from foster care. States must provide a 20% match for funding from the CFCIP to develop independent living programs for youth transitioning from foster care. These programs offer services like housing, education, career exploration, counseling, and mentoring. To be eligible for CFCIP funds, states and tribes must outline their independent living program in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages. States and tribes must outline in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan how they will implement their independent living program, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages. They must also certify that they meet specific requirements, such as limiting the use of program funds for room and board of youth ages 18 to 21. Additionally, the Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program provides support for children who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. The Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth in foster care to attend higher education. Congress allocated $60 million for the program, with approximately $45 million being appropriated each year. Eligible students must be in good academic standing to receive the vouchers. The Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth in foster care to attend higher education. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. Independent living services are also available for youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. The Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) offers up to $5,000 annually for eligible foster youth to attend higher education. Independent living services are available for youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18, with a focus on connecting them to school, work, and resources until age 21. States have discretion in defining which youth will receive services, and must ensure that youth participate in age-appropriate activities. States have discretion in defining which youth will receive services under the Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) for foster youth. They must ensure that youth participate in age-appropriate activities and develop a transition plan with housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services before turning 18. The transition plan for foster youth must include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It should be developed by the youth with assistance from representatives and implemented 90 days before their 18th birthday. Additionally, the plan must designate an individual to make healthcare decisions if the youth becomes unable to do so. The transition plan for foster youth under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program must address designating a healthcare decision-maker if the youth is unable to do so. This plan is separate from the case plan required for every child in foster care. The transition plan for foster youth must include options for healthcare decision-making and services post-custody. It is separate from the case plan required for children in foster care, which outlines placement and care while in custody. For youth 16 and older, the case plan also addresses programs for transitioning to adulthood. The transition plan for foster youth includes options for healthcare and services post-custody. It is separate from the case plan, which outlines placement and care while in custody. For youth 16 and older, the case plan addresses programs for transitioning to adulthood and must be reviewed annually by a court. The transition plan for foster youth, directed by the youth in consultation with others, includes housing options and can be detailed as desired. It is not reviewed by a court but is encouraged to be started well in advance of the 90-day period. Additional guidance on the transition plan was provided in July 2010 by HHS. Transition planning for foster youth is encouraged to start well in advance of the 90-day period, with a focus on assisting young people in making the transition from foster care. The transition plan is not required for youth who leave foster care more than 90 days before turning 18, raising concerns for those who emancipate at age 17. Without a transition plan, these youth may be less prepared than their peers who emancipate at older ages. Transition planning for youth emancipating from care at age 17 is crucial to ensure they are prepared for independence. States and tribes may not provide transition plans for youth leaving care between ages 18 and 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance on engaging youth and stakeholders in the transition planning process to help them achieve permanency with caring adults. Transition planning for youth aging out of care is essential to prepare them for independence. Social work professionals are developing guidance to engage youth and stakeholders in the process, focusing on achieving permanency with caring adults. States have adopted policies to involve youth in transition planning and provide necessary support. In a 2014 report, GAO found that states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care, ensuring youth input is documented and key documents are included in the plan. Some jurisdictions require a separate transition plan and assistance from a specialist, but challenges still exist. Several jurisdictions require a separate transition plan for youth in foster care, with over half mandating the involvement of a transition planning specialist. Challenges include staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding suitable housing for transitioning youth. States like Hawaii and Nebraska have developed detailed transition planning processes, including holding \"circles\" to celebrate the young person's transition to adulthood. In Hawaii and Nebraska, transition planning processes involve youth and their support systems in \"circles\" to celebrate adulthood and plan for the future. Foster Club in Nebraska provides a transition planning kit for older youth, outlining roles of the transition plan team and courts. Foster Club in Nebraska has developed a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, outlining specific options for transportation, spirituality, and support. The kit includes a transition proposal checklist, a \"permanency pact\" to identify supportive individuals, and is revisited at key intervals before aging out. Despite policy changes, concerns remain among child welfare advocates. Policy makers and child welfare advocates are concerned about the challenges faced by older foster youth transitioning to adulthood. Research shows difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database may provide insights into outcomes in education, employment, and other areas for youth transitioning from foster care. Policy makers and child welfare advocates are concerned about the challenges faced by older foster youth transitioning to adulthood, including forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database may provide insights into outcomes for youth transitioning from foster care, while recent focus has been on increasing protections for vulnerable children and responding to youth in foster care vulnerable to sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address these issues. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) aims to address issues faced by youth in foster care vulnerable to sex trafficking. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth shows that at age 26, these youth were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents. Alumni reported varying levels of closeness with their biological families. The study on former foster youth at age 26 shows they were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents. Alumni reported varying levels of closeness with their biological families. Former foster youth in the study lacked strong relationships with some relatives after leaving care. Child welfare practitioners advocate for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by promoting long-term connections with caring adults, which can provide support for successful outcomes. Some jurisdictions ensure permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care. Permanency involves a stable relationship with a committed adult, offering safety, stability, and legal support. In some jurisdictions, child welfare agencies ensure permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care. Permanency involves a stable, secure relationship with a committed adult, providing unconditional support. Practitioners help youth identify and develop these connections through various processes, including pursuing adoptive relationships and building relationships with caring adults like teachers or mentors. Child welfare agencies aim to establish permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care through various processes, including pursuing adoptive relationships and building relationships with caring adults like teachers or mentors. Researchers advise caution in designing policies to help foster youth develop lasting connections to avoid harm from unsustainable relationships. Limited research exists on facilitating healthy relationships between foster youth and their biological family members. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before youth leave care, achieved through the case planning process. Judges determine permanency plans for children at annual hearings, including options like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with relatives. If none of these are possible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be chosen. The judge determines the permanency plan for the child at annual hearings, which may include options like returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with relatives. If none of these are possible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be chosen, with states required to provide a compelling reason for not selecting other permanency goals. APPLA was introduced as a permanent arrangement to address concerns about long-term foster care instability. Advocates introduced APPLA as a permanent arrangement for children in foster care to provide stability and a specific adult or couple to care for the child. However, concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal, replacing long-term foster care. Since the enactment of ASFA, concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal for children in foster care, replacing long-term foster care. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth highlighted the importance of achieving permanency for all children in foster care, noting that this goal is often not attained. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, co-chaired by Senators Grassley and Landrieu, issued a white paper proposing policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. The paper suggested eliminating or restricting the use of APPLA as a case plan goal, emphasizing the importance of achieving permanency for all children in care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act incorporates some of these recommendations. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. The law requires additional requirements for children with an APPLA plan during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. For children in foster care under an Indian tribe, the effective date is three years after the bill's enactment. Additional requirements are mandated for children with an APPLA plan during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews to ensure the state continues to seek a permanent family, the court reassesses the appropriateness of APPLA as a permanency plan, and the child is consulted on their desired outcome. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood. The court is revisiting whether APPLA is a suitable permanency plan for the child, ensuring the child is consulted on their desired outcome. The transition plan requirement helps youth form permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. Changes to federal child welfare law may assist youth in achieving permanency, such as amending written case plan requirements to include steps for a permanent living arrangement upon emancipation. Changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by amending written case plan requirements to include steps for a permanent living arrangement upon emancipation. The case plan should also document efforts to find a permanent placement with a family or adult connection for older youth. GAO's 2014 report found that 36 jurisdictions require intensive efforts to ensure young people have adult connections in their transition planning process. The transition planning process for youth aging out of foster care includes efforts to establish adult connections and permanent living arrangements. In Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults who can provide support after leaving care. Foster Club's Permanency Pact aims to help youth connect with supportive adults. The Permanency Pact program helps youth aging out of foster care connect with supportive adults for emotional and tangible support. Efforts to support permanency also include adoption for older youth through projects like Adoption Opportunity Grants. The Adoption Opportunity Grants funded projects to support adoption for older youth, demonstrating effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections. Federal grants could also fund mentoring programs for current and former foster youth. The federal grants funded 10 projects nationwide to support current and former foster youth. Legislation in Congress aims to authorize funding for mentoring programs for foster children, with grants going to states and other entities to establish and expand mentoring networks. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety, well-being, and permanency of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention. State and local child welfare agencies work with public and private entities to provide mentoring for child victims of sex trafficking. These agencies are responsible for ensuring the safety and well-being of all children, including those in foster care who may be vulnerable to trafficking. However, the capacity of these agencies to respond to the needs of sex trafficking victims is believed to be limited due to factors such as inadequate training and resources, high caseloads, and the perception that victims should be handled in the juvenile justice system. Children in foster care are seen as highly at risk for sex trafficking. State and local child welfare agencies may struggle to respond effectively due to lack of training, resources, and high caseloads. There are challenges in identifying cases involving trafficked children, as perpetrators may not be parents or caregivers. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to address child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across multiple sectors to address child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to respond effectively to child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. The procedures must involve collaboration with various agencies and ensure relevant training for caseworkers. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop procedures in consultation with various agencies to identify and assist children at risk of sex trafficking. These procedures must include training for caseworkers and be implemented within two years of enactment. State agencies are required to report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours of receiving information, and annually report the total number of children affected to HHS within three years. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours of receiving information. State agencies must also annually report the total number of children affected to HHS within three years. Additionally, HHS is required to report to Congress and the public the total number of children reported as victims of sex trafficking by state child welfare agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to report child victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours. HHS must submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide services for these children. Additionally, HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days of the bill's enactment to advise on policies and best practices for combating domestic sex trafficking of minors. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking, established under the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, advises the HHS Secretary and Attorney General on policies to combat domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress should monitor state implementation of reporting child victims and providing services, including guidance, serving non-foster care youth, victim reporting, and best practices. HHS provides guidance to states on child sex trafficking, including serving youth not in foster care, reporting victims, and best practices. State child welfare agencies are required to serve only children and youth already in the system. Congress may consider the extent of agencies' responsibilities in screening for victims. Legislation like H.R. 5081 aims to require state agencies to have these responsibilities. Pending legislation like H.R. 5081 would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Children in foster care homes may go missing due to abuse and neglect, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Some child welfare stakeholders are advocating for a more uniform and robust response to children missing from care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies on responding to missing children from care, requiring them to develop protocols for locating missing children. The Child Welfare League of America's 2004 survey found that many states have policies in place to prevent and recover missing children from foster care, but implementation varies across jurisdictions. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from care, including determining factors contributing to their disappearance and reporting any related information as required by HHS. These protocols must be implemented within one year of the law's enactment. State child welfare agencies are required to develop protocols for locating missing children from care, including determining factors contributing to their disappearance and reporting any related information as required by HHS. These protocols must be implemented within one year of the law's enactment. Additionally, agencies must report information on missing children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authorities for inclusion in the FBI's National Crime Information Center database. Children missing from care raise issues about the role of child welfare agencies and the federal government in responding to these cases. The Child Welfare League of America issued guidelines in 2005 for state child welfare agencies to have procedures in place to address missing children from care, including recruiting and training a competent workforce, involving relevant parties in decision-making, and examining the structure of foster and group homes. The Child Welfare League of America guidelines in 2005 emphasize the importance of maintaining caseload standards, involving all relevant parties in decision-making, examining foster care structures, and taking remedial action to address missing children from care. States vary in defining \"missing\" children, raising questions about reporting to law enforcement agencies. States vary in defining \"missing\" children, which raises questions about reporting all missing children to law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies may not always respond vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, due to competing demands and limited resources. Law enforcement agencies may not respond vigorously to certain types of missing incidents like frequent runaways due to competing demands and limited resources. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts can help prevent children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy outlines requirements for these agencies. The coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy provides general requirements for collaboration. Guidelines from CWLA and NCMEC emphasize the importance of delineating roles and sharing clear definitions of missing children. Little is known about children missing from foster care, and state child welfare agencies must report on runaways through AFCARS. Currently, state child welfare agencies report on runaways through AFCARS, but there is a lack of information on children missing from foster care due to the reporting system's limitations. States may need to track missing children more comprehensively to locate those who are no longer living where they were placed. Child welfare stakeholders have concerns about limitations on foster youth participating in normal activities due to safety policies. This includes restrictions on sleepovers, dating, phone use, obtaining a driver's license, and driving. Witnesses at a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing testified about the restrictions foster youth face, such as limitations on activities like sleepovers, dating, phone use, obtaining a driver's license, and driving. They emphasized that youth naturally seek independence and may engage in risky behaviors, which could lead to injury due to changes in brain development during adolescence. Prior to the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, federal child welfare provisions did not specifically address promoting normalcy for youth in foster care. Witnesses explained that teenagers' brain development during adolescence leads to increased risk-taking behaviors. Congress will monitor the implementation of the law's provisions one year after they go into effect. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for caregivers. HHS is tasked with helping states implement best practices for foster parents to apply this standard, and child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages and the standard. Congress will monitor the law's implementation one year after enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for caregivers. HHS must assist states in implementing best practices for foster parents to apply this standard, and child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages. States are required to revise licensing standards for foster family homes and child care institutions to reflect provisions around normalcy. Youth aging out of foster care face challenges with adequate and affordable housing. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for caregivers. States are required to revise licensing standards for foster family homes and child care institutions to reflect provisions around normalcy. A major concern for youth aging out of foster care is the lack of adequate and affordable housing, leading to homelessness and couch surfing among former foster youth. The evaluation of outcomes for foster youth in three Midwestern states revealed that 24% of 23-year-olds experienced homelessness after exiting care. Many emancipated youth resort to couch surfing, staying with family or friends temporarily. Factors influencing housing status include individual characteristics, involvement with the child welfare system, and the housing market. Lack of housing can impact a youth's ability to stay in school and maintain stability. Youth who lack housing may struggle to stay in school or keep a job. While states can use CFCIP funds for room and board, it may not be enough. Nonprofit housing programs can help former foster youth find affordable housing. Former foster youth may access housing programs run by nonprofit organizations, often in partnership with housing developers or property management agencies. A review of 60 programs in 21 states and DC found options like single-site locations, scattered-site housing, and host homes. These programs focus on independent living support, requiring youth to work or attend school, but none have been rigorously evaluated for preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. Some housing programs for former foster youth focus on independent living support, requiring them to work or attend school. However, these programs have not been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. States face challenges in finding appropriate housing options for these youth, especially during school breaks when college facilities are closed. Some states require public universities to provide housing for current and former foster youth in college, addressing housing challenges during school breaks. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for youth in foster care, including housing support. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for youth in foster care, including housing support during breaks in the academic year. It allows additional funds for demonstration projects providing comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13, including housing assistance. The Higher Education Act allows funds for demonstration projects to support students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13, including housing assistance during breaks in the academic year. Additionally, federal law permits owners of properties with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to designate units for low-income students who were in foster care. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care and certain other groups are at higher risk of becoming disconnected. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care and certain other groups are at higher risk of becoming disconnected. A study on youth who aged out of care in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina showed that at age 24, three out of five were working, with lower rates compared to national and low-income youth, and earning less than their counterparts. At age 24, three out of five youth who aged out of foster care in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina were working, earning less than their counterparts nationally. These young people also faced challenges in education, experiencing multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent support. Foster care alumni were less likely to attend college. Foster care alumni face challenges in education, including multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent support. By age 26, only about 7% of youth who aged out of care attained a degree, compared to one-third of the general youth population. Additional supports such as academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance, including year-round housing, may be beneficial for young foster care alumni to complete their education. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in foster care, with state agencies also required to provide support. Young foster care alumni may need additional supports to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance. Federal child welfare law mandates that state agencies address the educational needs of youth in foster care, ensuring placement proximity to schools and inclusion of education-related records in case plans. Collaboration with state and local education authorities is also required. The law mandates that state child welfare agencies must include education-related records in a child's case plan and work with education authorities to ensure continuity in schooling for children in foster care. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" and must assure educational support for children in foster care under the Title IV-E plan. The law mandates that states must ensure educational support for children in foster care, including enrollment in a new school and transportation to their \"school of origin\" at the same reimbursement rate as foster care maintenance payments. Additionally, states must assure that foster youth receiving federal assistance are enrolled in school or have completed high school, and educational records must be reviewed and updated for each foster care placement. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations, including foster youth. A summit in November 2011 brought together state teams to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Despite collaboration, federal education law does not address their needs. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children and youth. Recent legislation, such as S. 1094, aims to improve educational access for children in foster care by amending federal education law to align with child welfare provisions. This bill would require state education agencies to ensure that foster children remain in their current school or be promptly placed in a suitable alternative. The bill in the 113th Congress aims to amend federal education law to align with child welfare provisions for children in foster care. It requires state education agencies to ensure foster children stay in their current school or promptly enroll in a new one, with policies for credit transfers. Federal education law also addresses postsecondary educational needs of foster youth through the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act includes provisions for supportive educational services for foster youth, including Trio programs that offer mentoring, tutoring, and other support services. These programs aim to identify and prepare disadvantaged students for higher education, provide support while in college, and train service providers. The Trio programs, including Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers, aim to support disadvantaged students for higher education. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form for foster care identification. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of these services and the outcomes of former foster youth. Current studies have not shown significant improvements in outcomes, and there is a lack of national data on the transition to adulthood for former foster youth. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main source of funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of these services and outcomes for former foster youth. National data on the transition to adulthood for former foster youth is lacking, with the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) being implemented to provide insight in the future. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in foster care. States receive $140 million annually based on the number of children in care, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 68.9% of states spend additional funds on independent living services. This suggests that federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to fully support their programs. States could benefit from learning about the most effective services. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in foster care, with states receiving $140 million annually and a 20% match requirement. Additional funds may be needed for states to fully support their programs, as federal funding alone may not be sufficient. Learning about the most effective services could benefit states, as research literature on independent living programs is limited. HHS conducted evaluations of innovative programs to determine their effectiveness in achieving key outcomes. HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate independent living programs for foster youth funded by P.L. 106-169. The evaluation aimed to assess the programs' impact on educational attainment, employment rates, interpersonal skills, non-marital pregnancies, delinquency, and crime rates. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts, including employment services, life skills training, and tutoring/mentoring programs. The evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth funded by P.L. 106-169 included four programs in California and Massachusetts. 1,400 youth were assigned to intervention and control groups and surveyed at three points over two years. In-person interviews and focus groups were conducted with youth, program administrators, and community advocates to gather data on child and family demographics, placement history, and physical and mental health. The evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth in California and Massachusetts found no significant impacts overall. However, the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care showed positive impacts on education outcomes. The program aims to help youth prepare for independent living and establish permanent connections with caring adults. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care (Outreach) showed positive impacts on education outcomes. The program assists youth in preparing for independent living and establishing permanent connections with caring adults. It aims to help youth achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding high-risk behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services with a focus on empowering youth to make positive decisions about their lives. The Outreach program offers tailored services to youth, emphasizing empowerment and positive decision-making. Social workers oversee small caseloads, building close relationships with youth to assist with tasks like obtaining licenses, applying for college, and finding employment. The program aims to help youth transition to adulthood successfully, with outcomes showing higher college enrollment rates among Outreach participants compared to the control group. The evaluation of the Outreach program focused on educational, employment, and other outcomes for youth transitioning to adulthood. Outreach youth had higher college enrollment rates and were more likely to stay enrolled. They also received more help in various areas and were more likely to remain in foster care. Remaining in care and enrolling in college were found to be closely linked. The evaluation of the Outreach program found that youth who received more assistance in educational, employment, money management, and housing were more likely to stay in care and enroll in college. However, the program did not show significant improvements in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living tasks. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The evaluation of the Outreach program raises questions about the efficacy of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of foster youth but states have reported limited information to the database. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), authorized by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act (P.L. 106-169), tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth. States have reported limited information to the database, which is intended to provide insight into foster youth outcomes and identify effective approaches to serving them. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), established by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act, aims to develop outcome measures for assessing state performance in independent living programs. States began collecting data on youth in FY2011 as part of the NYTD, which is used for data collection and reporting activities. The final rule for the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) became effective in April 2008, requiring states to collect data on youth receiving independent living services starting in FY2011. The data includes information on their foster care status and outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. States collect data on the outcomes of current and former foster youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive independent living services. States have the option to track a sample of youth to reduce data collection burden, with financial penalties for non-compliance."
