The Corps maintains infrastructure like navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams through dredging and water management. Maintenance and construction costs are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates and maintains commercial waterways, including navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams, through dredging and water management. Costs are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry. Congress is considering future financing for inland waterway system investments. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the commercial industry share costs for maintaining waterways. Congress is debating how to finance future inland waterway investments due to the current revenue source being insufficient. This shortfall limits new construction projects, prompting proposals for changes in the financing system. Recent proposals highlight issues with inland waterways, including the debate over financing through fuel tax or lock usage fees. The use of inland waterways for transport dates back to before the nation's founding, with development initially left to states until federal authority was established in 1824. Inland waterways have been used for commercial transport since before the nation's founding. Initially managed by states, federal authority was established in 1824 to support interstate commerce. Despite decreased reliance due to rail and highway improvements, they still play a significant role in transporting goods, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. Inland waterways are a vital part of the nation's transportation mix, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. They are crucial for transporting bulk goods over long distances, especially for commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and metals. Inland waterways play a significant role in transporting bulk goods like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and metals. While overall freight tonnage is increasing, traffic on inland waterways has remained relatively flat over the past 20 years. The Department of Transportation predicts that overall freight tonnage will double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic growing at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. Freight shipping has been increasing at a rate of 1.2% annually from 1997 to 2007 and is expected to continue growing. The Department of Transportation projects that overall freight tonnage will double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic growing at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with a history of investment dating back to the early 1800s. Inland waterways are crucial for transporting goods, with the Mississippi and Ohio River System handling 90% of traffic. The federal government has a long history of investing in these waterways, with funding provided for investigations, operations, maintenance, and construction costs through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements, transforming the financing system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established the current financing framework. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 introduced user cost-sharing requirements for inland waterway projects, creating a fuel tax on commercial barges and a trust fund to fund construction investments. This shifted financial responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and a trust fund to hold revenues for construction investments. This increased financial responsibility for commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 increased the fuel tax on commercial barges, set to rise to $0.20 per gallon in 1994. It established cost-sharing for inland waterway projects, with 50% funding from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Operations and maintenance costs remained a federal responsibility. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a 50/50 cost-sharing for inland waterway projects, with 50% funding from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Operations and maintenance costs remained a federal responsibility. Projects funded by the IWTF require authorization and annual appropriations from Congress as per WRDA 1986. Additional projects have been authorized by subsequent Water Resources Development Acts. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a 50/50 cost-sharing for inland waterway projects, with funding from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Congress authorizes projects and appropriations annually, with federal funding covering operations and maintenance costs. WRDA 1986 also created the Inland Waterways Users Board as a federal advisory committee. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 as a federal advisory committee to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. The board meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects, with a focus on informing federal decision-making. The IWTF balance has varied significantly between 1986 and 2011. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. It meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects. The IWTF balance varied between 1986 and 2011, with balances increasing from 1992 to 2002. Proposals to increase fees on the user industry and require IWTF funding for operations and maintenance were not enacted by Congress. Appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly starting in FY2005. In 2004, proposals to increase fees on the user industry and have the IWTF fund operations and maintenance were not enacted by Congress. From FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly, exceeding fuel tax collections and interest on the balance. Some projects went over cost estimates, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. Congress took \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable balance levels. Some projects exceeded cost estimates, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. Congress implemented measures to prevent unsustainable balance levels, including exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements and providing funding for inland waterway projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Congress has taken measures to limit costs to the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) for ongoing projects, including providing construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and prohibiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009. The trust fund balance has stabilized, but without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects is expected to be extremely limited in the future, with most funding going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. The trust fund balance has stabilized due to measures taken by Congress, but without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects will be limited, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Long-term options to address this situation are discussed in the \"Inland Waterway Financing Proposals\" section. Many concerns have been raised about inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 to address some of these issues, but further structural changes are still advocated for by many. In FY2006, the Corps implemented reforms to improve project delivery, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. Advocates for additional structural reforms highlight cost overruns at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project as evidence of ongoing planning and oversight needs. The estimated cost for the Olmsted project increased from $775 million to $2.9 billion in FY2014. The estimated cost for the Olmsted project has significantly increased over time due to design changes and construction methods. The project was 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with lock components finished by 2013. The dam and demolition components are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024, respectively. Concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and financing for fuel-taxed inland waterways have led to various proposals by the Bush and Obama Administrations. Recent proposals by the Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to address solvency issues with the IWTF and financing for fuel-taxed inland waterways. While Congress rejected these proposals, the Administration has presented a new recommendation to increase revenues for the IWTF. The user industry, represented by the IWUB, has also put forth its own proposal, which includes raising the fuel tax and increasing the federal share for certain inland waterway investments. Past Administrations have submitted various proposals to raise commercial user fees on inland waterways. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways, aiming to generate additional revenue for the IWTF. The fee would have phased in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size, with the goal of tying IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways, aiming to generate additional revenue for the IWTF. The fee would phase in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size, tying IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. The proposed fees ranged from $30-$80 per lockage depending on chamber length. Congress rejected this approach due to concerns about burdening lock users with higher fees. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways in their budget requests to Congress, similar to the Bush Administration's proposal. Congress rejected the idea of a lock fee, citing concerns about burdening lock users with higher fees. The FY2010 budget proposed user fees at high-traffic locks to increase efficiency and revenues, but Congress rejected the idea. Obama Administration budgets have also suggested user fees to supplement fuel tax, but Congress has generally rejected these proposals. Recent budgets assumed new revenues of around $80 million, but the long-term financing solution for inland waterways remains unresolved. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers, in addition to maintaining the existing fuel tax. Congress has rejected user fee proposals but agreed to limit revenues for inland waterways financing. The proposed solution included more detail than previous budget proposals. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to reduce the deficit. The proposal included specific revenue targets without specifying the fee amount, aiming to generate around $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The Obama Administration proposed legislation for a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers using locks to increase revenue for the IWTF. The fee amount was not specified, but revenue targets were set to generate around $1 billion over 10 years. Additional changes included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but these were not expected to bring in significant new revenues. The Obama Administration proposed a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers using locks to increase revenue for the IWTF. The fee was opposed by the user industry and was not enacted. In 2010, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed its own plan, which has become the preferred alternative of the inland waterway user industry. The IWUB report, favored by the inland waterway user industry, proposed a new financing system and other changes for inland waterways. Its primary recommendations include increasing user fees by raising the existing IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. The IWUB report recommended increasing user fees by raising the existing IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, modifying cost-share requirements for inland waterway investments, increasing overall spending on inland waterways, and enhancing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees by raising the existing IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, modifying cost-share requirements for waterway investments, and increasing overall spending on inland waterways. Other recommendations include enhancing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on fuel tax collections. This would generate approximately $112 million annually for the IWTF, allowing for balance replenishment. The tax increase would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. Additionally, the report suggests shifting more project costs to the federal government. The IWUB report proposes increasing the fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon to replenish balances. The tax increase would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. The report also suggests shifting more project costs to the federal government and exempting certain dam-related expenses from cost-sharing requirements. Additionally, a \"cap\" on IWTF funds usage is proposed to discourage construction cost overruns. The IWUB report proposes exempting certain construction and rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements under WRDA 1986. It also suggests establishing a \"cap\" on IWTF funds usage to prevent construction cost overruns. These changes would increase the federal share for new investments to approximately 70% over the next 25 years. The IWUB report proposes increasing federal funding for inland waterways, with an overall increase in funding from the IWTF and General Revenue fund. Full funding for these investments would require an average annual expenditure of approximately $380 million, a significant increase from historical averages. The proposed increase in federal funding for inland waterways would require an average annual expenditure of approximately $380 million, a significant increase from historical averages. The majority of the funding would come from the General Revenue fund initially, with federal funding covering 74% of the total required for the proposed projects over the first five years. By 2020, the proportion of funds from the trust fund would gradually increase, but federal requirements would still exceed 50% of the necessary investments. The IWUB proposal requires $1.33 billion in federal funding over the first five years, with federal funding covering 74% of the total required for proposed projects. By 2020, the trust fund's proportion of funds would gradually increase, but federal requirements would still exceed 50% of necessary investments. The report suggests more new funding from the federal government than the IWTF, with recommendations for improving cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps. The report proposes reforms to increase the involvement of the IWUB in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, including appointing IWUB representatives to project design teams, obtaining sign-off on project plans, and providing status updates. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise due to the level of nonfederal entity involvement in federal agency studies. The IWUB seeks changes in project planning and funding, prioritizing projects based on various factors. The report does not mandate funding for these projects, leaving the final decision to be made. The report prioritized projects based on asset condition, performance impact, and system improvement. Final funding decisions would still be made by Congress or the Corps. The proposal recommends criteria similar to the report for inland waterway projects. Some advocate for cost shifts away from the federal government towards user financing. The proposal suggests criteria for selecting inland waterway projects similar to those in the report. Some groups propose shifting costs from the federal government to users to address inequalities in spending and ensure true costs are covered. The Congressional Budget Office found that the current tax system for the inland waterway system does not cover fixed operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. A user fee structure to recover true costs could increase economic efficiency, but it may result in higher costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Various entities have proposed increasing inland waterway fees to achieve savings for the federal government. Several entities have proposed significant increases to inland waterway fees to achieve savings for the federal government. Recommendations include increasing user contributions and making the inland waterways \"self-funding\" to save $1.5 billion over the next five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and the CBO have proposed increasing user fees on inland waterways to make them \"self-funding\" and save $4 billion over 10 years. Specific recommendations on the structure of user fees are still pending. The 1992 CBO report suggested various forms of user fees for inland waterways, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. Different proposals aim to change the financing system by increasing investment levels and revenue sources, prompting Congress to consider the level of new investment needed. The 113th Congress made limited changes to inland waterways financing through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121), proposing new investment levels and revenue sources that would alter the current financing system. Congress is faced with questions regarding the level of new investment needed, potential changes to the fuel tax, and cost-share arrangements for inland waterways projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) made changes to inland waterways financing in the 113th Congress. It authorized project delivery recommendations, adjusted rehabilitation cost coverage, reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project, and allowed for more information on policy options. The bill did not change the inland waterways fuel tax. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Project from 50% to 15% from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Efforts were also authorized to study revenue collection efficiency, potential financing options, and convene a stakeholder roundtable to evaluate future alternatives. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding the Olmsted Project at the reduced cost-sharing requirement. The House and Senate have made changes to inland waterways financing in recent appropriations bills, including reducing the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Project. The changes enacted in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 are seen as insufficient to finance all needed waterway upgrades in the long-term. Some support standalone legislation, such as H.R. 1149, to address the long-term solvency of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Some support standalone legislation like H.R. 1149 to address the long-term solvency of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, proposing a fuel tax increase and alterations to cost-sharing. The RIVER Act proposes a $0.09 per gallon fuel tax increase and federal responsibility for dam construction and rehabilitation costs under $50 million. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways. Some issues for Congress regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways include the level and urgency of investments, aging infrastructure, expanded capacity needs, and environmental benefits of inland waterway shipping. Commercial users advocate for increased funding, while taxpayer and environmental groups oppose it, citing misrepresentation of benefits and excessive funding requests. The benefits of inland waterways are widely debated, with some groups opposing increased federal funding due to concerns about misrepresentation of benefits and excessive funding requests. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system is inadequate for future needs. The Corps may only have funding for one lock replacement project without additional revenue or appropriations, potentially delaying new construction projects. The Corps of Engineers may only have funding for one lock replacement project (Olmstead Lock on the Ohio River) through at least FY2016, potentially delaying new construction projects on inland waterways due to a lack of revenue or appropriations. Aging infrastructure and increased lock unavailability have led to calls for increased investment in inland waterways. The Corps of Engineers notes that most locks in the US are past their 50-year design age, leading to decreased efficiency on inland waterways. Some advocate for new lock construction, while others argue for maintenance to extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. The debate centers on the high costs of new lock construction. Against new locks on the Upper Mississippi River, environmental groups argue that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks for an additional 50 years at a lower cost than new construction. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits and suggest small-scale improvements instead. The Corps of Engineers relies on traffic forecasts for new navigation alternatives, which can be challenging to predict due to various factors. The Corps of Engineers relies on traffic forecasts for new navigation alternatives, which can be challenging to predict due to various factors such as commodity prices and overall price sensitivity of shippers. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by approximately 70% by 2020, with waterway traffic projected to increase by 2% per year between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests suggest that improving the efficiency of inland waterways could reduce anticipated traffic growth. The Department of Transportation projects a 2% annual increase in waterway traffic between 2010 and 2035, with a focus on freight rail and highway traffic. Shipping interests believe that enhancing inland waterway efficiency could alleviate pressure on highways and railways. Future lock upgrades may boost demand for waterways, but external factors will also play a role. Some groups argue against new lock construction based on flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks on the inland waterway system. Some groups counter industry requests for new lock construction based on flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. Critics question Corps' traffic projections as overly optimistic. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways due to their efficiency compared to other shipping modes. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways, citing studies that show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway transportation. They argue that inland waterways contribute fewer greenhouse gas emissions and offer benefits like reduced congestion and noise. Critics question the environmental benefits as a basis for new investments in barge shipping. Taxpayer and environmental groups have questioned studies on barge shipping's environmental benefits, disputing industry fuel-efficiency calculations and advocating for a more accurate comparison of fuel efficiency between barge and rail shipping. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species, citing alterations to natural flows, structural changes like locks and dams causing sedimentation and turbidity, and bank erosion from waterway traffic. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways could have adverse environmental effects. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects, such as alterations to natural flows, sedimentation, turbidity, and bank erosion from waterway traffic. Congress is considering changes to the system that finances these investments, including proposals for additional revenue like an increase to the fuel tax or new annual fees. IWUB proposes an increase to the fuel tax to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments. Some groups argue that the associated increases to federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The user industry's stance on accepting fuel tax increases without changes to cost-sharing arrangements is unclear. The Obama Administration's 2011 proposal for user fees aimed to address these issues. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. These fees would include fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users paying even higher fees. The Administration also plans to add new waterway segments to the list of fuel-taxed waterways to increase revenues. Some groups argue that the associated increases to federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The proposal includes fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users facing even higher fees. The Administration also plans to add new waterway segments to the list of fuel-taxed waterways to increase revenues. However, the IWUB and Congress have rejected the proposal, arguing that it unfairly burdens a subset of waterway users and goes against the interconnected nature of the inland waterways system. The IWUB and Congress oppose the new Administration proposal for user fees on the inland waterway system, arguing that it unfairly burdens certain users and goes against the system's interconnected nature. Major fee increases are expected to impact shippers, and the user industry is against the proposal delegating fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Previous attempts to raise revenue included lock usage fees and other fee options. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 proposed various fees to raise revenue, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas. A financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was also considered but not included in the final bill. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 proposed fees to raise revenue, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, and ton-mile charges. A financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was considered but not included in the final bill. User fees could adjust to recover capital investments by the government, potentially reducing future trust fund shortfalls. The Obama Administration proposal ties user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. The Obama Administration proposal suggests tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022 to reduce future shortfalls. Congress could also consider inflation adjustments to increase revenue for inland waterways. Congress could consider implementing an automatic inflation adjustment to increase revenue for inland waterways, potentially through a fuel tax increase or a new lockage fee. This adjustment could help address the substantial decrease in the real purchasing power of IWTF funds since 1994. If a long-term solution is not enacted to address the revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure the solvency of the trust fund, such as capping withdrawals or putting a hold on new contracts. If the IWTF revenue shortfall is not addressed, Congress may need to take measures to ensure solvency, such as capping withdrawals or putting a hold on new contracts. Options to address the shortfall include exempting IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, which would have an additional cost to taxpayers. Congress is also considering if the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is balanced. The IWUB proposal would modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-sharing requirements. This change would have an additional cost to taxpayers from the General Revenue account. Congress is also evaluating the balance of the current cost-share arrangement for these projects. The IWUB proposal aims to redefine cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements. This would shift funding for these projects to 100% federal funding from the General Revenue stream. Additionally, the proposal sets a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects. The IWUB proposes redefining cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, setting a new $100 million threshold for major lock rehabilitation projects. It also suggests making all cost overruns for IWTF construction projects a 100% federal responsibility, which critics argue could be an additional hidden cost to the federal government. The IWUB proposes shifting the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects to 68% federal and 32% non-federal, with all cost overruns becoming a 100% federal responsibility. Critics argue this change would increase hidden costs for the federal government. The IWUB proposes shifting construction project cost-share to 68% federal, 32% non-federal, with concerns raised about increased federal costs for inland waterways. The Obama Administration's proposals aim to change user fees for inland waterways, but the cost-share between federal and nonfederal expenditures would remain at 50/50. Some argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction. The Obama Administration's proposals aim to change user fees for inland waterways, with some arguing for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction and maintenance. Congress may consider these proposals in the context of government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement in Corps IWTF planning processes and improve project prioritization. Industry users believe these reforms will reduce cost overruns, which have been a problem in the past. Previous studies by the Corps identified factors contributing to cost overruns, including inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. The IWUB has also requested Congress to consider funding changes that would cover construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance costs currently funded by the general treasury revenues. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement in Corps IWTF planning processes and improve project prioritization. This could decrease cost overruns, which have been a problem in the past due to inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. Congressional attention may focus on the Corps' method for prioritizing inland waterway projects, as decisions are currently made without a formal set of criteria. The IWUB report proposes reforms to improve project prioritization for IWTF investments. Currently, decisions are made without formal criteria, but the IWUB recommends adopting a priority ranking system to be regulated. This could change Congress's role in project selection and funding. If a system for prioritizing investments is regulated as recommended in the IWUB report, Congress's role in project selection and funding could be limited to providing authorizations and overall funding levels, changing its previous role in directing Corps projects."
