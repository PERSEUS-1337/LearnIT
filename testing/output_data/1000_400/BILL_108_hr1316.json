    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Approximately 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the highest number in women aged 21-40. In the United States, about 300 new cases of PPH are diagnosed each year, with the highest number in women aged 21-40. PPH can affect people of all ages and ethnicities equally, making it difficult to study due to its low prevalence. In about 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial. (4) Learning more about PPH is challenging due to its low prevalence and the lack of a good animal model for studies.\n(5) Approximately 6 to 10 percent of PPH cases are familial.\n(6) In advanced stages, PPH patients can only perform minimal activity and may become completely bedridden.\n(7) PPH is often diagnosed late as it mimics other heart and lung conditions, making it a diagnosis of exclusion.\n(8) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry in 1981. (9) PPH is a diagnosis of exclusion, often confused with other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry in 1981, providing valuable insights into the disease. Research is focusing on immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of PPH. (10) Between January 1996 and December 1997, nearly 6,000,000 Americans used anorexic drugs, which can lead to PPH. Many individuals now suffer from PPH, with some in terminal stages or having already passed away. It is expected that more cases of PPH caused by diet drugs will be identified in the future. (11) Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is when the cause is known, with common causes being related to breathing issues. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is caused by known factors such as breathing disorders like emphysema and bronchitis, inflammatory diseases like scleroderma, and congenital heart defects. Other causes include chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The text chunk discusses the expansion, intensification, and coordination of activities of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute regarding research on pulmonary hypertension. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is tasked with expanding, intensifying, and coordinating research activities on pulmonary hypertension. This includes collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies within the National Institutes of Health. Grants and contracts will be provided to public or nonprofit private entities for this purpose. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is responsible for funding centers of excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension. These centers will conduct research, training programs, and provide information and education on the disease. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute funds centers of excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension. These centers conduct basic and clinical research, training programs, and provide information to health professionals and the public. Stipends may be provided for scientists and health professionals enrolled in training programs.

These centers conduct research, training programs, and provide information to health professionals and the public. Stipends may be provided for scientists and health professionals in training programs. The Director coordinates information among centers and ensures regular communication between them. Each center uses the facilities of a single institution. The Director coordinates communication between centers, prepares reports on activities, and ensures organization of centers using single institutions or consortiums. At least three centers are established for up to 5 years, with possible extensions for additional 5-year periods based on operations.

The Director of the Institute shall establish a data system for the collection, storage, analysis, retrieval, and dissemination of data derived from patient populations with pulmonary hypertension. The Director of the Institute will establish a data system for collecting, storing, analyzing, and sharing data on pulmonary hypertension patients. Additionally, an information clearinghouse will be set up to enhance understanding of the condition among health professionals, patients, industry, and the public. Public input will be solicited for these efforts. The Director of the Institute aims to enhance knowledge of pulmonary hypertension through effective dissemination of information. Public input will be sought for existing and planned programs, and biennial reports on activities will be prepared. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these efforts. The Director of the Institute will prepare biennial reports on activities conducted and supported under this section, to be included in the Director's overall biennial reports. Up to $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008 for these purposes."
