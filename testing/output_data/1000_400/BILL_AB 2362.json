    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways to a dwelling unit or common area without a licensed pest control operator. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required when pesticides are applied by a licensed pest control operator.Adjacent separate interests are defined as those directly beside, above, or below a particular separate interest or common area. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"adjacent separate interest\" and \"licensed pest control operator.\" In common interest developments, a \"licensed pest control operator\" is defined as someone licensed by the state to apply pesticides. A \"pest\" is a living organism that causes damage or transmits diseases, while a \"pesticide\" is any substance used to control pests, excluding certain types defined by federal law. (7) \u201cPesticide\u201d is a substance used to control pests, excluding certain types defined by federal law. An association or its agent must provide written notice to affected owners and tenants when applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator, including information on the pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. State law requires providing information on the pest to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. CAUTION \u2013 PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. Proper use conditions can minimize risks associated with certain pesticides. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a healthcare provider or the California Poison Control System. For more information, contact the County Health Department or the Department of Pesticide Regulation. Prior to pesticide application, the association must provide notice to owners and tenants at least 48 hours in advance. The notification should include the approximate date, time, and frequency of the pesticide application, with a disclaimer that these details are subject to change. Prior to pesticide application, the association must provide notice to owners and tenants at least 48 hours in advance. For individual separate interests, notice must be given to the owner and tenant, and for common areas, a written notice should be posted or individual notice provided to adjacent separate interests. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants can be provided through mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery if an address is provided. Owners or tenants can agree in writing to immediate pesticide application upon receipt of notification. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner of the separate interest or tenant may agree to immediate pesticide application. The association or authorized agent can apply a pesticide immediately or at an agreed-upon time. If the owner or tenant requests, the association can agree orally to an immediate pesticide application before the 48-hour notice period. Prior to receiving written notification, the association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. The written notice must be left in a visible place before the pesticide application. The association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. A written notice must be provided to all relevant parties before the pesticide application, and a copy of this notice should be attached to the minutes of the board meeting following the application."
