Bayesian analysis is also explored, with a focus on penalizing sharp minima and determining optimal batch size. Additionally, the connection between PAC-Bayes bound and Bayesian marginal likelihood is discussed in the context of negative log-likelihood loss. The text discusses using the Hessian of the loss function to evaluate model simplicity and penalize sharp minima. It connects the PAC-Bayes bound with Bayesian marginal likelihood for negative log-likelihood loss, providing an alternative view on Occam's razor. Various studies have used the PAC-Bayes bound to analyze generalization in deep models, showing that flat minima produce simpler classification boundaries compared to sharp minima. The text explores incorporating local properties of solutions into generalization analysis using the PAC-Bayes perspective. It discusses using the difference between perturbed loss and empirical loss as a sharpness metric and optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound for better model generalization. The relationship between model generalization and local smoothness of a solution is a key question addressed in the paper. The paper investigates the relationship between model generalization and the local smoothness of a solution from a PAC-Bayes perspective. It establishes that the generalization error is linked to the Hessian, Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, parameter scales, and training sample size. A new metric for generalization is introduced, allowing for the selection of an optimal perturbation level to enhance generalization. An algorithm leveraging Hessian estimation is proposed to improve model generalization in supervised learning within the PAC-Bayes framework. The paper introduces a new metric for generalization and proposes an algorithm using Hessian estimation to improve model generalization in supervised learning within the PAC-Bayes framework. The paper discusses the PAC-Bayes framework for minimizing expected loss by considering posterior and prior distributions over function classes. It suggests a bound related to KL divergence between the distributions, with optimization possibilities for achieving a bound with high probability over sample draws. The PAC-Bayes framework considers minimizing expected loss by analyzing posterior and prior distributions over function classes. A perturbation bound is discussed, connecting generalization with local properties around the solution w through perturbations. Optimization for achieving a bound with high probability over sample draws is also mentioned. In this section, the local smoothness assumption is introduced along with the main theorem. The focus is on connecting the Hessian matrix with model generalization rigorously, particularly in a small local neighborhood around a reference point. Global smoothness properties for deep models are deemed unrealistic, leading to the definition of local smoothness assumptions. The paper introduces the local smoothness assumption and main theorem for connecting the Hessian matrix with model generalization in a small local neighborhood around a reference point. The focus is on defining the neighborhood set and Hessian Lipschitz condition for controlling the deviation of the optimal solution. The paper discusses the Hessian Lipschitz condition for controlling the deviation of the optimal solution in numeric optimization. The focus is on assuming convexity and \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz for the loss function, with a theorem stating the expected loss under uniform perturbation levels. Theorem 2 states that with carefully chosen perturbation levels, the expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model can be controlled. The bound is related to the diagonal element of Hessian, Lipschitz constant \u03c1 of the Hessian, neighborhood scales characterized by \u03ba, number of parameters m, and number of samples n. Perturbation level is inversely related to \u2207 2 i,iL, suggesting perturbing more along \"flat\" coordinates. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is also discussed in the appendix. The perturbation level is inversely related to \u2207 2 i,iL, suggesting perturbing more along \"flat\" coordinates. The perturbation of the function around a fixed point can be bounded by terms up to the third-order, with zero expectation for perturbations. The bound holds with probability at least. The third-order perturbations with zero expectation can be simplified due to independence. The \"posterior\" distribution of model parameters is uniform, with varying support. Assuming bounded perturbed parameters, the KL divergence is log(\u03c4/\u03c3). The third-order term is bounded. The over-parameterization phenomenon is not explained by the bound. The third-order term in the model is bounded, but the over-parameterization phenomenon is not explained by this bound. The loss function and model weights are constrained, and with certain probabilities, perturbed random variables are considered. The experiment treats a parameter as a hyper-parameter, and a weighted grid can be built for further analysis. The weights are bounded with certain constraints. In experiments, a parameter is treated as a hyper-parameter, and a weighted grid can be built for further analysis. The spectrum of \u2207 2L is not enough to determine generalization power in a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation function. Re-parameterization of the model can scale the Hessian spectrum without affecting model prediction and generalization. When using a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation, re-parameterizing the model can scale the Hessian spectrum without impacting model prediction or generalization. The bound on perturbation levels scales inversely with parameter scaling, changing approximately with a logarithmic factor. The optimal perturbation levels in the bound are logarithmic functions, indicating that for RELU-MLP, the bound changes at a logarithmic speed. The optimal perturbation levels in the bound scale inversely with parameter scaling, changing approximately with a logarithmic factor. Re-parameterization in RELU-MLP models results in small changes to the bound. An approximate generalization metric, pacGen, is introduced based on PAC-Bayes theory. The approximate generalization metric, pacGen, is introduced based on PAC-Bayes theory. It involves calculating the metric on real-world data by estimating the diagonal elements of the Hessian and the Lipschitz constant. To estimate efficiency, the Hessian of a randomly perturbed model is used, along with a neighborhood radius \u03ba. The Hessian diagonal elements and Lipschitz constant are estimated for efficiency using Adam. The neighborhood radius \u03ba is set to 0.1, and experiments vary batch size with fixed learning rate. Test loss vs. training loss gap and metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) trends are observed. No LR annealing heuristics are used for large batch training. In Figure 2, the trend of increasing gap between test loss and training loss as batch size grows is observed. The proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) shows a similar trend. Experimenting with fixed batch size and varying learning rate shows that as the learning rate decreases, the gap between test loss and training loss increases. Similar trends are seen in CIFAR-10 experiments. Adding noise to the model for better generalization has been successful. The proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) shows a similar trend to the increasing gap between test loss and training loss as batch size grows. Adding noise to the model for better generalization has been successful both empirically and theoretically. Instead of only minimizing the empirical loss, optimizing the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] is suggested for better model generalization power. A systematic way to perturb the model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound is introduced, using exponential smoothing technique to estimate the Hessian \u2207. The algorithm details are presented in Algorithm 1, treating \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter. The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, using exponential smoothing to estimate the Hessian \u2207. Parameters with small gradients below \u03b2 2 are perturbed, with perturbation level decreasing logarithmically as epochs increase. The algorithm aims to optimize the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] for better model generalization power. In Algorithm 1, parameters with small gradients below \u03b2 2 are perturbed using a per-parameter \u03c1 i capturing Hessian variation. Perturbation level decreases logarithmically with epochs. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 are compared using Wide-ResNet BID36 model. Different optimization methods and parameters are used for each dataset. The model is 58 with a widen-factor of 3, dropout layers are off. Adam is used for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with a learning rate of 10^-4 and batch size of 128. Perturbation parameters include \u03b7 = 0.01, \u03b3 = 10. For Tiny ImageNet, SGD is used with a learning rate of 10^-2 and batch size of 200. Perturbed SGD parameters include \u03b7 = 100, \u03b3 = 1. Different optimizers and learning rates are used for each dataset. The study compares the use of different optimizers and learning rates for CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Perturbation is observed to have a regularization effect, improving accuracy on the validation set. PerturbedOPT outperforms dropout by applying varying levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures. The study shows that PerturbedOPT performs better than dropout by applying different levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures. The generalization power of a model is linked to the Hessian, smoothness of the solution, parameter scales, and training sample size. The best perturbation level scales inversely with the square root of the Hessian, integrating it into the model generalization bound for the first time. The curr_chunk discusses integrating the Hessian into the model generalization bound for the first time, proposing a new metric and perturbation algorithm based on the Hessian. It also demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in improving performance on unseen data using a toy example with a 2-dimensional sample set from a mixture of 3 Gaussians. The curr_chunk details a toy example using a 2-dimensional sample set from a mixture of 3 Gaussians. A 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss is used, with shared weights and no bias terms. The model has only two free parameters, w1 and w2, and is trained using 100 samples. The loss function is plotted with respect to the model variables w1 and w2. The model in the toy example has shared weights and uses a 2-by-2 linear coefficient matrix with only two free parameters, w1 and w2. The loss function is plotted with respect to these variables, showing multiple local optima. The colors on the loss surface represent the generalization metric scores, with a smaller score indicating better generalization power. The figure displays a sharp local optimum marked by a green line and a flat local optimum marked by a red line, suggesting potential poor generalization capability around the global optimum. The generalization metric scores (pacGen) are compared between the global optimum and local optimum in the figure. The color on the bottom plane represents an approximated generalization bound. The sharp minimum approximates the true label better than the flat minimum. The red bar has a slightly higher loss but a similar overall bound to the \"sharp\" global optimum. The sharp minimum approximates the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels, while the flat minimum produces a simpler classification boundary. Truncating the Gaussian distribution is necessary due to bounded perturbation requirements. The event DISPLAYFORM1 is analyzed using the union bound P(E) \u2265 1/2. The coefficients are bounded and the prior \u03c0 is chosen as N. After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the event DISPLAYFORM1 is analyzed using the union bound P(E) \u2265 1/2. Coefficients are bounded and the prior \u03c0 is chosen as N(0, \u03c4 I). The bound is approximated with \u03b7 = 39 using inequality (8). The variance decreases after truncation, leading to a smaller bound for the truncated Gaussian. When L(w) is convex around w*, the best \u03c3i is solved for, resulting in Lemma 4 for bounded model weights. After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the best \u03c3i is solved for when L(w) is convex around w*. Lemma 4 states that for bounded model weights, with probability at least 1 - \u03b4 over n samples, the inequality is rewritten to minimize the right-hand side. The term \u03b7 is treated as a hyper-parameter in the algorithm. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter. The proof involves rewriting inequalities and solving for \u03c3 to minimize certain terms. The proof also shows that \u03b7 cannot depend on the data and requires optimization through a grid search. Additionally, there is a lemma regarding eigenvalues of the Hessian and generalization. The proof involves optimizing \u03b7 through a grid search and a lemma on eigenvalues of the Hessian and generalization. Another lemma discusses correlated perturbations in the loss function. Lemma 5 states that for a loss function l(f, x, y) \u2208 [0, 1], with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over n samples, a local optimal point w * satisfies the local \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition. The proof shows that even with correlated perturbations, the inequality still holds. The section discusses comparing dropout and a proposed perturbation algorithm in deep models.

Accuracy versus epochs for training and validation is shown in figures for each dataset. Results are presented using wide resnet architectures with dropout turned on or off, reporting accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. For Tiny ImageNet, SGD with learning rate 10 \u22122 and batch size 200 is used. Perturbed SGD is implemented with specific parameters. Validation set is used as the test set for Tiny ImageNet. Dropout improves validation/test accuracy compared to the original method. Different dropout rates work best for each dataset, with perturbed algorithm showing better performance on validation/test data sets. In experiments with wide resnet architectures, dropout 0.1 works better for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet due to the need for more regularization with fewer training samples in CIFAR-10. The perturbed algorithm outperforms dropout methods on validation/test data sets, possibly by applying varying levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures."
