Amounts appropriated under this Act may remain available until expended. SEC. 4. Trademark filing fee set at $245, with adjustments not effective before October 1, 1994. SEC. 5.

Section 156 of title 35, United States Code is amended to allow for interim patent extensions if the regulatory review period extends beyond the patent expiration date. The owner or agent can apply for an extension 6 months before the term expires. The owner or agent can apply for an interim extension of a patent under Section 156 of title 35, United States Code if the regulatory review period extends beyond the patent expiration date. The application must include details about the product subject to review, the patent being sought for extension, and activities undertaken. The applicant must provide information to the Commissioner for determining patent extension eligibility during regulatory review, including product details, activities undertaken, and necessary patent information. If the patent is deemed eligible for extension, the Commissioner will publish a notice in the Federal Register. The Commissioner will grant an interim extension of a patent for up to 1 year if it is eligible, with the option for the owner to apply for up to 4 subsequent extensions. The applicant must provide necessary information for extension eligibility during regulatory review. The owner of a patent can apply for up to 4 subsequent interim extensions, except for patents under a specific subsection where only 1 extension is allowed. Each extension application must be submitted 60-30 days before the previous extension expires and will be recorded as part of the original patent. The extension ends 60 days after the product receives commercial permission, unless the applicant notifies the Commissioner within that period. Any interim extension granted under this paragraph shall terminate at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the product involved receives permission for commercial marketing or use. If the applicant notifies the Commissioner within that 60-day period and submits additional information, the patent may be further extended for up to 5 years from the original patent term expiration date. During an interim extension, patent rights are limited to the specific use or method of manufacturing that is under regulatory review. The extension lasts for up to 5 years from the original patent term expiration date or until the product receives approval for commercial marketing. SEC. 6 of title 35, United States Code is amended to make changes in subsections (a), (b), and (e) regarding patent rights. SEC. 7 introduces patent term extensions for American Legion. SEC. 7 introduces patent term extensions for the badges of the American Legion, American Legion Women's Auxiliary, and Sons of the American Legion, renewing and extending their design patents for 14 years. SEC. 8 states that renewals and extensions of patents will not infringe on any patent for use that began after the patent expired but before the enactment of the Act."
