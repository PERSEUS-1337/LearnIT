FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Recent revelations have led to proposals to amend FISA and the FISC's practices, focusing on the selection process for FISA court judges. This report focuses on proposals to alter the process for selecting judges for the FISA courts, ensuring their independence and impartiality. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be reduced, to maintain a fair administration of the laws. The FISC, established by Congress under FISA, is an Article III court. The FISC, established by Congress under FISA, is an Article III court authorized to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations. It may approve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, or access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials, with federal judges designated by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), can approve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, or access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials, with federal judges designated by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some argue against the sole authority of the Chief Justice in selecting judges for these courts. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process of selecting judges for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the FISA Court of Review. Critics argue against the sole authority of the Chief Justice in selecting judges, proposing bills that would transfer selection authority to the chief judges of the circuit courts or authorize the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice and consent. The selection method for FISA judges is being debated in the 113th Congress. Proposals include transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President or congressional leadership to choose FISA judges. The main concern is the constitutionality of designating judges by a specific branch of government. The judicial branch has expressed concern with proposals to shift selection away from the Chief Justice. This report reviews the constitutional method for appointing judges and the process of \"designation\" for temporary service. The judicial branch expressed concern with proposals to shift selection of FISA judges away from the Chief Justice in January 2014. The report reviews the constitutional method for appointing Article III judges and explores the constitutionality of proposals that shift designation authority to other officials within the branches of government. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment of certain government officials. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment of government officials, including principal officers like judges. The Supreme Court has ruled that expanding duties may not require a second appointment for an incumbent judge. The Supreme Court has ruled that expanding duties may not require a second appointment for an incumbent judge if the additional duties are germane to the official's original government post. This principle was established in cases like Weiss v. United States and Shoemaker v. United States. The Supreme Court has ruled that an existing federal judge can be designated to serve in a separate position without a second appointment, as long as the duties are related to their original post. Congress has historically used designations for Article III courts and given the Chief Justice authority to temporarily assign federal judges to other courts. The Supreme Court has addressed the constitutionality of the designation process within the judicial branch, noting that Congress has long used designations for Article III courts. The Chief Justice has the authority to temporarily assign federal judges to serve on other federal courts, including specialized tribunals. The creation of the now-defunct Commerce Court was one of the earliest instances where the Chief Justice was vested with authority to designate federal judges to a special tribunal. This Chief Justice-based designation process became a model for future specialized courts. The Commerce Court, established with judges appointed by the President and subsequent judges designated by the Chief Justice, served as a model for specialized courts. The Supreme Court has upheld the designation process, allowing for temporary assignment of federal judges to other courts. The Supreme Court has upheld the designation process for temporary assignment of federal judges to other courts, dismissing constitutional challenges in cases like McDowell v. United States and Lamar v. United States. The Supreme Court has upheld the designation process for temporary assignment of federal judges to other courts, dismissing constitutional challenges in cases like McDowell v. United States and Lamar v. United States. The Court in Lamar v. United States also rejected a constitutional challenge to the Chief Justice's authority to designate district court judges, stating that the argument was unsound. Similarly, courts have upheld the constitutionality of the process for designating FISA judges, with the Ninth Circuit rejecting an argument that it violated the Appointments Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that the FISC violates the Appointments Clause because judges are designated by the Chief Justice rather than appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. The court cited precedent for the temporary assignment of lower federal judges by the Chief Justice to serve on specialized courts, including FISA judges. The central issue raised by proposals to alter who selects FISA judges is whether. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes to maintain designation authority within the judicial branch, dispersing the selection process for the FISC between the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. This would increase the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would be directed to designate the district court judge proposed by the Act. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes to disperse the selection process for the FISC between the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. The number of FISC judges would increase from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would have the authority to designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit from which a vacancy arises. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes to disperse the selection process for the FISC between the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice would have the final authority to designate a judge to the FISA courts, with at least five associate justices of the Supreme Court concurring in the designation for the FISA Court of Review. Limited judicial precedent suggests that such an arrangement could be constitutionally valid. The McDowell Court suggested that Congress has the authority to designate judges to serve on FISA courts, based on the power to establish courts and absence of territorial restrictions on District Judges. This implies that Congress can empower chief judges to appoint judges within their circuits to serve on FISA courts. The McDowell Court suggested that Congress has the authority to designate judges to serve on FISA courts, based on the power to establish courts and absence of territorial restrictions on District Judges. This implies that Congress can empower chief judges to appoint judges within their circuits to serve on FISA courts. However, proposals exist to shift the authority to designate FISA court judges to the President, such as the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761). Some proposals suggest giving the President authority to designate FISA court judges, like the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761). This could raise questions about the FISA courts' status as Article III courts due to the difference in appointment terms. A proposal suggests allowing the President to designate FISA court judges, potentially impacting their status as Article III courts. The difference in appointment terms could raise questions about the judges' overall position on the federal judiciary. The proposal to allow the President to select FISA court judges may raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it could be seen as executive encroachment on the judiciary. However, past rulings have shown that the President can appoint judges to certain judicial bodies without violating the separation of powers. The Court in Mistretta v. United States ruled that the President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission without undermining judicial independence. The President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties. If a federal judge is removed from the FISA courts, they would still serve as an Article III judge on their original court. The President's power to appoint judges to the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns if his ability to remove them could compromise their impartiality. There are proposals to give designation authority to congressional leadership. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove judges could influence their impartiality. Proposals suggest giving designation authority to congressional leadership, potentially conflicting with the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. The proposals to give congressional leadership authority to designate appointees with significant authority may raise concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles, as outlined in I.N.S. v. Chadha. The bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution must be satisfied when altering legal rights outside the Legislative Branch. Congressional designation to the judiciary by one house's leadership without approval from the other or the President could raise concerns based on principles established in Chadha."
