Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that truck crashes are more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, large truck-related crashes caused 5,212 deaths and 114,000 injuries in the US.

These crashes also have a significant economic cost, with highway crashes costing society $230.6 billion annually. The Department of Transportation estimates that highway crashes cost society $230.6 billion annually. Investments in advanced safety systems by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to reduce the traffic fatality rate. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce the traffic fatality rate through the deployment of advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles. Congress recognizes the importance of increasing the use of these technologies to mitigate the societal costs of crashes.
