    "content": "The integration of a Knowledge Base (KB) into a neural dialogue agent is a key challenge in Conversational AI. Memory networks are effective in encoding KB information to generate fluent responses. However, memory can become full of latent representations during training, leading to the need to overwrite old entries randomly. Memory dropout is introduced as a technique to encourage diversity in latent space by aging redundant memories and sampling new memories. This approach improves dialogue generation in the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset, achieving a +2.2 BLEU points increase in response generation and an 8.1% increase in named entity recognition. The use of memory dropout technique improves dialogue generation in the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset, resulting in a +2.2 BLEU points increase in response generation and an 8.1% increase in named entity recognition. Dialogue systems need to infer automatic responses grounded in personal knowledge bases to integrate semantic information for dialogue understanding. Leveraging contextual information from a knowledge base, such as a calendar of events, can help answer specific queries effectively. Existing neural dialogue agents struggle to interface with structured data in knowledge bases, posing a challenge in providing accurate responses. Memory dropout is proposed as a technique to regularize latent representations stored in external memory for neural dialogue agents. This method aims to reduce overfitting and improve the ability to generate fluent and informed responses by encoding knowledge base information effectively. Unlike conventional dropout techniques, memory dropout offers a different functionality to enhance dialogue systems' performance. Memory dropout is a new regularization method designed for neural dialogue agents to reduce overfitting and improve response generation by encoding knowledge base information effectively. Unlike conventional dropout techniques, memory dropout delays regularization by increasing the probability of overwriting redundant memories with more recent representations during training. Our work introduces memory dropout as a regularization method for Memory Augmented Neural Networks, aimed at reducing overfitting. It is designed to incorporate knowledge base information effectively in neural dialogue agents, leading to more fluent and accurate responses. The technique of memory dropout is used to improve response generation in neural dialogue agents by incorporating knowledge base information. Results show a significant improvement in response quality compared to not using it, with an increase in BLUE points and Entity F1 score. The model aims to increase diversity in latent representations stored in external memory by aging positive keys and allowing them to be overwritten by other training examples. The memory dropout neural model aims to increase diversity in latent representations stored in external memory by aging positive keys, allowing them to be overwritten by other training examples. It incorporates normalized latent representations in long-term memory and uses arrays K and V to store keys and values, respectively. The memory network includes arrays K and V to store keys and values, respectively, with additional arrays A and S for age and variance. The goal is to maximize the margin between positive and negative memories while minimizing positive keys. A differentiable Gaussian Mixture Model is used to parameterize positive memories, generating new positive embeddings. The memory network uses a differentiable Gaussian Mixture Model to maximize the margin between positive and negative memories by parameterizing positive memories with new embeddings. Positive keys are represented as a linear superposition of Gaussian components to provide a rich density model. The memory network utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model to enhance the margin between positive and negative memories. Positive keys are modeled as a linear combination of Gaussian components, allowing for a rich density model that captures the uncertainty of each key. The mixing coefficients in the model quantify the similarity between the input and positive keys, enabling the generation of new keys through sampling from the mixture components. The neural encoder with external memory preserves distinct versions of h during training. Positive memory entries are candidates to answer to the embedding h. Sampling a new key k from a Gaussian distribution involves selecting an index i from mixture components. The external memory incorporates information from the latent vector h to the new key k, resets its age, and computes variance to address uncertainty. Redundant keys are penalized by an aging mechanism. The memory dropout neural model is studied in a dialogue system for automatic responses. The memory dropout neural model is applied in a dialogue system for automatic responses grounded in a Knowledge Base (KB). The goal is to utilize contextual information from the KB to answer queries accurately. Existing neural dialogue agents struggle to interface with structured data in a KB, hindering flexible conversations. The proposed architecture aims to address this challenge. The proposed architecture combines a Sequence-to-Sequence model for dialogue history and a Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) for encoding the Knowledge Base (KB) in a more generalized manner. The KB is decomposed into triplets to express relationships, allowing for more flexible conversations.

It computes unnormalized probabilities for predicting the next token and minimizes cross entropy between actual and generated responses. The model utilizes a Softmax to predict tokens and minimize cross entropy between actual and generated responses. Evaluation is done on the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset, which includes dialogues in the domain of an in-car assistant with personalized KBs. The in-car assistant utilizes a personalized KB for automatic responses. Three types of KBs are used: schedule of events, weekly weather forecast, and point-of-interest navigation. Comparison of Memory Augmented Neural Network with Memory Dropout (MANN+MD) with baseline models on BLEU and Entity F1 scores is presented. An encoder-decoder architecture is used for mapping sequences with minimal assumptions on structure, focusing on dialogue history. Key-Value Retrieval Network+Attention and Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) are compared, with MANN having no memory dropout mechanism. Models are trained with Adam optimizer and dropout, with specific parameters for word embedding and network architecture. The models used in the study include bidirectional LSTMs with 3-layer encoders and decoders, memory network models with 1,000 memory entries, trained with Adam optimizer and dropout. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets. Evaluation of dialogue systems is challenging due to free-form responses, with BLEU metric used for fluency assessment. The study evaluates dialogue systems using BLEU and Entity F1 metrics to measure fluency and entity retrieval. Memory dropout improves dialogue fluency and entity recognition. Not attending to the knowledge base leads to lower Entity F1 scores. The Seq2Seq+Attention model shows the lowest Entity F1 scores. The study compares different memory networks in dialogue systems. Memory dropout improves fluency and entity recognition. The MANN+MD model outperforms others in BLEU and Entity F1 scores. KVRN is the best performing model without memory dropout. Our approach outperforms KVRN in Entity F1 score by +10.4% and slightly improves the BLEU score by +0.2, setting a new state-of-the-art for the dataset. KVRN excels in the Scheduling Entity F1 domain with 62.9%, possibly due to dialogues that do not require a knowledge base. The gains obtained by MANN+MD may be attributed to the explicit penalization of redundant keys during training. The correlation of keys in memory networks is studied in Section 4.4. Keys tend to become redundant as training progresses, with MANN+MD showing low correlation values compared to MANN and KVRN. The memory networks studied in this paper show low correlations initially, with MANN and KVRN storing more redundant keys over time. In contrast, MANN+MD maintains low correlation values and encourages diverse representations in the latent space. Memory dropout helps reduce overfitting by overwriting redundant keys. Testing the advantage of memory dropout, Entity F1 scores for MANN and MANN+MD models are compared with different neighborhood sizes. Traditional dropout for encoder and decoder inputs and outputs is disabled to isolate the contribution of memory. Memory dropout in MANN+MD helps reduce overfitting by encouraging diverse representations in the latent space. Comparing Entity F1 scores between MANN and MANN+MD models during training shows that MANN has higher scores due to increased memory capacity, while MANN+MD performs better during testing, indicating less overfitting and better generalization. During testing, MANN shows lower Entity F1 scores, indicating overfitting to the training dataset. However, using memory dropout (MANN+MD) results in better Entity F1 scores during testing, with an average improvement of 10%. Testing with different neighborhood sizes shows two distinct groups of Entity F1 scores based on the use of memory dropout. Comparing models with external memory of different sizes, it is found that larger memories are needed to accommodate the encoding of knowledge base for better Entity F1 scores during response generation. The use of external memory in models with memory dropout requires larger memories to handle redundant activations. Memory dropout allows for storing diverse keys, enabling higher accuracy with smaller memories. Deep Neural Networks utilize memory networks for classification tasks involving non-linearly separable classes. In this dataset, smaller memories can achieve higher accuracy by utilizing keys. Memory networks with external memory and attention mechanisms address similar content in memory. Few-shot learning is used to remember infrequent patterns, with approaches like Neural Turing Machines extending architecture capacity. In this paper, the key-value architecture introduced by Kaiser et al. (2017) is extended for efficient training with gradient descent and associative recall. Deep models for dialogue agents also incorporate knowledge bases and external memory for encoding content. Our model introduces a memory augmented approach to address overfitting in dialogue agents, requiring smaller memory size compared to existing architectures. Regularization techniques, such as controlling overfitting and generating sparse activations, have been effective in neural networks. Wang & Niepert (2019) proposed state transition regularization in recurrent neural networks. Our memory dropout technique addresses overfitting by regularizing memory networks, proving its effectiveness in tasks like automatic dialogue response. It works at the level of memory entries, unlike traditional dropout techniques, and is the first to do so. Memory Dropout is a regularization technique for memory augmented neural networks that addresses overfitting by regulating memory entries. It differs from traditional dropout by working at the level of memory entries rather than individual activations. This technique proves effective in tasks like automatic dialogue response by considering age and uncertainty to regularize the addressable keys of an external memory module. Memory Dropout is a regularization technique for memory augmented neural networks that regulates memory entries to prevent overfitting. It focuses on age and uncertainty to regularize the addressable keys of an external memory module, leading to improved performance in tasks like training a task-oriented dialogue agent."
