Projects will be developed to mitigate impacts on fisheries caused by water diversions in the Pacific Ocean drainage area. The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program aims to reduce fish mortality and prevent fish from entering water supply systems in the Pacific Ocean drainage area. Projects will be implemented to mitigate impacts from water diversions by local governmental entities, focusing on developing fish screens, fish passage devices, and other related features. Priority will be given to projects costing less than $5,000,000. Non-Federal participation in the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program is voluntary. The Secretary will not hold non-Federal entities financially responsible unless they choose to participate. Projects on U.S. owned land will not require reimbursement. Evaluation and prioritization of projects will focus on those costing less than $5,000,000. Evaluation and prioritization of projects for development under the Program will be based on benefits to native fish species, size and type of water diversion, availability of funding sources, cost effectiveness, and additional opportunities for biological or water delivery system benefits. Eligibility requirements will also be considered. Eligibility requirements for projects under the Program include meeting Secretary and State requirements, agreement by all involved entities, consultation with various agencies, and use of available data.
