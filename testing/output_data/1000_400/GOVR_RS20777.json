    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses, while consumer filings continued to rise until 2005, surpassing 2 million before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The new law caused a sharp drop in filings in 2006, but numbers rose steadily until 2010. Household debt figures are shown in Table 2. The impact of BAPCPA on bankruptcy filings is uncertain. Filings increased steadily from 2006 to 2010, exceeding 1.5 million. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving and non-revolving debt. Mortgage debt is secured by real estate, with home equity lending potentially substituting for consumer credit. Federal Reserve estimates on debt burden are also included in the data. Debt, including auto and college loans, mortgage debt, and home equity lending, is a significant component of household finances. Federal Reserve data shows that the debt burden, as a percentage of household disposable income, has fluctuated within a narrow range over the past decade. Despite a gradual increase in debt burden since the 1980s, it does not fully explain the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings over the same period. The debt burden figures have fluctuated within a narrow range since 2007, with a gradual increase since the 1980s. Despite falling interest rates, the ratio of debt to income has been rising, but this has not led to a significant reduction in bankruptcy rates. The debt burden has remained relatively stable despite historically low interest rates, leading to a rise in the ratio of debt to income. This increase in debt, especially between 1990 and 2007, suggests potential future issues with bankruptcy filings if interest rates were to suddenly rise. Household debt has increased since 1980, but declining interest rates have allowed households to take on more debt without a significant increase in interest payments. Since 1980, declining interest rates have allowed households to increase debt without a significant rise in interest payments. Table 3 shows the percentage of families at various income levels spending over 40% of their income on debt service, revealing distress among lower-income families. The data in Table 3 reveals that lower-income families are most likely to file for bankruptcy, with no clear trend explaining the increase in filings. While distress levels remained stable from 1998 to 2007, there was a notable rise in bankruptcy among higher-income families, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The question remains why families below the national median income take on high debt levels leading to bankruptcy. Vulnerable populations like the sick, uninsured, divorced, or residents of certain states may be particularly affected. The rise in consumer bankruptcy filings may be due to increased mortgage debt taken on during the housing boom. Families at or below the national median income are taking on high levels of debt, leading to bankruptcy. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, while opponents blamed credit card issuers and lenders for financial distress. The lack of a consensus explanation suggests the issue will remain controversial. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession amidst global financial panic, leading to a decline in household debt levels for 11 quarters. Factors contributing to the fall in debt balances included home equity and credit card debt reductions, with mortgage debt accounting for most of the drop. The lack of a consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings indicates ongoing controversy. Debt levels fell in the third quarter of 2011, with home equity and credit card debt leading the decline. Mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms, attributed to factors such as households paying down debt, borrowing less, and lenders writing off uncollectible debt. Tightened credit standards and mortgage modifications also contributed to the decrease in debt balances."
