    "content": "This report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles: The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. These laws address forest management on federal and nonfederal lands, as well as forestry research. The 115th Congress enacted forest management provisions through two laws, including the 2018 farm bill. These laws address forest management on federal and nonfederal lands, as well as forestry research. The focus is on federal forest management provisions that change how the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management manage their lands. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manage vast amounts of land, with FS overseeing 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS) and BLM managing 246 million acres of public lands. The report discusses laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) that authorize forest management activities. The 115th Congress enacted provisions affecting how FS and BLM implement these activities, covering project planning, wildland fire management, forest restoration programs, and more. The report summarizes and analyzes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress that affect how the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) implement activities such as project planning, wildland fire management, and forest restoration programs. It categorizes the provisions into project planning, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous, discussing relevant issues, changes made, and potential congressional concerns. The complexity of the issue, nature of changes, and congressional interest determine the depth of coverage for each provision. The report also includes side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior laws. The report discusses provisions enacted by the 115th Congress affecting Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management activities. It covers project planning, wildland fire management, forest management, and restoration programs. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands, with Congress directing management to protect watersheds, provide timber, and allow for recreation, grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) requires the Forest Service to coordinate resources for multiple uses, including recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish habitat, in addition to watershed protection and timber production. The management approach aims for sustained yield, maintaining resource outputs without impairing land productivity. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) requires the Forest Service to prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System (NFS) unit, involving public participation and compliance with various laws such as NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Forest plans aim to balance multiple resource uses while maintaining sustained yield and high resource outputs without harming land productivity. The Forest Service must comply with cross-cutting laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA when taking actions. Forest plans outline resource conditions but do not authorize specific projects. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, must align with the forest plan's objectives and follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with applicable requirements. The Forest Service must comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA for projects such as timber harvests, trail maintenance, and hazardous fuel reduction. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, with 38 million acres being woodlands and forests, under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, with 38 million acres being woodlands and forests, under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies. BLM manages public lands for permanent forest production, timber, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. Activities must comply with resource management plans and federal laws like NEPA. Compliance with NEPA depends on the proposal's impacts. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before final decisions. Actions with significant impacts need an EIS, while uncertain impacts may require an EA or FONSI. Agencies must evaluate proposed actions and alternatives, including a no-action alternative. Under NEPA, agencies use Environmental Assessments (EAs) to determine if an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is needed or if a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) can be issued. EAs and EISs evaluate the impacts of proposed actions and alternatives, including a no-action alternative. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions that do not have a significant environmental effect and are exempt from EIS or EA requirements. Some CEs are established by Congress in statute. Based on past experience and statutory requirements, federal agencies identify categorical exclusions (CEs) that do not require further documentation. These actions are exempt from Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) or Environmental Assessments (EA) and are approved through a decision memorandum. Each agency lists actions that typically require an EIS or EA resulting in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, federal agencies identify actions that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE. FS and BLM regulations also identify resource conditions termed extraordinary circumstances that may warrant further analysis in an EA or EIS, such as flood plains, endangered species habitat, wilderness areas, and archaeological sites. The presence of resource conditions like flood plains, endangered species habitat, wilderness areas, and archaeological sites may require further analysis in an EA or EIS, termed extraordinary circumstances. These circumstances may preclude the use of a CE for eligible projects. NEPA serves as a framework to identify environmental impacts and requirements for projects, with agency procedures implementing NEPA serving as an umbrella compliance process. The agency's NEPA process identifies project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review requirements under other laws like ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA may be waived for certain actions, but requirements triggered by impacts under other federal laws would still apply. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by modifying biomass availability. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by modifying biomass availability. The authorization covers up to 20 million acres of federal land and defines specific hazardous fuel reduction projects. It also defines terms like At-Risk Community. The HFRA authorization covers up to 20 million acres of federal land for hazardous fuel reduction projects. It defines terms like At-Risk Community and Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects, which include methods like prescribed fire and mechanical methods for reducing hazardous fuels. The property resulted from a wildland fire disturbance event. HFRA Projects involve methods like prescribed fire and mechanical methods to reduce hazardous fuels. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes prioritize and assess fuel reduction projects. WUI is an area near an at-risk community with or without a CWPP. HFRA projects prioritize hazardous fuel reduction in areas like the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), municipal watersheds, and lands at risk of natural disturbances. Projects are excluded from designated wilderness areas or areas prohibiting vegetation removal by law. HFRA projects focus on hazardous fuel reduction in areas like the Wildland-Urban Interface, municipal watersheds, and lands at risk of natural disturbances. Projects are excluded from designated wilderness areas or areas prohibiting vegetation removal by law. HFRA also mandates that projects must be consistent with the land and resource management plan in place for the area. Certain projects must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior while maximizing large or old-growth tree retention. An objection process is established for proposed HFRA projects. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) focuses on hazardous fuel reduction in specific areas and mandates projects to be consistent with the land management plan. It requires thinning, prescribed fire, or tree removal to modify fire behavior while retaining large or old-growth trees. An objection process is established for proposed HFRA projects, allowing objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) mandates projects to reduce hazardous fuels and requires thinning, prescribed fire, or tree removal. An objection process allows parties to raise issues within specific comments during the comment periods. If unsatisfied after administrative review, judicial review in federal court is the next step. FS replaced the post-decisional appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for HFRA projects. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) mandates projects to reduce hazardous fuels through thinning, prescribed fire, or tree removal. Congress directed the Forest Service to replace the post-decisional appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new section to HFRA, allowing for the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the National Forest System. The Agricultural Act of 2014 authorized the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the National Forest System. These areas are designated based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees posing a safety risk. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated for treatment. The Forest Service has designated 74.5 million acres nationwide for landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas to address declining forest health and tree mortality risks. Projects within these areas must prioritize reducing insect or disease infestations, involve collaboration with government entities and interested parties, consider scientific evidence, and aim to preserve old-growth and large trees. The Forest Service has designated 74.5 million acres nationwide for landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas. Projects within these areas must prioritize reducing infestations, involve collaboration with government entities and interested parties, consider scientific evidence, and aim to preserve old-growth and large trees. Projects planned within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative, while projects outside the WUI must also consider the no-action alternative. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System (NFS) areas for designation as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas and prioritize projects in those designated areas. The Forest Service has designated 74.5 million acres nationwide for landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas. Projects within these areas prioritize reducing infestations, involve collaboration, consider scientific evidence, and aim to preserve old-growth and large trees. For projects within 1.5 miles of an at-risk community, only analysis of the proposed action is required. Projects outside the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) must consider the no-action alternative. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System (NFS) areas for designation as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas and prioritize projects in those designated areas. As of March 2019, 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under these authorities, with various evaluation procedures being used. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states under authorities to reduce insect and disease infestations. Projects are evaluated using different analysis procedures, with some being processed using a categorical exclusion. The 2014 farm bill added a new section to prioritize hazardous fuels projects for implementation through the categorical exclusion. The 2018 Farm Bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority category eligible for implementation through a categorical exclusion (CE). Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or consider best available science, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. These projects are exempt from pre-decisional administrative review objections. The 2018 Farm Bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority category eligible for implementation through a categorical exclusion (CE). Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within designated I&D areas or in areas classified as Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Group I, II, or III. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed, but no new permanent roads can be established. The 2018 Farm Bill expanded FS and BLM planning requirements, allowing hazardous fuels projects within designated areas or in specific fire regime groups. Projects must not exceed 3,000 acres and can include fuel breaks and fire breaks. Decision-making is done through a Farm Bill CE process. The 2018 Farm Bill expanded FS and BLM planning requirements to include hazardous fuels projects within designated areas or specific fire regime groups. Projects can include fuel breaks and fire breaks, with decision-making done through a Farm Bill CE process. The FY2018 omnibus amended HFRA to allow for the installation of fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the use of procedures to expedite priority projects in I&D areas, including projects to reduce hazardous fuels. The 2018 Farm Bill reauthorized procedures under HFRA to expedite priority projects in I&D areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects. It also established new statutory CEs to streamline planning and implementation processes. Additionally, changes were made to interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The 2018 Farm Bill and the FY2018 omnibus bill established new statutory CEs to expedite specific projects, with provisions affecting interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The omnibus bill created a CE for wildfire resilience projects for FS, while the Farm Bill CE focused on greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat projects for both FS and BLM. The potential impact of these new CEs on project planning, implementation, and forest management goals is uncertain. The new statutory CEs established by the 2018 Farm Bill and FY2018 omnibus bill allow for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned and implemented more efficiently by FS and BLM. Using a CE for environmental review can expedite project implementation, as shown by a 2014 GAO report that found FS took 177 days to complete CEs compared to 565 days for EAs in FY2012. Some argue that using a CE for environmental review can expedite project implementation, as shown by a 2014 GAO report that found FS took 177 days to complete CEs compared to 565 days for EAs in FY2012. However, concerns exist about conducting large-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews, which may lead to undesirable resource effects. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in Section 605 of HFRA, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and is for hazardous fuel reduction projects in designated I&D areas on NFS lands. FS policy requires a decision memo to use the Farm Bill CE, ensuring no significant environmental effects are present. Eligible projects must meet CFLRP requirements or prioritize old-growth retention. The decision to use the Farm Bill CE for projects must be documented through a decision memo, after assessing for extraordinary circumstances that could have a significant environmental impact. Eligible projects must comply with CFLRP requirements or prioritize old-growth retention. Projects are limited to 3,000 acres, cannot establish new permanent roads, and must decommission temporary roads within three years. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed. Projects under the Farm Bill CE must adhere to specific requirements, including a limit of 3,000 acres, no new permanent roads, and decommissioning of temporary roads within three years. Priority is given to projects in WUI areas, but projects outside may be considered if in high wildfire hazard potential areas. The Secretary must submit an annual report on CE use to congressional committees and GAO. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 under this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE, like the Farm Bill CE, requires projects to be located within designated areas and adhere to specific fire regime conditions. However, the Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects within the WUI and areas with high wildfire hazard potential. The Secretary must report annually on CE use to congressional committees and GAO, with seven projects proposed in FY2018. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in the WUI and areas with high wildfire hazard potential, while the Farm Bill CE is more versatile, addressing insect and disease infestation as well. Congress directed FS to evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present for the Wildfire Resilience CE projects, potentially requiring further analysis. The Farm Bill CE directs FS to assess if extraordinary circumstances are present that may preclude its use, specifically for sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat projects. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill outlines requirements for applying the CE to protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem for these species. The Farm Bill CE directs FS and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat within one year. Projects must be consistent with the resource management plan and comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336. Specific activities include removing nonnative vegetation and targeted herbicide use. Projects may not occur in designated wilderness areas. The Farm Bill CE directs FS and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat within one year. Projects must comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336, which outlines specific activities like removing nonnative vegetation and targeted herbicide use. Projects are restricted from occurring in designated wilderness areas and must adhere to size limitations, road restrictions, and decommissioning requirements. The Farm Bill CE mandates projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat within specific guidelines. Projects must comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336, adhere to size limitations, road restrictions, and decommissioning requirements. The CE requires projects to be completed within three years or when no longer needed, limited to 4,500 acres, and only allowed in designated I&D areas on NFS lands. Agencies must consider landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and habitat restoration, with a 20-year monitoring plan required before use. The CE differs from other CEs in project purposes and requirements. The Farm Bill CE mandates projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat within specific guidelines, including compliance with DOI Secretarial Order 3336, size limitations, road restrictions, and decommissioning requirements. Projects must be completed within three years or when no longer needed, limited to 4,500 acres, and only allowed in designated I&D areas on NFS lands. Agencies must develop a 20-year monitoring plan before using the CE. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve endangered or threatened species and their ecosystems, administered by FWS and NMFS. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened, with prohibitions applying once listed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) administered by FWS and NMFS lists plants and animals as endangered or threatened, with prohibitions applying. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or their habitat. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure that actions, such as obtaining federal approval, permit, or funding, do not harm endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat. This consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, is required for discretionary actions but not for actions dictated by statute. If the appropriate Secretary determines that an action will not jeopardize a species or its critical habitat, a biological opinion (BiOp) is issued with terms and conditions for the action to proceed without harm to the species. The Secretary issues a biological opinion (BiOp) specifying terms and conditions for federal actions to avoid harm to species. Consultations mostly result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives. FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. It specifies that listing a species as threatened or endangered does not require consultation to update a forest plan unless it is older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since listing. This does not affect consultation requirements for projects implementing forest plans. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. It states that consultation to update a forest plan is not needed if it is older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since listing a species as threatened or endangered. This controversial change overrides a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision regarding re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat designation for the Canada lynx. The enacted changes override a Ninth Circuit Court decision, allowing for flexibility in implementing land management plans without requiring Section 7 consultations for existing plans after a species listing or critical habitat designation. Proponents argue this will maintain plan consistency and reduce delays, while opponents fear it could harm species if plans with harmful activities are not re-consulted. The changes in land management plans allow for flexibility without requiring consultations for existing plans after species listing or critical habitat designation. Critics argue that not allowing re-consultation could harm species if plans include harmful activities. Proponents believe projects are still required to undergo consultation, making plan consultation redundant. However, critics argue that plans address projects at a higher level and could impact the cumulative effect of all activities. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities, primarily handled by FS and DOI, include various activities such as fuel reduction, prevention, detection, and suppression. Recent legislative changes in funding allocation, wildfire risk mapping requirements, and reporting have impacted these programs. Additionally, laws have modified aspects of hazardous fuel reduction programs within FS and DOI. The federal government has made recent legislative changes in funding allocation for wildfire suppression, added requirements for wildfire risk mapping, and implemented specific reporting requirements. These changes also affected hazardous fuel reduction programs within FS and DOI. Funding for wildland fire management is provided through discretionary appropriations in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for wildland fire management is provided through discretionary appropriations in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Congress allocates funding to the Office of Wildland Fire within DOI, which then distributes it to BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for wildfire control. FS and DOI have Suppression Operations programs within their Wildland Fire Management accounts to fund firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and post-wildfire response programs. If their suppression funding runs out, they are authorized to transfer funds. The program funds wildfire control on federal land, including firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and post-wildfire response. If suppression funding is depleted, funds can be transferred from other accounts (fire borrowing). Appropriations for wildland fire management have increased since the 1990s, mainly due to rising suppression costs. FS and DOI often require more funds than allocated, leading to fire borrowing and concerns about increasing suppression costs. Since the 1990s, appropriations for wildland fire management have increased due to rising suppression costs. The FS and DOI often require more funds than allocated, leading to fire borrowing and concerns about the impact on other agency programs. Congress has enacted supplemental appropriations to address the discrepancy in funding, with wildfire spending subject to procedural and budgetary controls. The 115th Congress explored providing wildfire spending outside of these constraints in the FY2018 omnibus. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budgetary controls in the FY2018 omnibus, known as the wildfire funding fix. Discretionary spending is currently limited by the Budget Control Act of 2011, with sequestration enforced for exceeding limits. Spending is subject to statutory limits for fiscal years FY2012 to FY2021. Enacted discretionary spending cannot exceed these limits, enforced through sequestration. Certain spending is exempt from limits, including emergency and disaster-relief funding. A new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations was added in FY2018 omnibus, starting in FY2020. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020. This adjustment applies to emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, and emergency stabilization activities, as well as other emergency management activities. It includes funds necessary to repay any transfers needed for these costs and applies to appropriations above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020. This adjustment applies to emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, and emergency stabilization activities, as well as other emergency management activities. It includes funds necessary to repay any transfers needed for these costs. The adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Any funding above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015 would be considered outside the discretionary spending limits established in the BCA. The adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations starts at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increases to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress can appropriate additional funds for wildfire suppression above the FY2015 baseline without being subject to discretionary spending limits. For example, in FY2020, Congress could appropriate up to $3.64 billion for suppression operations. The BCA discretionary limits allow for up to $3.64 billion to be appropriated in FY2020 for wildfire suppression, outside of the discretionary limits. This funding adjustment potentially removes budget process barriers for additional wildfire suppression funds in FY2020 and FY2021. The wildfire funding fix removes budget process barriers for additional wildfire suppression funds in FY2020 and FY2021. The BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect until FY2021, with the wildfire adjustment potentially applicable until FY2027 if new limits are established. It is uncertain if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority once the wildfire adjustment takes effect in FY2020. The wildfire funding fix in effect starting in FY2020 allows agencies to request supplemental appropriations if funds for wildfire suppression operations are estimated to be exhausted within 30 days. This raises concerns for Congress, as agencies like FS did not report their 10-year suppression obligation for FY2020. The wildfire funding fix starting in FY2020 allows agencies to request additional funds for suppression operations if needed. Concerns for Congress include lack of accountability in reporting suppression obligations, absence of inflation adjustments in funding baselines, and the fix not addressing various concerns like cost forecasting and effectiveness of suppression methods. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 is a temporary procedural change for Congress to fund suppression operations. It does not address concerns like improving cost forecasting, evaluating suppression methods, or addressing drivers of increasing suppression costs. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to help with strategic planning and fuel management decisions nationally. Approximately 226 million acres in the US are classified as high risk for wildfires. The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index assesses the potential for difficult-to-contain wildfires using various data. Approximately 226 million acres in the US are classified as high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land and the rest state, tribal, other public, or private lands. High or very high WHP indicates fuels with a higher likelihood of extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions. This data, when combined with spatial data, can estimate relative wildfire risk to resources and assets. The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index assesses the potential for difficult-to-contain wildfires using various data. Around 226 million acres in the US have high or very high WHP, with 53% federal land and the rest state, tribal, other public, or private lands. The WHP data, when paired with spatial data, can estimate relative wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs FS to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use. Both the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require reports on wildland fire management. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use. Reports on wildland fire management must be submitted to Congress, with specific requirements outlined in the omnibus. The first report may be due by December 30, 2021, if the wildfire funding fix is utilized in FY2020. The omnibus establishes requirements for reports on wildland fire management, to be prepared by the Secretaries in consultation with the OMB Director. The report must document the use of wildfire funding fix, overall spending, and factors influencing suppression decisions. It should also include lessons learned and an analysis of a statistically significant sample. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildland fire management spending, including factors influencing suppression decisions and lessons learned. It also requires a report on wildfire prevention on federal land to be submitted to Congress. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildfire prevention on federal land to be submitted to Congress. The report must include information on the number of acres treated for wildfire prevention, areas categorized as high fire risk, and the impact of wildfires on treated and untreated land. The agencies are required to report on the number of acres of federal land treated for wildfire prevention, areas categorized as high fire risk, impact of wildfires on treated and untreated land, federal response time for large fires, timber production, maintenance needs for roads and trails, backlog for recreational facilities, measures to maintain water quality, and measures to improve ecosystem function on federal land. Forest restoration activities aim to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbance. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to establish or reestablish ecological processes for resilience and resistance to disturbance events, such as insect infestations or wildfires. This may involve thinning trees to reduce density or using prescribed fire to manage vegetation buildup and post-fire recovery. Forest restoration on federal land involves activities such as thinning trees and using prescribed fire to reduce tree density and manage vegetation buildup. The authority for conducting these projects comes from laws such as FLPMA for BLM and various acts for FS, aimed at protecting and managing national forests for multiple uses and sustained yield. The 115th Congress established new forest restoration programs for FS and BLM, including watershed condition framework and water source protection. Existing programs like CFLRP, stewardship contracting authority, and good neighbor authority were also amended to allow partnerships with stakeholders for identifying and managing forest restoration needs. The 115th Congress established new forest restoration programs for FS and BLM, including watershed condition framework and water source protection. Additionally, existing programs like CFLRP, stewardship contracting authority, and good neighbor authority were amended to allow partnerships with stakeholders for identifying and managing forest restoration needs. These programs aim to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate insect and disease infestations and reduce the risk of wildfires, while also providing benefits to surrounding communities. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, aiming to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate insect and disease infestations and reduce wildfire risks. Proponents highlight benefits such as supporting local industries, creating new markets for restoration by-products, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders. Some concerns have been raised about specific aspects of the program. The CFLRP, established by the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes. The collaboration process must be inclusive and transparent, involving diverse stakeholders. Priority landscapes must be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands in need of restoration, accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. Proposals must incorporate the best available science and aim to maintain or restore old-growth stands. The CFLRP funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, primarily consisting of NFS lands in need of restoration. Proposals must incorporate the best available science, aim to maintain or restore old-growth stands, and reduce hazardous fuels. No new permanent roads can be established, and any temporary roads must be decommissioned. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with discretion based on funding availability. Annual accomplishments and 5-year status reports are required by law. The law requires annual accomplishments and 5-year status reports for restoration proposals funded by the CFLRP. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with discretion based on funding availability. FS has funded 23 proposals since FY2010, each with individual projects to achieve forest restoration goals. A fund covers up to 50% of project costs, with up to $40 million in annual appropriations available through FY2019. Selected proposals can receive up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years for project implementation. The CFLRP established a fund to cover 50% of project costs, with up to $40 million in annual appropriations available through FY2019. Each selected proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for project implementation for up to 10 years. The program is seen as successful, contributing to land management objectives and local economies. The dedicated funding commitment provides stability and predictability for project coordination. The CFLRP program has dedicated funding for project implementation, contributing to land management objectives and local economies. However, some feel it falls short in fostering new markets for wood products and resolving complex issues with community stakeholders. The CFLRP program, reauthorized by the 2018 farm bill, has funding of up to $80 million annually through FY2023. It allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years. The law also requires status reports to be sent to the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture. Funding for 23 selected proposals is set to expire at the end of FY2019, prompting the need for reauthorization. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with funding of up to $80 million annually through FY2023. It allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years. The law also added the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture as recipients of the five-year program status reports. The funding commitment for the 23 selected proposals is set to expire at the end of FY2019, so the reauthorization and extension of eligibility could result in some projects continuing beyond that initial time-frame. If Congress chooses to appropriate to the new authorization level, it could also result in more projects being selected and funded. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments. The program was initially authorized as a temporary pilot on NFS land in Colorado in 2001, before the permanent authorization made it available nationwide for all NFS lands as well as BLM lands. Under an approved GNA, states are authorized to... The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating insect- and disease-infested trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and other activities to improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health. Activities like fish and wildlife improvement projects, timber removal, and tree planting are included, with treatments prohibited in designated wilderness areas. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including activities like fish and wildlife improvement projects, timber removal, and tree planting. Treatments are prohibited in designated wilderness areas, and the law does not include construction or restoration of permanent roads. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws, including NEPA, and approving silvicultural prescriptions. MAs between states and FS or BLM outline the general scope of the GNA, with SPAs detailing specific project terms. FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering 82 national forests with a focus on timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The good neighbor authority allows for collaboration between state governments and federal agencies for forest restoration work on national forests. It focuses on specific project types such as timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The authority has been successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and leveraging state resources, but concerns exist about the sustainability of future work. Recent legislative changes have expanded the scope of activities allowed under the authority. The resource capacity varied among states participating in the good neighbor authority. Some states expressed concerns about the uncertainty of future GNA work. Legislative changes in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded the scope of GNA activities to include road construction, restoration, and decommissioning on NFS roads. The farm bill also extended GNA availability to federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments, allowing states to retain funds from timber sales for additional GNA projects until FY2023. Payments made by counties under a GNA project are not subject to any restrictions. The farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include tribes and county governments, allowing states to retain funds from timber sales for additional GNA projects until FY2023. Payments made by counties under a GNA project are not subject to any restrictions. This expansion may increase cross-boundary restoration work and leverage nonfederal resources, but could also lead to increased administrative demands on FS or BLM. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) was expanded by the farm bill to include tribes and county governments, allowing states to retain funds from timber sales for additional GNA projects until FY2023. This expansion may increase cross-boundary restoration work and leverage nonfederal resources, but could also lead to increased administrative demands on FS or BLM for contract administration, project planning, and oversight. Some concerns include the distribution of receipts from timber sales and revenue-sharing with county governments. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a pilot program in 1999 and made permanent in the 2014 farm bill, allowing FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts to achieve land management goals. The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1999 authorized FS and BLM to enter into multi-year dual service and timber sale contracts to achieve land management goals. This authority was made permanent by the 2014 farm bill, allowing the agencies to combine timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs and achieve objectives like water quality restoration through road and trail maintenance. The agencies can combine timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs and achieve land management goals such as water quality restoration, forest health improvement, and wildlife habitat restoration. Excess timber sale revenue can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other stewardship projects without further appropriation. Contracts can be awarded on a best-value basis, considering past performance. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to deposit excess timber sale revenue into a fund for other projects without additional appropriation. Contracts can be awarded based on best value, considering past performance and other factors. Annual reports are required on the progress of stewardship contracts, which are generally well-received for their benefits in achieving restoration goals and fostering collaborative relationships. Stewardship contracting is viewed favorably by stakeholders, with increased opportunities for restoration goals and economic benefits. Concerns include the removal of ecologically important trees for service work and issues with revenue distribution. Some concerns regarding stewardship contracting include the potential incentive to remove valuable trees for service work, issues with revenue distribution, upfront financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. Initial difficulties in implementation were attributed to integrating different contract types and poor record-keeping, but improvements have been made over time. The agencies initially faced challenges integrating various contract types and maintaining reliable record-keeping. Despite these obstacles, improvements were made over time, with more contracts offered annually covering larger areas. However, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. FS responded by issuing new guidance in 2016. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts or agreements. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in areas classified in Fire Regime Groups I, II, and III. The law also allowed a procurement preference for innovative forest product use and included a cancellation ceiling in contracts. Excess revenues can be used to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. The law authorized FS and BLM to include a cancellation ceiling in stewardship contracts, allowing funds to be obligated in stages. Excess revenues can be used to pay for liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for contracts with a cancellation ceiling over $25 million without proposed funding. The cancellation ceiling provision in stewardship contracts allows funds to be obligated in stages, resolving concerns about up-front financial obligations. The use of 20-year contracts and procurement preference may increase market certainty for forest products industries. OMB identified inadequacies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report. The NFS has authorized watershed protection as a key goal, but OMB found deficiencies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 report. Concerns included lack of water quality data, inconsistent national approach, and inadequate performance measures. To address this, FS committed to developing long-term performance measures, improving water quality data, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. As part of this effort, FS created a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to assess watershed conditions. The FS committed to developing outcome-based performance measures for watershed management on NFS lands. They created the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to classify watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds, and develop restoration action plans. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report found inadequacies in FS' management of the WCF program, including inadequate coordination and oversight at the national level. The 2017 USDA OIG report identified deficiencies in FS' management of the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program, including inadequate coordination and oversight at the national level. The 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities for watershed restoration on NFS land. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program, allowing the Forest Service to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, prioritize protection and restoration activities, and implement restoration action plans for up to five priority watersheds in each national forest. Additionally, an emergency designation process is authorized for rehabilitating watersheds impacted by wildfires. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework program to evaluate and prioritize protection and restoration activities for priority watersheds. It also allows for emergency designation to rehabilitate watersheds impacted by wildfires. Water source protection is an authorized activity on National Forest Service lands, with the Secretary of Agriculture able to enter into cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement. The Secretary of Agriculture can enter cooperative agreements for watershed restoration with various entities. Federal funds may be used if in the public interest. The 2018 farm bill authorized a Water Source Protection program on NFS land for water source investment partnerships. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land. This allows FS to partner with nonfederal entities to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as municipal water sources. FS can develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners, conducting forest management activities to protect water supplies and restore forest health. FS can conduct a single environmental analysis for each project proposed under the plan and accept various forms of investment. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to partner with nonfederal entities to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as municipal water sources. FS can develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners, conducting forest management activities to protect water supplies and restore forest health. FS can accept cash, donations, services, and other forms of investment from partners to implement the plan, with a Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations. Congress authorized $10 million in annual appropriations to the Fund through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill established a Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations for protecting and restoring NFS watersheds. Congress authorized $10 million in annual appropriations to the Fund through FY2023. Other provisions in the bill included designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and various provisions related to land acquisition, exchange, and forest management on tribal lands. Section 8626 of the bill designated one new wilderness area and expanded five existing areas in NFS lands Tennessee. The 2018 farm bill designated one new wilderness area and expanded five existing areas in NFS lands Tennessee, including the Upper Bald River Wilderness on the Cherokee National Forest. These areas are managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas in NFS lands Tennessee, including Upper Bald River Wilderness. The areas are managed according to the Wilderness Act, prohibiting commercial activities and motorized access. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted provisions changing how FS and/or BLM acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land, establishing new programs and authorities. For example, the 2018 farm bill Section 8623 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to lease isolated parcels for administrative sites, while the FY2018 omnibus reauthorizes a program to sell or exchange BLM lands for administrative purposes. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites and selling or exchanging BLM lands for administrative purposes. It also modified existing programs and authorized conveyance of undeveloped parcels of NFS land. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites and selling or exchanging BLM lands for administrative purposes. It also modified existing programs and authorized conveyance of undeveloped parcels of NFS land, expanding eligibility requirements. Additionally, the bill contained provisions for issuing rights-of-way for the use and occupancy of BLM and NFS lands. The Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands, allowing various purposes like water infrastructure, electricity generation, communication systems, and transportation facilities. Cost-recovery is charged by FS and BLM for these authorizations. The BLM and FS charge cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications for rights-of-way on public lands. Fees are based on estimated hours for processing and monitoring, with separate schedules for linear ROWs and communication uses. The BLM and FS charge cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications for rights-of-way on public lands, based on estimated hours. The 115th Congress enacted provisions directing FS to update their process and fee schedule for special use authorizations for communication sites and established a pilot process for activities within utility ROWs. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity and utility rights-of-way (ROWs) to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some believe that complex administrative processes hinder necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risks on federal lands within ROWs. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity and utility rights-of-way (ROWs) to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some believe that confusing administrative processes hinder necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risks on federal lands within ROWs. Others argue about the responsibility of permit holders in vegetation management projects. The provisions aim to improve the approval process for ROW permit holders, but concerns remain about balancing project implementation speed with accountability and adherence to federal land laws. Some provisions also specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within ROWs. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within electricity and utility rights-of-way (ROWs) on federal lands. Concerns exist about the breadth of these provisions and the potential implications for cost-sharing. Others believe that limiting damages and liability will encourage prompt agency action on maintenance requests from ROW permit holders. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process to issue special use authorizations for communications uses on NFS lands within one year of enactment, defined relevant terms, and identified specific requirements for the process. The provisions aim to address concerns about cost-sharing for wildfire suppression costs within electricity and utility rights-of-way on federal lands. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands. The process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized, with lease terms of at least 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a Treasury account for managing communication sites. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands, with lease terms of at least 15 years. The regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a Treasury account for managing communication sites. Additionally, Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to include Vegetation Management, Facility Inspection, and Operation and Maintenance on Federal Land Containing Electric Transmission and Distribution Facilities. Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish a new section titled Vegetation Management, Facility Inspection, and Operation and Maintenance on Federal Land Containing Electric Transmission and Distribution Facilities. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs, specifying requirements for owners to develop and submit plans for approval. The law directs FS and BLM to review, approve, and modify plans for vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities submitted by ROW permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their ROW with an approved plan. Certain management activities can be conducted without approval in specific circumstances. FS and BLM must identify NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities and propose regulations within one year of enactment. Training programs for FS are encouraged. The law directs FS and BLM to review, approve, and modify plans for vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities submitted by ROW permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their ROW with an approved plan. FS and BLM are directed to identify NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities and propose regulations within one year of enactment. Training programs for FS are encouraged. The law also specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities, including limitations on strict liability for damages or injury. The law establishes liability limitations for activities in the ROW, with a cap of $500,000 for damages resulting from activities conducted by a ROW holder. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of the liability clauses to Congress within four years. A pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land was established through FY2023, with specific requirements outlined. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans and conduct projects within their ROWs. Participants must adhere to FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. Participants are responsible for project costs, with the possibility of FS contributing funds. The pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land allows participants to develop vegetation management plans and conduct projects within their ROWs. Participants must follow FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. They are responsible for project costs, with the potential for FS to provide funds. The law requires FS to report program status to Congress biennially. Participants may also pay for and perform projects on specified NFS lands within 75 feet from the ROW, with the Secretary of Agriculture having discretion to contribute funds. If a participant provides funds to FS, the Secretary may retain them for the pilot program, subject to appropriations. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage to FS resources if the wildfire is caused by their operations, under certain conditions. The pilot program on NFS land requires participants to submit a program status report to Congress biennially. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire costs if caused by their operations, with a limit of $500,000 in certain cases. The FY2018 omnibus program for electricity ROWs differs from the NFS pilot program. The FS must reimburse pilot participants for excess costs, limited to $500,000 in certain cases. The electricity ROW provisions in the FY2018 omnibus differ from the NFS pilot program. The 2018 farm bill pilot program includes electricity, natural gas, and infrastructure, with limits on participant responsibilities. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on prior year revenue. SRS offers optional payment system to these counties as an alternative to revenue-sharing. The FY2018 omnibus addresses wildfire and vegetation management, caps liability costs for program participants, and provides payments to counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands based on prior year revenue. SRS offers optional payment system to these counties as an alternative to revenue-sharing, with payments allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, projects on the lands, and specified county programs. Title I FS payments were for education and roads, Title II payments for projects on lands, and Title III payments for county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) were established to provide advice and recommendations to agencies with specific membership requirements. The law established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) with specific membership requirements and minimum membership of 15 members representing various interests. SRS payments were authorized at 95% of the previous year's level, with the last payment disbursed in FY2016. Counties receive lower revenue-sharing payments when SRS payments are not authorized. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018, setting the FY2017 payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment. Counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017, with payments made in FY2018. The reauthorization of SRS payments for FY2017 set the payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment and accounted for payments already disbursed. Counties received full payments in two installments, with changes to payment allocation and expanded uses for Title III funds. The reauthorization expired after FY2018 payments were distributed in FY2019. The 2018 farm bill also made changes to the SRS statute, establishing a process for modifying RAC membership. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute, allowing for modifications to RAC membership requirements and establishing a pilot program for appointing RAC members in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands, as well as NFS and BLM lands adjacent to tribal lands. The TFPA requires evaluation of tribe requests based on unique tribal features and factors, while the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) authorizes tribes to enter self-determination contracts with the federal government. The TFPA allows agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands, as well as NFS and BLM lands adjacent to tribal lands. The ISDEAA authorizes tribes to enter self-determination contracts with the federal government, including performing administrative functions of the TFPA on a demonstration basis. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with tribes for forest management functions on NFS land. Congress may oversee implementation and assess implications for federal forest management and restoration. Congress may consider oversight of forestry provisions enacted by the 115th Congress, including implementation of new laws and addressing concerns with federal forest management. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres at high risk in need of restoration, with a backlog that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. Hazardous fuels are accumulating faster than treatment rates, highlighting the need for action. The Forest Service aims to treat 2-6 million acres annually to address a backlog that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. Hazardous fuels are accumulating three times faster than treatment rates, prompting a proposal to increase forest management projects. Administrative barriers, including decision-making processes and challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act, hinder progress in implementing projects at the necessary pace and scale. Some stakeholders point to agency decision-making processes, specifically related to the National Environmental Policy Act, as a barrier to implementing forest health projects efficiently. Other challenges include inadequate funding and training, hindering the agency's ability to meet project planning requirements. The 115th Congress has enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies in project implementation. The 115th Congress has enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies in project implementation by expanding procedures to expedite planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. Some stakeholders believe that utilizing Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions would speed up project implementation and help agencies achieve restoration goals. However, concerns have been raised about changes to agency decision-making processes and the legal framework. Expanding the use of NEPA Categorical Exclusions and Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities could expedite project implementation for forest restoration goals. However, concerns exist about changes to agency decision-making processes and potential environmental impacts. The National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended investing in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems to address forest health concerns and mitigate wildfire risk. Recommendations were made in the 1990s to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop a strategy for long-term fuel reduction. Concerns were raised about the Forest Service's hazardous fuels reduction program in 2006. A 1995 study recommended increasing hazardous fuel treatments to 3 million acres per year by 2005. In 1999, GAO suggested developing a strategy for long-term fuel reduction. In 2006, OIG raised concerns about FS' hazardous fuels reduction program and recommended guidance for project prioritization and monitoring. A 2016 OIG report found ongoing issues with prioritizing and tracking fuel reduction projects. Congress also evaluated challenges impeding FS' fuel management projects in 2001. The 2006 report highlighted issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about project implementation have persisted, with a significant percentage of decisions being appealed. Academic studies suggest that complex projects are more likely to face challenges. The HFRA, passed in 2003, aimed to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects on NFS areas. Despite these efforts, the need for treatment has increased, prompting the FS to seek ways to accelerate project implementation. Some view this as a sign that the HFRA approach has not been successful, while others believe it should be more widely applied. The NFS areas in need of treatment have increased despite efforts to expedite projects. Some believe the HFRA approach has not been successful, while others suggest it should be more widely applied. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill compare forest-related provisions enacted by each law to prior legislation."
