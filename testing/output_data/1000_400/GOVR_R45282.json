    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for regulatory activities. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954 to partially cover costs, with additional annual appropriations funding the majority of expenses. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established the current pesticide fee framework, modifying provisions from 1988. It authorized the collection of maintenance fees for EPA review of pesticide registrations issued before November 1, 1984, and registration service fees for new pesticide active ingredients. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) authorized the collection of maintenance fees and registration service fees for EPA review of pesticide registrations. PRIA 2 in 2007 reauthorized and amended the pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) authorized EPA to collect fees for review activities and set specific timeframes for application reviews. PRIA 2 in 2007 added new fee categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 further amended the fee framework, which was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The current pesticide fee framework is outlined in the following sections. The pesticide fee framework, amended by PRIA 3 and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held. EPA can cancel registrations if maintenance fees are not paid, with fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for certain public health registrations. The EPA can collect up to $27.8 million annually in maintenance fees from FY2013 through FY2018. Registrants must pay fees or risk cancellation of pesticide registration. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from fees. Collected fees go to the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA expenses related to evaluating ingredients, processing applications, and reevaluating pesticides. EPA is required to use up to $800,000 per year to enhance information. The EPA can collect up to $27.8 million annually in maintenance fees from FY2013 through FY2018 for evaluating ingredients, processing applications, and reevaluating pesticides. EPA is required to use up to $800,000 per year to enhance information systems capabilities. EPA's authority to collect registration service fees begins to phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 and expiration of fee collection authority by the end of FY2019. The EPA's authority to collect registration service fees is set to phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 and expiration of fee collection authority by the end of FY2019. FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, establishes registration service fee amounts for various applicant actions, with specified timeframes for completion. Section 33 of FIFRA establishes fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for certain pesticide registration applications. EPA may waive fees for minor uses, tolerance setting in the public interest, and government entities. The authority to collect fees must be provided by annual appropriations. EPA is prohibited from assessing fees if appropriations for specified functions are insufficient. The authority to collect and obligate registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33 must be provided by annual appropriations. EPA is prohibited from assessing fees if appropriations for specified functions are insufficient. EPA is required to deposit collected pesticide registration service fees in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. For FY2013 through FY2018, EPA is authorized to collect pesticide registration service fees and deposit them in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. The expenditure of these fees is subject to annual appropriations acts and can be used for various purposes, including covering application review costs, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and regulatory activities. EPA is authorized to collect pesticide registration service fees for various purposes, including application review costs, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and regulatory activities. The Inspector General must audit the funds annually, and EPA must report on pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA. The Inspector General audits the Registration Fund in accordance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. FIFRA requires EPA to report annually on pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018. The exact amount for the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs is not readily reported. Maintenance fees collected from FY2004 to FY2018 ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million. EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. From FY2004 to FY2018, maintenance fees ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million per year, while registration service fees ranged from $10.6 million to $18.6 million per year. These fees provide one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. Congress extended the authority to collect fees for one year through FY2018 appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Maintenance fees and registration service fees provide one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. Congress initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize the collection of fees in 2017, with the House and Senate passing separate versions of reauthorization legislation. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1029, renamed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018, reauthorizing the collection of maintenance and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025. The amendment increases the cap on annual maintenance fees per registrant by 12% and directs EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to pesticide efficacy. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 reauthorizes the collection of maintenance and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025. It increases the cap on annual maintenance fees per registrant by 12% and directs EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to pesticide efficacy. EPA is required to carry out two final rules before October 1, 2021, with one exception.

EPA is required to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, related to agricultural worker protection standards and certified pesticide applicators. EPA may propose revisions to address application exclusion zones in the worker protection standard. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 authorizes EPA to propose revisions to worker protection standards, including application exclusion zones. It also directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to report on designated representatives' impact on pesticide application information and worker safety by October 1, 2021. The report must examine the effect of designated representatives on pesticide application and worker health and safety, including recommendations to prevent misuse. H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, would enact House-passed H.R. 1029 into law, while the Senate amendment does not include a similar provision. The House requested a conference with the Senate to resolve differences between the versions. The House requested a conference with the Senate on July 18, 2018, to resolve differences between their versions of H.R. 2. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were enacted without roll call votes, indicating consensus. Disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of FIFRA regulations have stalled the current PRIA reauthorization."
