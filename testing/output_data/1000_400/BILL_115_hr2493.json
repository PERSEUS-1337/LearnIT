    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Conflicts from Political Fundraising Act of 2017\". Congress finds that public confidence in the Federal Government relies on officers and employees avoiding conflicts of interest. The risk arises when nominees or appointees have ties to political entities. This concern has increased since the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010. Since the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision, corporate political spending has significantly increased, with contributions to entities under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code remaining undisclosed. This anonymity poses a risk of conflicts of interest, whether spending is public or anonymous. Financial disclosure requirements currently do not mandate reporting of donations to such entities. Current financial disclosure requirements do not mandate reporting of funds donated to political action committees or entities organized under section 501(c)(4) or section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. Conflicts of interest can be addressed through public disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics for negotiation in ethics agreements. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
