The Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003 highlights the importance of regulating medical imaging and radiation therapy to protect public health. Over 300 million imaging exams and treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that personnel have proper education and credentials. The importance of regulating medical imaging and radiation therapy is emphasized in the Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003 to protect public health and safety. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring personnel have proper education and credentials. Competence in performing medical imaging and radiation therapy should be demonstrated through education, training, and experience. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy must ensure personnel demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience. The responsibility for public health and safety in these procedures lies with both State and Federal Governments, as patients often travel across state lines for these services. These facilities also impact interstate commerce. In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, setting federal standards for accreditation of education programs for medical imaging and radiation therapy personnel. This law also provided a model for state licensing of these professionals, recognizing the interstate nature of these services and the market for technicians, physicians, and supplies. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, some states do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy personnel, while others license, regulate, or register radiographers, radiation therapists, and nuclear medicine technologists. The Act aims to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure for individuals involved in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Licensing varies among states for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, and medical physicists, with no regulation for medical dosimetrists. The goal is to guarantee safety and accuracy in medical imaging. The Act aims to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure for individuals involved in medical imaging and radiation therapy to guarantee safety and accuracy in medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy treatments. SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary before performing imaging or therapy. The Secretary will ensure individuals meet requirements before performing medical imaging or radiation therapy, including passing a national examination approved by the Secretary. Private nonprofit organizations or State agencies can be certified as approved bodies for accreditation of educational programs or examinations. The Secretary establishes standards for certifying nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations. Organizations must meet these standards and provide required assurances to be certified. The Secretary sets standards for certifying nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations. Organizations must comply with these standards, provide assurances, and notify the Secretary of any changes. The Secretary has the authority to withdraw certification if necessary.

The Secretary can withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards. Accreditation or examination completion remains valid for a reasonable period. Existing State standards are deemed compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. The Secretary evaluates approved bodies periodically and includes the results in reports to relevant committees. Regulations for service delivery and payment must be established within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary must establish regulations for service delivery and payment for medical imaging and radiation therapy programs within 18 months of enactment. Alternative standards for rural areas may be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may establish alternative standards for rural areas regarding payment for medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure access to quality care. Regulations must be promulgated within 18 months of enactment to implement this section. The Secretary will establish alternative standards for rural areas for medical imaging and radiation therapy. Regulations must be implemented within 18 months to define terms like 'approved body' and 'medical imaging'. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of medical imaging and the act of performing medical imaging or radiation therapy on patients. It includes procedures like diagnostic X-rays, nuclear medicine, and magnetic resonance procedures. The act of performing involves exposing patients to radiation or a magnetic field for imaging or therapy purposes and positioning them for the exposure. The curr_chunk defines medical imaging and radiation therapy as exposing patients to radiation or a magnetic field for imaging or therapy purposes and positioning them for the exposure. It also explains that planning for these procedures involves evaluating site-specific information to customize the procedure for the patient. The curr_chunk explains that radiation therapy involves customizing procedures for patients based on radiation dose distribution, computer analysis, or direct measurement of dose."
