    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are a significant part of U.S. defense capabilities and spending. Current modernization efforts focus on three main aircraft acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Program-specific issues for Congress in FY2010 include decisions on the F-35 alternate engine program and the F-22 procurement termination. In FY2010, Congress faces decisions on the F-35 alternate engine program, F-22 procurement termination, and Navy's funding request for F/A-18E/F procurement. Multiyear procurement for F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs is also under consideration. In FY2010, Congress is considering funding for F/A-18E/F procurement and the possibility of a multiyear procurement arrangement. Legislative activity on F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs is also being discussed, focusing on the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force and the future of the U.S. industrial base for tactical aircraft design and manufacturing. In FY2010, legislative activity focuses on the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force and the future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft. Tactical aircraft refer to shorter-ranged combat aircraft that can operate within a single regional theater of operations. Tactical aircraft, also known as theater aircraft, operate within a single regional theater of operations. In contrast, strategic aircraft like B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are designed for longer-range missions, including intercontinental flights. The term tactical aircraft primarily refers to fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, with fighters designed for air-to-air combat. In practice, tactical aircraft such as fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes are designed for specific combat roles. Fighters are for air-to-air combat, strike fighters have dual air-to-ground and air-to-air capabilities, and attack planes are primarily for air-to-ground operations. The term tactical aircraft is often shortened to tac air and operates from land bases. Tactical aircraft, including fighters and attack planes, are designed for specific combat roles such as air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. They operate from land bases and aircraft carriers, with some being VSTOL or STOVL aircraft. Fighters focus on air-to-air combat for air superiority, while attack planes specialize in air-to-ground operations. Some Marine Corps tactical aircraft, including VSTOL or STOVL aircraft, are used for various missions such as air-to-air combat, air-to-ground combat, close air support, battlefield air interdiction, and deep interdiction. They can also be utilized for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. The Air Force operates new F-22 fighters along with older aircraft like F-15 fighters and F-15E strike fighters. The Air Force and Navy operate various tactical aircraft for air-to-air and air-to-ground operations, including surveillance and reconnaissance. The inventory includes F-22, F-15, F-16, A-10 for the Air Force, and F/A-18A-D, F/A-18E/F for the Navy. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. In early 2009, the DOD had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft. The Marine Corps operates older F/A-18 A-D strike fighters and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. In early 2009, the DOD had about 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force having around 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, Air Force F-22 fighter program, and Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. The F-35 is a new fifth-generation strike fighter being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is the largest weapon procurement program for the DOD, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The program aims to provide a cost-effective fifth-generation strike fighter for all three services, avoiding the need for separate tactical aircraft designs. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-Ds and AV-8Bs, and the Navy is getting the F-35C for carrier operations. The F-35 program aims to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The Air Force is replacing F-16s and A-10s with the F-35A, the Marine Corps is replacing F/A-18A-Ds and AV-8Bs with the F-35B, and the Navy is using the F-35C for carrier operations. The F-22 fighter, known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The administration wants to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, but supporters aim for 243 to 250 or more. The F/A-18E/F, also known as the Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter that is larger, more modern, and more capable than earlier models. The proposed FY2010 budget did not request funding for additional F-22 procurement. Supporters aim for 243 to 250 or more F-22s. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter, considered a fourth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall peaking at more than 100 aircraft by 2018. The Navy and Air Force have projected significant fighter aircraft shortfalls, with the Navy-Marine Corps facing a peak shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The Air Force's projection of an 800-aircraft shortfall by 2024 has been questioned, citing influences from military threats and organizational constraints. The peak size of the Navy-Marine Corps shortfall depends on assumptions about aircraft service life extensions and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a plan to retire older tactical aircraft to generate savings for other program needs, following the submission of the FY2010 defense budget. This plan does not include the retirement of five fighters proposed in the budget. The Air Force's FY2010 budget proposal includes retiring 250 legacy fighters to fund a smaller, more capable force and prioritize higher missions. This plan excludes the five fighters previously scheduled for retirement. The Air Force's FY2010 budget proposal includes retiring 250 legacy fighters to fund a smaller, more capable force and prioritize higher missions. This plan excludes the five fighters previously scheduled for retirement. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley stated that by accepting short-term risk, they can convert legacy fighters and F-22s into a more flexible and lethal bridge to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years would be used to reduce capability gaps and invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters and bombers. Some funds would also go towards procuring munitions for joint warfighters.

Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years would be used to reduce capability gaps and invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters and bombers, as well as procuring munitions for joint warfighters. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the importance of modernizing the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. The Air Force is restructuring its Combat Air Forces to prioritize emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This move comes after a careful assessment of the current threat environment and the need to modernize the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. Approximately 4,000 manpower authorizations will be reassigned to support these priority missions. The CAF restructuring plan will move 4,000 manpower authorizations to missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a B-52 squadron, and enhancing combat support capabilities. The Air Force aims to field 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11 to meet current mission requirements. The Air Force is committed to initiatives to reinvigorate its nuclear enterprise and field 50 unmanned combat air patrols for ongoing operations by FY11. Secretary Donley emphasized the importance of a force mix that meets current mission requirements while preparing for future challenges. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft, with some predicting a budget \"train wreck\" due to insufficient funding. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a long-standing concern in Congress and elsewhere. Observers predict a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not be sufficient for tactical aircraft acquisition. The issue was previously focused on the affordability of the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but now it may shift to the affordability of the F-35 program as production of other aircraft winds down. DOD plans to increase F-35 procurement to 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a long-standing concern. DOD aims to increase F-35 procurement to 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015, including 80 F-35As for the Air Force and 50 F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps and Navy. Reductions in planned aircraft acquisitions have been made since the early 1990s, mainly due to post-Cold War reductions in Air Force and Navy air wings. The Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan has also contributed to reducing the number of new aircraft to be acquired. The reduction in planned aircraft acquisitions since the early 1990s was mainly due to post-Cold War reductions in Air Force and Navy air wings. Additional reductions were achieved through the Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan, which integrated Navy and Marine Corps strike fighter inventories. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft by acquiring a strike fighter that can be used by all three services. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan remains uncertain, especially considering future defense budgets. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft through the acquisition of a strike fighter that can be procured in three common versions for the three services. However, the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan is uncertain, especially in the context of potential future defense budget constraints. The projected Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps fighter shortfalls highlight the ongoing challenge of funding tactical aircraft modernization. If DOD's plans cannot be fully funded without reducing funding for other programs, policymakers may face difficult decisions. The fighter shortfall may indicate challenges in affording tactical aircraft modernization. Policymakers may need to choose between funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs or non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. They may also need to decide between funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs or other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters for air-to-ground missions. Funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs may need to be balanced against funding for other aircraft systems like long-range bombers or helicopters. Some argue for less emphasis on tactical aircraft in favor of long-range aircraft due to improving anti-access capabilities of potential adversaries. The funding emphasis on tactical aircraft acquisition programs is being compared to funding for other aircraft systems like long-range bombers, helicopters, electronic attack aircraft, surveillance aircraft, and UAVs. Affordability concerns are raised regarding DOD's plans for procuring new aircraft of all types, including unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) that play a role in ground-attack operations. DOD plans to prioritize funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for irregular warfare operations. This includes increasing emphasis on UAVs and UCAVs for ground-attack operations, particularly for precision attacks on terrorist targets. The funding comparison is between land-based Air Force tactical aircraft acquisition programs (F-22 and F-35A) and sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft acquisition programs (F/A-18E/F and F-35 Bs and Cs). The administration's proposal to prioritize funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for irregular warfare operations, including ground-attack missions. There is a debate on funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft (F-22 and F-35A) versus sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft (F/A-18E/F and F-35 Bs and Cs), with discussions on capabilities and costs. The proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A for future Air Force tactical aircraft procurement is seen as a tradeoff. The administration's proposal includes prioritizing funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for irregular warfare operations. There is a debate on funding for sea-based tactical aircraft (F/A-18E/F and F-35 Bs and Cs) versus land-based Air Force tactical aircraft (F-22 and F-35A), with discussions on capabilities and costs. The proposal suggests ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focusing on the F-35A for future Air Force tactical aircraft procurement, which is viewed as a tradeoff. Funding decisions involve tradeoffs between procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs, service life extensions of existing tactical aircraft, and procurement of new or upgraded models of older-design tactical aircraft. Examples include upgraded F-15s instead of additional F-22s, upgraded F-16s instead of some planned F-35As, additional F/A-18E/Fs instead of some planned F-35Cs and Bs, and service life extensions of F/A-18A-Ds instead of procuring new F/A-18E/Fs or F-35Cs and Bs. Each tradeoff poses complex questions of comparative costs and capabilities. The potential tradeoffs in U.S. military procurement decisions involve upgrading existing aircraft models or extending the service life of older aircraft instead of procuring new ones. These tradeoffs raise questions about costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility, which have been extensively studied and debated in the context of U.S. military goals and objectives. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is currently reviewing military priorities, including the balance between preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional warfare. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is reviewing U.S. military goals and objectives, including the balance between preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional warfare. There is a debate on the need for high-capability tactical aircraft in current military operations. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is reassessing U.S. military objectives, debating the necessity of high-capability tactical aircraft for current operations. Some argue for reducing procurement of these aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, and other specialized aircraft, while others emphasize the continued need for advanced aircraft due to potential threats from Russian and other adversaries. The necessity of tactical aircraft remains due to potential threats from Russian and other adversaries, as well as concerns about advanced aircraft and surface-to-air missiles being acquired by countries like China and India. This has led to discussions about the importance of maintaining a large number of advanced aircraft for future conflicts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the Department of Defense's investment planning in response to a request from Representative Neil Abercrombie. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the Department of Defense's investment planning for acquiring new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones. Over the next 7 years, $109.3 billion will be spent on 570 new aircraft. However, cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities. For example, the development period for the F-22A doubled, and new threat conditions emerged. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the Department of Defense's investment planning for acquiring new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones. $109.3 billion will be spent on 570 new aircraft, but cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities. The F-22A development period doubled, threat conditions changed, and unit costs more than doubled, leading to a decline in the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure. Similar issues are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), with increased development costs and slipping schedules. The JSF is crucial for future modernization efforts, but faces challenges in funding and delivery schedules. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is crucial for future modernization efforts, but faces challenges with increased development costs and slipping schedules. Funding needs and plans for new and legacy aircraft are interdependent, with uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries making it challenging to effectively plan and implement modernization efforts. Legacy systems must be sustained and kept operationally relevant until new systems are ready to replace them. If quantities of new aircraft are reduced or deliveries slip further, more unplanned money will be required to sustain and modernize legacy systems. As deliveries slip further into future years, more unplanned money will be needed to sustain, modernize, and extend the life of legacy systems. Uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries hinders effective planning and implementation of modernization efforts. The services are investing about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but there are billions more in unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan for recapitalizing and modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. The DOD lacks a single, comprehensive investment plan for recapitalizing and modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Each military service operates independently to acquire resources for its force structure construct, leading to underperformance in delivering aircraft. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft are imminent, with billions in unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs identified. The military services operate independently to acquire resources for their force structure construct, leading to underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels, as they rely on unrealistic assumptions about cost, quantity, and delivery schedules for new acquisitions. This is compounded by projected declines in future federal discretionary spending and continued operational support requirements for the global war on terror. The military services operate independently to acquire resources for their force structure construct, leading to underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels, as they rely on unrealistic assumptions about cost, quantity, and delivery schedules for new acquisitions. GAO recommends that DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing and executing plans for tactical air forces. GAO recommends that DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing and delivering new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated enterprise-level investment strategy for tactical air forces. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans and the potential implications for long-term budget and inventory levels. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2009 plans. The study compares seven alternative approaches for modernizing the fighter forces, including options to maintain inventory requirements and replace portions of the fighter force with longer-range aircraft. The report highlights the importance of meeting the services' goals for modernizing their fighter forces. The report from May 2009 discusses modernizing fighter forces by maintaining inventory requirements and replacing some aircraft with longer-range ones. This modernization would result in increased capability with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities. The emphasis is on enhancing survivability and not just increasing flight endurance. The DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans aim to modernize fighter forces with advanced aircraft offering increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities for enhanced survivability. However, the unrefueled ranges of newer aircraft may not increase significantly, potentially leading to fighter inventories falling below stated goals. Despite this, aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to the enhanced lethality and survivability of the new fighters, although potential adversaries' increased capabilities could offset some of these improvements. The DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans aim to modernize fighter forces with advanced aircraft offering increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities for enhanced survivability. The new fighters are expected to equal or improve relative to today's force, with potential adversaries' increased capabilities possibly offsetting some improvements. Alternative approaches like purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements compared to purchasing JSFs. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would offer a different set of advantages. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft could provide comparable air-to-ground weapons capacities at similar costs, but with fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Tactical aircraft modernization decisions can impact workloads and force structures. The United States currently has two active prime contractors for the production of tactical aircraft\u2014Lockheed and Boeing. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact workloads, revenues, and employment levels in the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact employment levels and the structure of the industry. The U.S. currently has two prime contractors for tactical aircraft production - Lockheed and Boeing. Concerns have been raised that reducing the number of prime contractors to one (Lockheed) could limit competition, innovation, and quality in future aircraft development. Congress may need to consider the implications of this potential change. The prospective development could impact competition, innovation, and quality in future U.S. tactical aircraft procurement. Congress may need to consider the number of prime contractors needed, the value of competition, and the potential impact on firms like Boeing and Lockheed. The potential for Boeing to use its aircraft design skills to compete with Lockheed for future tactical aircraft contracts is discussed in legislative activity for FY2010. Section 133 of H.R. 2647 requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. Section 133 of H.R. 2647 mandates a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, specifically F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must include the number of these aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 to maintain the Air Force's requirement of at least 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, along with estimated procurement costs. The report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 must include the number needed to maintain the Air Force's requirement of 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, estimated procurement costs for single and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear procurement contracts. The report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 must include a discussion on the availability and feasibility of F-35s to recapitalize the Air National Guard, recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract, and required certifications if Congress authorizes the contract. The Secretary recommends authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 with advanced capabilities. Certification submissions required alongside the budget for fiscal year 2011. Definition of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft includes AESA radar, high capacity data-link, enhanced avionics, and ability to deploy advanced armaments. Section 1032 mandates a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The current fighter aircraft, such as the F-15, F-16, and F/A-18, must have advanced capabilities like AESA radar, high capacity data-link, and enhanced avionics, as well as the ability to deploy advanced armaments. Section 1032 requires a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, including details on factors influencing decisions regarding fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The QDR report outlines factors influencing decisions on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, including threat capabilities, modeling simulations, unmanned aerial vehicle inventories, and operational risks. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress, addressing combat air forces restructuring plans. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring any fighter aircraft or reassigning Air Force personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. Funding must continue for the operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. The funds authorized for operations and maintenance for the Air Force must allocate at least $344,600,000 for the continued operation of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Additionally, $10,500,000 from the procurement funds should be used for necessary modifications to sustain these aircraft. A report detailing the plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement actions, assessment of the current threat environment, and current capabilities must be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate. A detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps from retirement actions must be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services. This plan should include an assessment of the current threat environment, follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding requirements for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. The detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps from retirement actions must include an assessment of the current threat environment, follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding requirements for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. The prohibition on certain aircraft retirements in fiscal year 2010 does not apply to five fighter aircraft. The future-years defense plan aims to modernize the remaining fighter force to outpace threats. An exception allows for the retirement of five fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010. Congress expresses the need for the Navy to maintain at least 10 carrier air wings. Congress finds that the Navy must maintain at least 10 carrier air wings, each with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft. Despite the benefits of fifth-generation assets, most fighter aircraft in carrier air wings will not be fifth-generation. The House Armed Services Committee emphasizes the importance of maintaining 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft each, even if they are not fifth-generation assets. The Secretary of the Navy is urged to allocate resources to ensure this requirement is met. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. This could create gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available for deployment. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. This could lead to serious gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available for deployment. The committee has identified $143.7 million in unjustified program growth and $200.9 million in unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget, recommending these funds totaling $344.6 million be used for continued operations. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. The committee has identified $200.9 million in unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget, recommending these funds be used for the continued operation and maintenance of the legacy fighters until reporting requirements are met. Additionally, $10.5 million for aircraft procurement should be available for necessary modifications to sustain the fighter aircraft. The Air Force has informed Congress of the need for 2,200 fighter aircraft. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010. The committee has identified funds for modifications necessary to sustain the fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall in its fighter aircraft inventory, which could grow to approximately 800 aircraft by 2024, affecting the ability to meet future requirements for air expeditionary forces and air sovereignty alert missions. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report on this matter. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010. The committee has identified funds for modifications necessary to sustain the fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall in its fighter aircraft inventory, which could grow to approximately 800 aircraft by 2024, affecting the ability to meet future requirements for air expeditionary forces and air sovereignty alert missions. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report on this matter by March 1, 2010, including alternative solutions for the \"fighter gap\" issue. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to address the fighter gap issue by considering alternative solutions such as accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, interim procurement of 4.5 generation fighters, and fleet management options. The report must analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission, including potential loss of flying missions and pilot and maintenance capability. The committee is also concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. The committee believes such drastic shortfalls are unacceptable due to various factors causing the current and forecasted strike-fighter inventory issues. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors causing the shortfall include decisions to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory, a reduction in the F-35B/C program quantity, delays in F-35B/C development, and early service life expiration of F/A-18A through D aircraft. The committee remains unconvinced that naval strike-fighter shortfalls should be viewed in isolation from the overall Department of Defense strike-fighter inventory. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall. They believe that a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than other options. The committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address inventory shortfall and maintain carrier air wings with strike-fighters. Congressional sense is to prioritize procurement over extending service life of older aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address inventory shortfall and maintain carrier air wings with strike-fighters. Congress directs a report on extending service life of older aircraft versus procuring new ones. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address inventory shortfall and maintain carrier air wings with strike-fighters. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to the retirement of older F/A-18A-D Hornets before the F-35C variant is available. They are disappointed that the Navy has not provided a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated by previous committee reports. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address inventory shortfall and maintain carrier air wings with strike-fighters. The Navy has failed to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated by previous committee reports. The projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall is a concern due to the retirement of older F/A-18A-D Hornets before the F-35C variant is available. The Chief of Naval Operations stated that the projected gap may be as high as 250 aircraft total for the Department of the Navy. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address inventory shortfall and maintain carrier air wings with strike-fighters. The Navy's projected shortfall of 125 aircraft in 2017, including requirements of the United States Marine Corps, may actually be as high as 250 aircraft according to the Chief of Naval Operations. The committee is concerned about the Navy's failure to present a budget that effectively addresses this increased shortfall in the Department of the Navy's tactical air fleet, posing potential risks to national security. The delay in taking action regarding the F-35C's initial operation capability in 2015 is also worrisome. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft to address inventory shortfall and maintain carrier air wings with strike-fighters. The committee is concerned about the Navy's delay in taking action to address the projected shortfall in the tactical air fleet, potentially risking national security. The Navy's reliance on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s and lack of realistic procurement plans for carrier strike aircraft are also worrisome. The committee is concerned about the Navy's reliance on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s, with uncertainties about reaching 10,000 flight hours and lack of realistic procurement plans for carrier strike aircraft. The Navy's costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s is estimated to cost $26.0 million per plane, with uncertainties about reaching 10,000 flight hours. The committee questions the efficiency of this program compared to procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft, which could cost less than $50.0 million each. A SLEP to achieve an additional 1,400 flight hours would cost approximately $18,571 per flight hour gained, while a new F/A-18E/F would cost $8,333 per flight hour. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities such as active electronically scanned array radar, modernized avionics, advanced aerial refueling system capability, and added weapon systems. The committee recommends evaluating costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements versus investing in a SLEP for legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer advanced technological capabilities like radar, avionics, refueling system, and weapon hard points, increasing the benefits of purchasing them. The Navy projects the F/A-18E/F to remain in the fleet until 2040 and expects to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects the Department of Defense to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review and analyze the cost differences between single year and multiyear procurement strategies for the F/A-18E/F. This analysis should inform the decision on implementing the results of the Quadrennial Defense Review regarding tactical aviation procurement strategies. The Department of Defense should consider cost differences between SLEP and new procurements of the F/A-18E/F in implementing Quadrennial Defense Review results on tactical aviation. Additional actions to address the strike-fighter shortfall should not be delayed. H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84 requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft. The conference version of H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84 contains a provision requiring the Department of Defense to submit a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft. It also mandates a report on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. Additionally, Section 1075 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report on the combat air forces restructuring plan is submitted to Congress. Section 131 of H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days. The report must detail the number of aircraft needed from 2011 to 2025 to meet Air Force requirements. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, detailing the number needed from 2011 to 2025 to meet Air Force requirements, estimated costs for annual and multiyear procurement contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft includes details on estimated savings from multiyear contracts, costs and benefits comparison with annual contracts, and the availability of F-35 aircraft for Air National Guard re-capitalization from 2015 to 2025. The Air National Guard will procure 4.5 generation fighter aircraft from 2015 to 2025, including F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities and armaments. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on force structure findings alongside the 2009 quadrennial defense review. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on force structure findings alongside the 2009 quadrennial defense review, including analyses supporting the findings and changes to minimum military requirements for major military capabilities. The term \"major military capabilities\" encompasses capabilities deemed significant by the Secretary, those discussed in the 2006 quadrennial defense review report, and those outlined in specific sections of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 1075 of the report addresses Combat Air Forces restructuring, prohibiting the retirement of fighter aircraft and personnel reassignments until the Secretary of the Air Force submits a required report. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring any fighter aircraft or reassigning personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. A detailed report must be submitted to Congress outlining plans to address force structure gaps, assessment of threat environment, mission assignments for affected bases, and criteria for selecting bases. The detailed plan includes addressing force structure and capability gaps, assessing threat environment, assigning missions to affected bases, selecting bases for retirement, conducting environmental analyses, identifying manpower authorizations, outlining funding needs for 2010-2015, estimating cost avoidance, and potential restructuring plan implementation. The detailed plan includes addressing force structure and capability gaps, assessing threat environment, assigning missions to affected bases, selecting bases for retirement, conducting environmental analyses, identifying manpower authorizations, outlining funding needs for 2010-2015, estimating cost avoidance, and potential restructuring plan implementation. The plan also includes a description of the funding needed in fiscal years 2010 through 2015 to cover operation and maintenance costs, personnel, and aircraft procurement if the restructuring plan is not carried out. It further outlines an estimate of the cost avoidance and how funds would be invested to ensure the remaining fighter force achieves the desired service life and is sufficiently modernized to outpace the threat. The prohibition in subsection (a)(1) does not apply to the five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. The sense of Congress is that the Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings in addition to the required 11 operational aircraft carriers. This commitment includes 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, as stated in Section 1076. The Navy is committed to maintaining 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, in addition to the required 11 operational aircraft carriers. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy are urged to ensure this requirement is met until modifications are justified and supported by warfighting analysis. The Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should ensure the current requirement of 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing is met until modifications are justified and supported by warfighting analysis. The Department of the Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a smaller, more flexible, lethal, and capable strike fighter force is acknowledged as challenging. The Air Force is expected to analyze the viability of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract when necessary. The Air Force is transitioning to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force. Congress expects analysis on procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract, specifically F-15, F-16, and F-18. The conferees intend for the Air Force to analyze the potential for a multiyear purchase of additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities. This provision does not alter existing requirements under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code. (Page 682) The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. These concerns were also raised in the House-passed version of the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act. The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. They are worried about the premature implementation of the restructure, personnel costs, and potential acquisition costs associated with the proposal to remove training of F-15 pilots from Tyndall Air Force Base. The Committee is concerned about the premature implementation of the Air Force's plan to retire legacy aircraft and the potential costs associated with removing F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base. They have directed the Department to provide a cost benefit analysis of this proposal for Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The analysis will include factors impacting F-15 training quantity and quality at each location, as well as the establishment and maintenance of training programs. The Committee requests a report on the establishment and maintenance of F-15 Basic Crew Chief Training, Air Control Squadron Training, and Intelligence Formal Training at various locations. They also want analysis on simulator and ancillary training access, instructor base quality, military construction requirements, and costs. Additionally, the Department is asked to identify airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations and provide policy analysis on training and operational mission impacts. The Committee requests the Department to identify airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations in the continental United States. They also ask for an analysis of the training and operational mission impacts at these bases. An independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) on the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces is directed. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to provide reports no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act, and no funds can be obligated for the Combat Air Force restructure until all reports are submitted to the congressional defense committees. (Pages 62-63) The report addresses the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The report highlights the Navy's strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo, causing aging of F-18 aircraft and critical inventory shortages. No funds can be used for Combat Air Force restructure until all reports are submitted to congressional defense committees. The Navy is facing critical inventory shortages in its strike fighter fleet due to high operational tempo causing accelerated aging of F-18 aircraft. Delays in the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter have worsened the shortfall, now estimated to be over 200 aircraft. The life extension of older F-18 variants and reduced purchases in fiscal year 2010 have contributed to the problem. The Navy is facing a shortfall of over 200 aircraft due to delays in the F-35 program and aging F-18 variants. Reductions in purchases for fiscal year 2010 have worsened the situation, despite the production of F/A-18E/F variant aircraft still ongoing. The Navy is facing a shortfall of over 200 aircraft due to delays in the F-35 program and aging F-18 variants. The production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The Committee believes the Navy is missing out on significant savings by not entering into another multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft. The recommendation provides $108,000,000 above the request for the procurement of long lead equipment in an economic order quantity and cost. The Navy is facing a shortfall of over 200 aircraft due to delays in the F-35 program and aging F-18 variants. The Committee believes significant savings can be achieved by purchasing aircraft under a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F. The recommendation includes $108,000,000 for long lead equipment and cost reduction initiatives for a five-year, 150 aircraft multi-year procurement. Additionally, $495,000,000 is allocated for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the strike fighter shortfall. The Senate Appropriations Committee provides $495,000,000 for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18E/F Aircraft to address the Navy's strike fighter shortfall caused by aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 program. The Committee is concerned about the shortfall estimated to be at least 129 aircraft and encourages the Navy to pursue a multi-year procurement approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee provides an increase of $512,280,000 to procure nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010 to address the Navy's aircraft shortfall. The Committee encourages the Navy to pursue a multi-year procurement contract for these aircraft. The Senate approved an amendment prohibiting the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to fill the capability gaps.
