The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, well-lit, and well-maintained environment. Many schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures are common issues in school buildings. Over the next 10 years, 6,000 new schools will be needed to accommodate the growing number of students. Poor ventilation, lighting, and temperature control in schools can hinder students' performance. Efficient water use and a holistic design approach can result in high-performance school buildings. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation leads to high-performance buildings, improved student and teacher performance, lower life-cycle costs, and energy conservation savings. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation leads to high-performance buildings, improved student and teacher performance, and lower life-cycle costs. Systematic energy conservation in construction projects can save money for teachers and materials. Using renewable energy sources in low-energy buildings can meet energy needs without emissions. Environmentally preferable products and fresh air supplies improve indoor air quality in school buildings. The Act aims to help school districts create high-performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly school buildings. Many districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for efficient construction. Congress is considering legislation to support new school construction and renovations. The Act aims to support school districts in creating energy-efficient and environmentally friendly school buildings. Congress is considering legislation to assist with new school construction and renovations through program establishment and administration. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements. Grants must achieve a 30% increase in energy efficiency beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels for new and existing buildings. Grants under subsection (b)(1) are for school districts to achieve 30% energy efficiency beyond 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels for new and existing buildings. Districts must demonstrate need, lack of funds, and commitment to develop high performance school buildings with the grant funds. Grants under subsection (b)(2) are for evaluating compliance with the Act, distributing information on high performance school buildings, and organizing programs for schools. The Act allows grants to be used for promoting high performance school buildings through distributing information, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants also aim to encourage participation in compliance evaluation and information dissemination. Grants can be used for planning, designing, and monitoring high performance school buildings. They also promote participation through marketing activities and coordinating public benefit programs. Grants are provided to school districts with developed plans in consultation with State offices of energy and education. Grants are provided to school districts with developed plans in consultation with State offices of energy and education, encouraging them to supplement grant funds with other sources for implementation. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. Funds appropriated for the implementation of this Act shall be provided to Governors of the States, who will determine the State agency to administer the assistance program to school districts. Funds allocated under section 5 will be divided with 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. The Secretary of Education may retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program established under section 3(a). These funds can be used to develop reference materials for high-performance school buildings. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding as needed for the following 6 years. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines a \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, and enhances indoor environmental quality. \"Renewable energy\" refers to sustainable energy sources. A high performance school building maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, enhances indoor environmental quality, conserves water, and optimizes site potential. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
