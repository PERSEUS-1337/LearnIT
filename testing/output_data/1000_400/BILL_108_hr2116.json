The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that operated from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining activities caused water pumping due to the Boone Aquifer, and much of the mining occurred on Indian land. During mining operations at the Tar Creek Superfund Site, large volumes of water were pumped from underground mine workings. The mining activities took place on Indian land controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and contributed significantly to the Nation's wartime lead and zinc consumption. Millions of tons of waste tailings were created, with recommendations to stockpile them aboveground for later reprocessing. Congress passed legislation in 1960 related to lead production at the site. In the 1970s, as mining declined, water filled the underground mine workings at the Tar Creek Superfund Site, leading to the formation of acid mine water that began discharging at the surface in 1979. In the 1970s, water filled the underground mine workings at the Tar Creek Superfund Site, leading to the formation of acid mine water that began discharging at the surface in 1979. Despite efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency starting in 1984 to remediate the acid mine water, it was deemed essentially impossible in 1994 after spending millions of dollars. The Site has over 1,300 mine shafts and 100,000 boreholes, with many open mine shafts still posing a source of contamination. The Environmental Protection Agency concluded that it was impossible to remediate the acid mine water at the Site due to the presence of open mine shafts, boreholes, and stockpiled chat laced with toxic heavy metals. This chat contributes to flood problems and recharges underground mine workings. The stockpiled chat at the Site contains toxic heavy metals, including lead, which has contaminated residential areas. In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency started remediation work on yards with unsafe lead levels, as studies show elevated blood lead levels in many children at the Site. In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency began remediation of residential areas contaminated with heavy metals, including lead. Studies show elevated blood lead levels in children at the Site, which can cause severe health problems. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a health risk, and underground cavities from mining have led to cave-ins near populated areas and schools. Scientific studies indicate that dust from stockpiled chat at the Site poses a health risk. There have been repeated cave-ins, some larger than 100 feet in diameter, due to underground cavities left by mining. No government agency has taken action to address the chat or subsidence dangers. The Site has not been subject to comprehensive epidemiological studies and is deemed unsafe for human habitation due to its unique environmental problems. The assistance provided in Section 3 addresses the health risks posed by stockpiled chat dust at the Site, as well as the dangers of cave-ins due to underground cavities left by mining activities. No government agency has taken action to address these issues, and the Site is deemed unsafe for human habitation. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the 17 square mile area identified in Governor Keating's Tar Creek Superfund Task Force Final Report. The EPA is responsible for the application of the Act and must continue its responsibility for the cleanup of the Tar Creek Superfund site. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the cleanup of the Tar Creek Superfund site and must work with other officials to find a comprehensive resolution to the environmental and health issues related to the site."
