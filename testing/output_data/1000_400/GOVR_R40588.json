    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus, initially called \"swine flu,\" emerged. The World Health Organization explained that the virus resulted from the reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. This type of genetic mixing had been observed in pigs since 1998 and can also occur in humans. The current influenza A (H1N1) virus is a result of this reassortment, containing genes from swine, avian, and human sources. The currently circulating influenza A (H1N1) virus is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human genes. Its origin and when/where it occurred are unknown. The virus is now spreading from human to human. It is referred to as Influenza A(H1N1) by WHO and 2009 H1N1 flu by CDC. It is less lethal than H5N1 avian flu but more lethal than seasonal flu. The H1N1 virus, also known as 2009 H1N1 flu, is currently under investigation. It is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but less lethal than H5N1 avian influenza. The virus has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic, but researchers are unsure of its full virulence. Cases of H1N1 were reported in California and Texas, with gene segments from swine flu viruses detected in some patients. Mexico also reported cases of a new influenza strain affecting the country. The H1N1 virus, with gene segments from swine flu viruses, affected children who had no contact with pigs. CDC reported more cases in California and Texas. Mexico announced a new influenza strain with over 1,000 suspected cases, leading to school closures and event cancellations. WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 due to human cases in Canada and Spain. On April 27, 2009, WHO reported human cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. Two days later, the pandemic alert level was raised to Phase 5, indicating human-to-human spread in at least two countries. On June 11, 2009, the alert level was raised to Phase 6, the highest level. The declaration of Phase 5 signaled an imminent pandemic, with Phase 6 being the highest alert level. WHO reported over 50,000 confirmed H1N1 cases in 80 countries with 231 deaths as of June 22, 2009. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 confirmed H1N1 cases in more than 80 countries with 231 deaths. The number of cases reflects only those confirmed by laboratory testing. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they would have little effect on stopping the virus spread. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they would have little effect on stopping the spread of the H1N1 virus. Most people with H1N1 experience influenza-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment, although drugs can help reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness. The strain of H1N1 circulating globally is a new virus, and only a small number of infected individuals have received antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in treating H1N1 patients, reducing symptoms and duration of illness. WHO has a global stockpile of oseltamivir for treatment, distributing 3 million courses to developing countries. No vaccine is currently available for H1N1. WHO has a global stockpile of 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir donated after H5N1 outbreaks. 3 million courses are being distributed to developing countries. No vaccine is available for H1N1, but efforts are underway to develop one, which could take 5-6 months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis plans to produce 1-2 billion vaccine doses annually once developed. The WHO and CDC are working on developing a vaccine for H1N1, which could take 5-6 months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO. China has quarantined Mexican nationals, leading to Mexico halting flights to China. Mexico and China have implemented travel restrictions in response to the H1N1 outbreak. Other countries have also advised against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC initially recommended avoiding travel to Mexico but later downgraded the advisory. The decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico was defended. The European Union Health Commissioner and CDC advised against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC downgraded the travel advisory to a \"travel health precaution\" on May 15, 2009. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico due to the strain of the virus already present in the country. Closing U.S. borders due to the strain of the virus already present in the country is not feasible. Focus should be on mitigating the virus. Some countries are using thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures. Egypt has ordered the slaughter of pigs, and some countries have banned pork imports to prevent the spread of H1N1. Several countries have taken actions to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals, including Egypt ordering the slaughter of pigs. Some countries have also banned pork imports from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks, providing over $16 million in aid to Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States has provided over $16 million in aid to Latin America and the Caribbean to assist with H1N1 outbreaks. The aid focuses on commodity delivery, disease detection, and surveillance. USAID also donated personal protection equipment kits and disinfectant supplies to Vietnam. USAID provided support to Vietnam by donating personal protection equipment kits and disinfectant supplies valued at over $57,000 to help animal health workers respond quickly to potential new outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. CDC, as a WHO collaborating center, receives viral samples from many countries, including Mexico, and develops reagents used to detect influenza subtypes worldwide. The CDC influenza laboratory in Atlanta, a WHO collaborating center, receives viral samples from various countries, including Mexico. They create reagents to detect influenza subtypes and distribute testing kits to public health labs worldwide. CDC also sends experts to strengthen lab capacity and train health professionals during outbreaks. HHS Secretary Sebelius announced the distribution of 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico, part of a plan to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. The HHS Secretary announced the distribution of 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico, valued at $10 million, as part of a plan to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in influenza epidemiology, laboratory, health communications, and emergency operations. Teams aim to understand the severity and transmission patterns of H1N1 and improve laboratory capacity. The CDC teams, along with experts from Mexico, Canada, and the US, are working to understand the severity and transmission patterns of H1N1. They aim to improve laboratory capacity in Mexico and collaborate with other organizations globally. CDC also supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries through various means. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries by sending experts to work with WHO offices or ministries of health and providing funding through cooperative agreements. USAID has allocated $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with a focus on advanced disease surveillance and control measures in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes support for animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with $0.9 million directed at H1N1 response efforts in Mexico, $0.2 million in Panama, and $5 million to the region. Assistance includes support to FAO for animal surveillance in Mexico and Latin America, distribution of 100,000 PPE kits valued at over $1 million, and pre-positioning 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries. USAID also held a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia as part of its H2P Initiative. USAID pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries as part of its Humanitarian Pandemic Preparedness Initiative. A pandemic preparedness exercise was held in Ethiopia, bringing together stakeholders from nine East African countries to develop response plans and test existing ones. During a pandemic preparedness exercise, government and military representatives met to establish coordination principles, develop a response action plan, and test existing plans. The simulation exercise helped identify weaknesses and improve preparedness for potential influenza outbreaks. USAID plans to conduct similar exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009, working with the Department of Defense. USAID, in collaboration with the Department of Defense, is conducting pandemic preparedness exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009. They are working with military representatives from 30 countries in Africa and Asia to ensure readiness for cooperation with civilian authorities during a pandemic. Additionally, joint exercises involving PACOM, AFRICOM, and the World Food Program have been conducted in 27 African and Asian countries to enhance military preparedness for pandemics. In May 2009, USAID conducted a joint pandemic preparedness exercise with military representatives from 27 African and Asian countries. Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic response, including H5N1 avian flu and H1N1. The U.S. has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, representing 30.9% of international donor pledges. The U.S. Department of State announced in October 2008 that the United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, making it the largest single donor. The funds have supported international efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The U.S. pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. Funds were allocated for bilateral activities, support to international organizations, regional programs, global contingency, technical assistance, humanitarian aid, research, and wild bird surveillance. The U.S. pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, including funding for disease detection sites, global contingency, international assistance, research, wild bird surveillance, stockpiles of supplies, and global communications. The U.S. pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, including supplies like PPE kits, laboratory specimen collection kits, and decontamination kits. The contributions by agency are as follows: USAID $542 million, HHS $353 million, USDA $37 million, DOD $10 million, and DOS $7 million. President Barack Obama requested $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for pandemic preparedness. President Barack Obama requested $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for U.S. domestic and international pandemic preparedness and response activities. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities, with no specified amount for international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with concerns heightened by outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. The report did not specify how much of the $200 million CDC should spend on international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with recent outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS raising concerns. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 has shown the threat posed by infectious diseases, with 75% of recent diseases originating from animals. Effective responses require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the United States and other international players to prepare for infectious diseases like H1N1 have led to significant progress in developing tests, treatments, and a global surveillance system. However, concerns remain about poorer countries lacking the capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1 effectively. It is cautioned that complacency should not set in despite the progress made. Some health experts are concerned about poorer countries lacking capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1 effectively. Transmission of influenza viruses tends to accelerate in winter months, especially in the Southern hemisphere where cases are beginning to be reported. Questions remain about potential gene reassortment, particularly in countries also dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Questions remain about the potential for gene reassortment in countries simultaneously dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. Health experts are debating whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system or develop an alert system based on severity to prevent panic and economic disruptions. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, despite concerns about potential panic and economic disruptions. Director General Margaret Chan emphasized that the shift did not indicate a change in severity. WHO also updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide to more accurately reflect pandemic risk and the epidemiological situation. WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6 on June 11, 2009, with Director General Margaret Chan emphasizing that the shift did not indicate a change in severity. WHO also updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide to better reflect pandemic risk and the epidemiological situation. USAID announced a new five-year emerging pandemic threats program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans. USAID announced a new five-year emerging pandemic threats program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans, such as SARS, H5N1, and HIV/AIDS. The program aims to establish a network of laboratories in Africa to improve the diagnosis of new emergent pathogens. Some concerns have been raised about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries confirming human cases of H1N1. Some observers are concerned about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries confirming human cases of H1N1. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are in poor condition, reflecting limited public health and surveillance capacity. CDC and USAID are working to improve laboratory and disease surveillance capacity in African countries. CDC has sent H1N1 testing kits to 237 laboratories in 107 countries, including 18 in Africa. The limited number of sub-Saharan countries confirming human cases of H1N1 reflects weak laboratory and surveillance capacity. Efforts by CDC, USAID, and international health experts aim to improve these systems, with H1N1 testing kits sent to laboratories worldwide. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poorer countries has been a longstanding issue, highlighted during HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poorer countries has been a longstanding issue, highlighted during HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. Discussions about access resurfaced at the peak of global H5N1 avian flu outbreaks, with concerns raised about affordability and hoarding of vaccines. The link between access, poverty, and health has been well-documented, with USAID estimating that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines. WHO estimates that over 90% of global capacity to develop influenza vaccines is located in Europe and North America, leaving poorer countries at a disadvantage. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poorer countries has been a longstanding issue, highlighted during HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. WHO estimates that about 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines, with over 50% of the poorest areas in Africa and Asia lacking access. Concerns arise about the hoarding of treatments and vaccines by richer countries in the event of a pandemic. WHO reported that national authorities, not the organization, would conduct mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns if a vaccine is developed. Some experts raise concerns about poorer countries' ability to administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO expects national authorities to handle H1N1 vaccination efforts. Approximately 1.4 million deaths in children under five could have been prevented by routine vaccines. Health experts fear other factors could impact the severity of the circulating H1N1 strain, such as the presence of H5N1 bird flu strains. Approximately 1.4 million deaths in children under five years of age could have been prevented by routine vaccination. Health experts, including the WHO, are concerned about the potential for H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 strains to reassort and create a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. Concerns about the likelihood of an influenza pandemic from H5N1 began in 2004 when human cases were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. In January 2004, Thailand and Viet Nam reported their first human cases of avian influenza H5N1, sparking concerns of a potential pandemic. By 2006, 50 countries worldwide had confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. The disease has become endemic in Asia, and experts are monitoring for potential H1N1 outbreaks in countries with ongoing H5N1 cases. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu is more deadly but less easily transmissible than H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds."
