    "content": "In response to reports of the NSA conducting a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), a national debate arose regarding the program's legality under FISA, the need for additional authority, and Congressional oversight. The TSP involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill. The Bush Administration defended the Terrorist Surveillance Program, citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill in response to the NSA's secret Terrorist Surveillance Program. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), enacted in 1978, provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence. Bills introduced in Congress address oversight of surveillance programs for detecting and preventing terrorist threats. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information, including the use of physical searches and trap and trace devices. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked the speed and agility to combat terrorism effectively. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders authorizing the collection of international communications related to terrorism. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that FISC orders authorized the collection of international communications related to terrorism, specifically targeting members or agents of al Qaeda or associated terrorist organizations. Surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval, and the President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The Attorney General informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval, and the President has decided not to reauthorize the program when the current authorization expires. The NSA program has faced legal and constitutional challenges, including a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor declaring it unconstitutional. The NSA program has faced legal and constitutional challenges, with a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor declaring it unconstitutional. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor declared the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional under Title III and permanently enjoined it. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which stayed the judgment pending appeal. Measures S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 aim to create a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. Measures S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 propose creating a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs and amend other provisions related to electronic surveillance under FISA. The bills propose changes to electronic surveillance under FISA, including authorizing surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, limitations on liability for aiding the government in surveillance, and modifications to definitions and criminal provisions. Additionally, the bills would address those involved in weapons of mass destruction and international movements of surveillance targets. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to electronic surveillance under FISA, including authorizing surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes and addressing those involved in weapons of mass destruction. Sec. 3 of S. 3931 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. The new Section 701 of FISA defines an \"electronic surveillance program\" for gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. Section 702(a) of FISA would give jurisdiction to the FISC to review and authorize such programs. The FISC has jurisdiction to review and authorize electronic surveillance programs under new Section 702(a) of FISA. Initial authorization can be up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. The Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal denials to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal denials to the FIS Court of Review for authorization of electronic surveillance programs under FISA. If criteria for electronic surveillance of a target under FISA are met, surveillance must be discontinued unless certain conditions are met. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of a target under FISA unless certain conditions are met. If surveillance continues under Title VII, an application must be made for an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance under Section 105 of FISA. New bills also allow for the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat. The bills authorize the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat to the FIS Court of Review, triggered by the Attorney General's affidavit stating national security concerns. The proposed language in new Section 702(b)(1) of FISA requires the originating court to transfer cases involving national security concerns to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for further proceedings. However, there is uncertainty in the language, as it is not clear if the transfer would be to the FIS Court of Review. The FISC is given jurisdiction to determine standing and legality in proposed subsection 702(b)(2) of FISA. The proposed subsection 702(b)(2) of FISA gives jurisdiction to the FISC to determine standing and legality in national security cases. Any disclosure of national security information in a criminal proceeding would be governed by specific acts. Decisions made by the FISC under this subsection can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review. Under proposed subsection 702(b)(3), decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. Challenges to electronic surveillance programs can be dismissed by the FISC or originating court for any legal reason, with litigation privileges preserved. Additionally, a new Section 703 of FISA is created under Sec. 5 of S. 3931, Sec. 205 of S. 3929. Under new subsection 702(b)(4), the FISC or originating court may dismiss challenges to electronic surveillance programs for any legal reason, with litigation privileges preserved. A new Section 703 of FISA is created under Sec. 5 of S. 3931, outlining requirements for applications for approval of such programs. Subsection 703(b) allows the FISC to request necessary information from the Attorney General for decision-making. Additionally, a new subsection 704 sets out the necessary findings and contents of an ex parte FISC order approving an electronic surveillance program. The FISC may dismiss challenges to electronic surveillance programs for any legal reason under new subsection 702(b)(4). Section 704 of FISA outlines the necessary findings and contents of an ex parte FISC order approving such a program. Section 705 of FISA addresses congressional oversight, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The Attorney General is required to submit classified reports every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees on activities under electronic surveillance programs authorized under new Title VII of FISA. Amendments to FISA are made in Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929. Sec. 8(a) of S. 3931, Sec. 208(a) of S. 3929, repeals Sections 111, 309, and 404 of FISA, allowing the President to authorize surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days after a declaration of war. The proposed legislation allows for electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress, in accordance with specific exceptions outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. The proposed legislation allows for electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress, in accordance with specific exceptions outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. This amendment clarifies that officers, employees, or agents of the United States can conduct electronic surveillance under the Constitution or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 without it being unlawful. The \"exclusivity\" provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) allows the United States Government to acquire foreign intelligence information from international communications using means other than electronic surveillance as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This provision ensures that electronic surveillance and interception of domestic communications must adhere to the procedures outlined in the relevant laws. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) states that electronic surveillance can only be conducted under specific laws such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, chapter 119, or chapter 121. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address Section 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809, which provides criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance in the United States. The amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 increase penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance under FISA. Penalties include fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Additional amendments to FISA are also made. The penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance under FISA would be increased to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Additional amendments to FISA definitions are also included in the legislation. The legislation includes amendments to FISA definitions, such as expanding the definition of \"foreign power\" and updating the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional surveillance of a known person. The legislation updates the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA to include intentional surveillance of a known person in the United States with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The legislation updates the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA to include intentional surveillance of a known person in the United States with a reasonable expectation of privacy. This definition is more expansive than current law and includes minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons and allow for the retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity. The legislation updates the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA to include intentional surveillance of a known person in the United States with a reasonable expectation of privacy. This includes minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons and allow for the retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity, while also permitting the retention and dissemination of nonpublicly available information for foreign intelligence purposes. The legislation updates FISA's definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to protect the privacy of U.S. persons. It includes minimization procedures to prevent disclosure of communication involving a U.S. person unless authorized by court order or in case of threat. Proposed changes would replace current procedures with new language. The proposed changes to FISA include new minimization procedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons in electronic surveillance, ensuring that no communication involving a U.S. person is disclosed, disseminated, used, or retained for longer than 7 days without a court order or in case of a threat. The proposed changes to FISA aim to protect the privacy of U.S. persons in electronic surveillance by limiting the disclosure, dissemination, use, and retention of communications involving a U.S. person to 7 days without a court order or in case of a threat. The definition of \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" under FISA would be revised under the proposed legislation. The proposed changes to FISA include revising the definition of \"contents\" to include information about the substance of a communication, while excluding dialing and routing information. Electronic surveillance under FISA can be authorized for up to one year without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information. Section 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for up to one year to acquire foreign intelligence information upon certification by the Attorney General. The proposed amendment expands the application to include electronic surveillance directed at the contents of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The proposed amendment to Section 102 of FISA expands electronic surveillance to include communications of foreign powers or their agents, removing the requirement for the Attorney General to certify no substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communications. Compliance and reporting procedures remain in place. The proposed amendment to Section 102 of FISA expands electronic surveillance to include communications of foreign powers or their agents. The Attorney General must assess compliance with minimization procedures and report to congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must include justification for this belief. The Attorney General must also transmit certification to the FISC. The procedures for electronic surveillance under FISA require a statement of facts to justify targeting a foreign power's agent. The Attorney General must transmit certification to the FISC under seal, and may direct a common carrier to assist in surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA creates new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA, Sec. 9(c) of S. 3931, Sec. 209(c) of S. 3929, authorizes the President, through the Attorney General, to acquire foreign intelligence information for up to one year regarding a person believed to be outside the US. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA authorizes the acquisition of foreign intelligence information by the President through the Attorney General. This includes access to wire or electronic communications by individuals with relevant roles, with a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information. Compliance with certification and minimization procedures is required, with reporting to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures are required for the acquisition of foreign intelligence information, without the need to specify the exact locations. The Attorney General must report assessments to congressional intelligence committees, and a copy of the certification is sent to the FISC. Assistance is authorized to protect secrecy and minimize interference with the acquisition. The proposed subsection 102(o) of FISA allows for acquisition with the Attorney General's authorization. The specified person must provide necessary assistance while maintaining secrecy. Compensation at prevailing rates is required, and non-compliance can lead to FISC intervention. The proposed changes to FISA would require the government to compensate individuals providing aid at prevailing rates. Non-compliance with the Attorney General's directive could result in FISC intervention and contempt of court. Individuals receiving a directive have the right to challenge its legality through a petition to the FISC review pool. Individuals receiving a directive have the right to challenge its legality by filing a petition with the FISC review pool. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours and make a determination within 72 hours. A petition to modify or set aside a directive can only be granted if it does not meet legal requirements. Individuals receiving a directive can challenge its legality by filing a petition with the FISC review pool. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours and make a determination within 72 hours. A petition to modify or set aside a directive can only be granted if it does not meet legal requirements. If the judge does not modify or set aside the directive, immediate compliance is ordered. Review of FISC decisions can be sought within seven days, with the FIS Court of Review providing a written statement of reasons for its decision. Further review can be pursued with the U.S. Supreme Court. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision within seven days of the issuance of the FISC decision. Review can be sought with the U.S. Supreme Court, and all proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and maintained under security measures. The record of proceedings under FISA must be maintained securely. Petitions are filed under seal, and in camera review of classified information may be conducted. No cause of action can be taken against providers for assisting the Government under FISA directives. Proposed subsections of FISA would prevent any legal action against communication service providers for providing information to the Government under directives. Information acquired under Attorney General authorization can be used by federal officers with minimization procedures. Information can only be used for lawful purposes. Proposed subsection 102 of FISA outlines the procedures for the use and disclosure of information acquired by federal officers with minimization procedures. Information can only be used for lawful purposes and cannot be disclosed for law enforcement purposes without the advance authorization of the Attorney General. Additionally, privileged communications obtained under Section 102 will not lose their privileged status. New subsection 102(k) of FISA states that privileged communications obtained under Section 102 will not lose their privileged status. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) provide procedures for using or disclosing such information in federal or state proceedings. The federal government can only introduce or use information acquired under Section 102 in court proceedings if it complies with the requirements of subsection 102(m). The acquisition under Section 102 of FISA can be used in court proceedings if it complies with proposed subsections 102(m) and (n), which outline procedures for notifying the aggrieved person and the court before using the information. Under proposed subsection 102(n) of FISA, a state or political subdivision must notify the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using or disclosing information obtained from a Section 102 acquisition in any legal proceeding. The aggrieved person can move to suppress the evidence if it was unlawfully acquired. The U.S. Attorney General must be notified by a state or political subdivision before using or disclosing information obtained from a Section 102 acquisition in a legal proceeding. An aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence if it was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an authorization order. Proposed subsections 102(o) and 102(p) of FISA allow for the filing of a motion to suppress evidence related to national security concerns. The U.S. district court is responsible for handling such motions or requests in legal proceedings. The U.S. district court has the authority to determine the lawfulness of Section 102 acquisitions and may review related materials in camera and ex parte. Portions of the materials may be disclosed to the aggrieved person if necessary for an accurate determination. The U.S. district court can review the Attorney General's directive and related materials in camera and ex parte for Section 102 acquisitions. Disclosure to the aggrieved person is allowed if necessary for legality determination. If the acquisition is found lawful, the aggrieved person's motion may be denied, with exceptions for due process requirements. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel for coordinating efforts in investigating or protecting. Court decisions on lawfulness of Section 102 acquisitions are binding on all federal and state courts except for U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel to coordinate efforts in investigating or protecting against various threats. Coordination does not replace required certifications under subsections 102(a) or (b). Proposed subsection 102(u) of FISA mandates that directives and orders under Section 102 must be retained for 10 years. Additionally, amendments to FISA allow the Chief Justice to designate district court judges as FISC judges, with specific residency requirements. A new subsection 103(g) provides authority for FISC orders under Title I of FISA if authorized by the President. The United States will designate 11 district court judges as FISC judges, with residency requirements near Washington D.C. New authority is granted for FISC orders under Title I of FISA if approved by the President. Amendments to FISA include changes to Section 104, allowing for court orders to authorize electronic surveillance. The amendments to FISA include changes to Section 104, requiring certification for court orders to authorize electronic surveillance under FISA. The certification would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an appointed executive branch official. The certification for court orders to authorize electronic surveillance under FISA would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an executive branch official designated by the President. The curr_chunk discusses the exclusion of certain information from an application for a FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance when the target is a foreign power. It mentions the required statement about physical entry, surveillance techniques, and information about U.S. persons. It also proposes changes to current subsections of FISA. The curr_chunk proposes amendments to FISA, including expanding the list of officials who can request a review of surveillance applications and making changes to Section 105 of FISA. The curr_chunk proposes amendments to FISA, including expanding the list of officials who can request a review of surveillance applications and making changes to Section 105 of FISA to streamline the approval process. The proposed amendments to FISA aim to streamline the approval process for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence information by removing certain subsections and redesignating others. The proposed amendments to FISA aim to streamline the approval process for electronic surveillance by deleting and replacing subsections, including specifying the authorized coverage of surveillance devices and minimization procedures. Current subsection 105(d) of FISA deals with excluding certain information from applications for court orders authorizing electronic surveillance on foreign powers. It requires specifying the type of surveillance, the communications to be monitored, and whether physical entry is needed. Proposed amendments would replace the language with a requirement to specify the type of surveillance, including the need for physical entry. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted on the same basis as the original order under Section 105(e)(2). Proposed changes to FISA would require specifying the type of electronic surveillance in each order, including the need for physical entry. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted on the same basis as the original order, with exceptions for certain targeted surveillance. The proposed changes to FISA would allow for extensions of surveillance orders on the same basis as the original order, with exceptions for certain targeted surveillance against foreign powers or individuals engaged in international terrorism. The proposed changes to FISA would allow for extensions of surveillance orders on the same basis as the original order, with exceptions for certain targeted surveillance against foreign powers or individuals engaged in international terrorism. An agent of a foreign power who is not a United States person may be granted extensions of an order under Title I of FISA for a period not to exceed one year, with emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours in certain situations. 105(f), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(f), allows emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General in cases of urgent need for foreign intelligence information. Surveillance must be terminated when the information is obtained, if a court order is denied, or after 72 hours. Notification to a FISC judge is required during the emergency surveillance period. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA allows emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General. The surveillance must be terminated when the information is obtained, if a court order is denied, or after 72 hours. The new language would grant such authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA allows emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General. The new language would grant such authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The new law would require informing the Attorney General of emergency electronic surveillance and notifying a FISC judge promptly after authorization. The new law would require informing a FISC judge promptly after authorization of emergency electronic surveillance. An application must be made to the FISC judge within seven days after the surveillance is authorized. Surveillance shall terminate when the information is obtained or when the application for the order is denied. Under the new provision, an application must be made to a FISC judge within seven days after surveillance is authorized. The 72-hour limit for emergency electronic surveillance approval by the Attorney General would be replaced by a seven-day limit approved by an executive branch officer appointed by the President. The emergency electronic surveillance approval process would be changed to require an application to a FISC judge within seven days. The executive branch officer appointed by the President would authorize the surveillance, with restrictions on disclosure and use of information. Minimization procedures for court orders would be followed in emergency surveillance situations. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA would require minimization procedures for emergency electronic surveillance. It would also modify limitations of liability for those providing assistance with FISA surveillance or searches. No cause of action would lie against providers who comply with court orders or emergency requests. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires minimization procedures for emergency electronic surveillance and modifies limitations of liability for providers assisting with FISA surveillance or searches. No cause of action would lie against providers who comply with court orders or emergency requests. Additionally, Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons acquired from electronic surveillance and includes notification requirements for aggrieved persons. Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons acquired from electronic surveillance and includes notification requirements for aggrieved persons. It also provides an opportunity for an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information in an official proceeding. Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons acquired from electronic surveillance and includes notification requirements for aggrieved persons. Under Sec. 9(g) of S. 3931, Sec. 209(g) of S. 3929, and Sec. 106(i) of FISA, provisions would be modified to require the destruction of unintentionally acquired communications if both sender and recipients are in the U.S., unless there is a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The Attorney General determines a threat of death or serious bodily harm from contents. Amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA is unclear. Language amendment proposes insertion of \"contain significant foreign intelligence information or\" after certain phrases. The language amendment proposes inserting \"contain significant foreign intelligence information or\" in certain circumstances involving unintentional acquisition of communication contents. This would allow the Attorney General to determine if the contents pose a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The proposed language amendment allows the Attorney General to determine if unintentionally acquired communication contents contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of death or serious bodily harm. This expands the circumstances for when such contents can be retained, with a potential redundancy in the wording. The proposed amendment allows the Attorney General to determine if unintentionally acquired communication contents contain foreign intelligence information. Amendments to FISA include changes to subsections and oversight provisions for secure document management. The proposed amendment allows the Attorney General to determine if unintentionally acquired communication contents contain foreign intelligence information. In consultation with key agencies, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop a secure document management system for prompt preparation and review of FISC orders authorizing electronic surveillance. Amendments to FISA aim to streamline the process and enhance oversight provisions. The proposed amendments to FISA include electronic filings to the FISC and changes to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include those involved in weapons of mass destruction. The proposed amendments to FISA include electronic filings to the FISC and changes to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to encompass individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction and terrorism activities. The proposed amendments to FISA expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction and terrorism activities, as outlined in subsection 101(b)(2)(C) of FISA. The proposed amendments to FISA would classify \"power\" as an \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA, expanding the definition to include individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction. This new subsection defines \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices, weapons involving biological agents or toxins, and weapons designed to release radiation. The proposed amendments to FISA expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction. This includes the release of toxic chemicals, biological weapons, and weapons designed to release radiation at dangerous levels. Amendments also address the duration and extension of FISC orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches related to international movements of targets. The proposed amendments to FISA include expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to cover individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction, such as toxic chemicals, biological weapons, and radiation-emitting weapons. The amendments also address the duration and extension of FISC orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches related to international movements of targets. New subsections would be added to FISA to ensure that orders remain in force even if the target is outside the United States, unless the government files a motion to terminate the order and the court approves it. The court grants a motion to extinguish the order under a new subsection 304(d)(4) of FISA. Amendments to FISA include replacing Section 102, repealing wartime authorities, and creating a new Title VII."
