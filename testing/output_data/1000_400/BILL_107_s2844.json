    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children (I Teach) Act of 2002\". Congress finds that there is a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade. The No Child Left Behind Act requires States to recruit qualified teachers by 2006, especially in rural and high-poverty schools. Rural education is crucial in 25 States, and high poverty schools often lack certified teachers in their fields. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, established in 1987, sets high standards for accomplished teachers. High poverty schools face challenges in recruiting certified teachers, impacting their ability to meet education goals. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, established in 1987, certifies teachers based on rigorous assessments. Recent data shows that certified teachers outperform their peers on key measures of teaching expertise. Recent data from the Accomplished Teaching Validation Study shows that National Board certified teachers outperform non-certified teachers on 11 out of 13 key measures of teaching expertise. Teacher salaries have remained stagnant over the past decade, with two-thirds of states not meeting the national average of $40,582. The purposes of the Act include encouraging teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through a refundable tax credit and providing an additional tax credit for National Board certification.
