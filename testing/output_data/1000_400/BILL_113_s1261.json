    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop an implementation strategy within one year of enactment. The Federal agencies must work with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to create a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. This strategy should be based on the agency's specific operating requirements and statutory mission, considering advanced metering infrastructure and related practices. In developing an implementation strategy, each Federal agency must consider information and communications technologies (ICT) and related infrastructure, including advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services and products, efficient data center strategies, power management, building information modeling, and secure telework tools. The Federal agencies must consider ICT and related infrastructure, building information modeling, and secure telework tools in their implementation strategy to improve energy efficiency. Performance goals for evaluating these efforts must be established within 180 days of the enactment of this subsection. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient ICT systems. This includes specifications and benchmarks for data center operators to make informed decisions on energy efficiency and cost savings. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient ICT systems, including specifications and benchmarks for data center operators to make informed decisions on energy efficiency, cost savings, asset utilization, and best practices for achieving benchmarks. The performance goals set for Federal agencies include measuring IT costs over 3 to 5 years and tracking cost savings from energy-efficient ICT solutions. Recommendations will promote energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting as preferred acquisition methods. The Federal Data Centers Task Force, comprised of program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers, is tasked with maintaining a complete picture of costs and savings, including energy costs and savings, over a 3 to 5-year period. The Director maintains a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force with Federal program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The task force shares progress towards agency and Federal energy efficiency goals, exchanges best practices with the private sector, and requires agency reports on energy efficiency. The Federal agencies are required to regularly exchange best practices and strategic information on energy efficiency with the private sector. Agency reports must include efforts and results related to this requirement, and the Director must include this information in the annual report and scorecard starting from October 1, 2013. Starting from October 1, 2013, Federal agencies must report their efforts and results on energy efficiency to the Director, who will include this information in the annual report and scorecard. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization for a program and conduct a study by December 31, 2013. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an IT industry organization for a program and conduct a study by December 31, 2013, updating a report on server and data center energy efficiency. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an IT industry organization for a program and conduct a study by December 31, 2013, updating a report on server and data center energy efficiency. The report provides a comparison and gap analysis of estimates and projections from 2007 to 2012, an analysis of information and communications technologies impact, and updated projections and recommendations for best practices. The Secretary collaborates with the designated organization in preparing the report. Additionally, there is a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program established. The Secretary, in collaboration with the designated organization and the Federal Chief Information Officer, maintains a data center energy practitioner program for certifying qualified individuals to evaluate energy usage and efficiency in data centers. Federal agencies are required to have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners employed by the agency. The Secretary, in collaboration with the designated organization and the Federal Chief Information Officer, establishes an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. The Chief Information Officer establishes an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while protecting national security interests. The Secretary collaborates to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency and develop an efficiency metric. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations, works on harmonizing global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, including developing an efficiency metric for overall data center energy efficiency."
