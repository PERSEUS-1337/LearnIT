To address the challenge of generalizing to new domains without annotations, a domain adaptation method is proposed. This method involves learning discriminative feature representations of patches based on label histograms in the source domain and using an adversarial learning scheme to align feature distributions between source and target patches. The framework also includes a global alignment process, leading to state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation. The text discusses a domain adaptation method for semantic segmentation, focusing on learning discriminative feature representations of patches and aligning feature distributions between source and target patches using an adversarial learning scheme. The framework includes a global alignment process and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between annotated training data and unlabelled test domains for vision tasks like object recognition and semantic segmentation. While progress has been made in image classification, there is still room for improvement in pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Annotating ground truth for such tasks is costly, making domain adaptation crucial for accurate predictions in varying visual conditions. Domain adaptation is essential for pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation due to the high cost of annotating ground truth data. Existing methods use feature-level or output space adaptation to align distributions between source and target domains using adversarial learning. However, global distribution alignment may not be sufficient as differences in camera pose or field of view can lead to significant variations between domains. In domain adaptation for pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation, global distribution alignment may not be effective due to differences in camera pose or field of view. Instead of aligning global statistics, the focus is on matching patches that are more likely to be shared across domains. This is achieved through adversarial learning to align patch-level distributions, inspired by recent advances in learning disentangled representations. To align patch-level distributions in domain adaptation for pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation, a method inspired by learning disentangled representations is used. Discriminative representations for patches are learned to address high variation among them, with a focus on matching shared patches across domains. This approach aims to better align patches by considering label histograms and spatial relationships between grids. In domain adaptation for pixel-level prediction tasks like semantic segmentation, discriminative representations for source patches are learned to address high variation among them. Two adversarial modules are used to align global and patch-level distributions between domains, with a focus on matching shared patches. The learning process involves using pixel-level annotations in the source domain and applying K-means clustering to group patch representations into clusters. The proposed space adaptation BID31 aligns patch-based representations by learning discriminative features using pixel-level annotations in the source domain. K-means clustering groups patch representations into clusters for training a shared classifier across domains. An adversarial loss is used to minimize the domain gap and push target patches' features closer to the distribution of the source patches in the clustered space.

The discussion includes domain adaptation methods for image classification and pixel-level prediction tasks, as well as algorithms for learning disentangled representations. Domain adaptation methods for image classification and pixel-level prediction tasks involve aligning feature distributions between source and target domains. Conventional approaches minimize domain discrepancies using hand-crafted features, while recent algorithms utilize deep architectures to learn domain-invariant features. Adversarial learning schemes and Maximum Mean Discrepancy are commonly used to enhance feature representations. Other methods focus on pixel-level transfer for improved performance. Deep architectures are used for domain adaptation, with adversarial learning and Maximum Mean Discrepancy being common practices. Variants involve different classifiers and loss functions. Recent work focuses on pixel-level transfer and domain separation. Domain adaptation for structured pixel-level predictions is less studied compared to image classification. Prior work on semantic segmentation for road-scene images uses adversarial networks to align global feature representations and transfer category-specific priors from the source domain to the target distribution. The CDA method BID36 applies SVM classifier to capture label distributions on superpixels for training the adapted model on the target domain. Class-wise domain adversarial alignment is performed by assigning pseudo labels to target data, with object priors extracted from Google Street View to aid alignment for static objects. These domain adaptation methods focus on structured output. Our proposed method focuses on learning discriminative representations for patches to aid in patch-level alignment during domain adaptation. Unlike existing methods that use global distribution alignment and class-specific priors, our framework does not require additional annotations and enables end-to-end training. Compared to other output space adaptation methods, our algorithm offers improved patch-level alignment without sacrificing structured information preservation.

This step combines supervised and adversarial loss functions to enhance feature representations in G. The adversarial loss functions FORMULA1 and FORMULA4 are combined with binary cross-entropy loss functions to update the Discriminator Dg and Network G. The Discriminator Dg uses fully-convolutional layers with 5 convolution layers and a leaky ReLU activation. The Discriminator Dl utilizes 3 fully-connected layers for input data as a K-dimensional vector.
