    "content": "The \"Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013\" extends the interest rate deadline to July 1, 2014. It also includes modifications to required distribution rules for pension plans. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to require distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death for a trust to be qualified, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries. The distribution of an employee's interest must occur within 5 years of their death for a trust to be qualified, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries who can receive distributions over their lifetime. If an eligible designated beneficiary can receive distributions over their lifetime, the distribution of an employee's interest must occur within 5 years of their death for a trust to be qualified. The distribution of an employee's interest must occur within 1 year of the employee's death, or a later date set by the Secretary, for certain purposes, unless exceptions apply. If the surviving spouse is the eligible designated beneficiary, special rules apply. Special rules apply for the surviving spouse of an employee as the eligible designated beneficiary. Distributions must begin no earlier than when the employee would have turned 70 1/2, and if the spouse dies before receiving distributions, the rules apply as if the spouse were alive. The rules for distributions to a surviving spouse as the eligible designated beneficiary state that distributions must start when the employee would have turned 70 1/2. If the spouse dies before receiving distributions, the rules apply as if the spouse were still alive. If the eligible designated beneficiary dies before the employee's interest is fully distributed, different rules apply to the remaining portion. The definition of an eligible designated beneficiary under the Internal Revenue Code is any individual designated by the employee as a beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies before the employee's interest is fully distributed, different rules apply to the remaining portion. The term 'designated beneficiary' refers to an individual chosen by the employee, while an 'eligible designated beneficiary' is a designated beneficiary who is the employee's surviving spouse or a minor child. The eligible designated beneficiary can be the surviving spouse, a child under the age of majority, a disabled individual, or a chronically ill person. The requirements for an eligible designated beneficiary include a certification of an indefinite period of inability, or an individual not more than 10 years younger than the employee. A special rule applies for children in this context. The special rule for children states that an individual described in the context of being not more than 10 years younger than the employee will cease to be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority age. The requirement of distribution within 5 years after reaching majority age is emphasized. The amendment in Section 401(a)(9)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 states that if an employee becomes a 5-percent owner after age 70 1/2, then certain distribution rules apply. The amendment in Section 401(a)(9)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies to employees who become a 5-percent owner after age 70 1/2, affecting distribution rules for employees who die after December 31, 2013. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions for employees who die after December 31, 2013, and to employees becoming a 5-percent owner with respect to plan years ending in calendar years beginning before, on, or after the enactment of this Act. If an employee became a 5-percent owner before 2013 and has not retired by 2014, they will be treated as a 5-percent owner for 2013. Certain beneficiaries of employees who die before 2014 are exempt from the amendments made by this section. Certain beneficiaries of employees who die before January 1, 2014, are exempt from the amendments made by this section. If the designated beneficiary dies after December 31, 2013, the amendments will apply to any beneficiary of the designated beneficiary. The designated beneficiary will be treated as an eligible designated beneficiary for certain purposes. The amendments made by this section do not apply to certain existing annuity contracts. The amendments made by this section do not apply to qualified annuity contracts that were in effect before the enactment of this Act. A qualified annuity is defined as a commercial annuity or one payable by a defined benefit plan, with annuity payments. The term \"qualified annuity\" refers to an annuity that is a commercial annuity or payable by a defined benefit plan, with substantially equal periodic payments over the lives of the employee and a designated beneficiary. The term \"qualified annuity\" refers to an annuity that provides periodic payments over the lives of the employee and a designated beneficiary, meeting specific regulations outlined in section 401(a)(9) of the Code. An irrevocable election must be made by the employee before January 1, 2014, for annuity payments to begin. The qualified annuity requires an irrevocable election by the employee before specific dates for annuity payments to begin. The employee must make an irrevocable election before specific dates for annuity payments to begin."
