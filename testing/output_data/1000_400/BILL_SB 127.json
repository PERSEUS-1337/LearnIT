    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, there is no similar aid for individual homeowners with groundwater wells. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment, including digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, and connecting to local systems. Chapter 6.6 is added to the Water Code to establish a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program. Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code establishes a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program to provide low-interest loans and grants for various purposes such as extending service lines, connecting to water systems, closing abandoned septic tanks, deepening groundwater wells, and improving existing wells. The Water Code's Chapter 6.6 establishes a program for low-interest loans and grants for water and wastewater projects, including connecting to systems, closing abandoned septic tanks, deepening wells, and installing treatment systems for contaminated groundwater. The board has the authority to adopt regulations to support the program's goals. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is created in the State Treasury for water and wastewater projects. The board can adopt regulations to support the program's goals, and the fund includes moneys repaid from grants or loans, as well as interest earned. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund receives repayments from grants or loans, including interest earned. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median, own their residence, lack access to private financial assistance, and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. Loan applicants must have an ownership interest in their residence, be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders, demonstrate the ability to repay the loan, and secure the loan with a mortgage on the residence. The loan must be repaid within 20 years with an interest rate not exceeding 1 percent. Homeowner's insurance must be maintained on the residence while the loan is outstanding. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low income and ownership of their residence. Grant recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. The board provides loans to eligible low-income applicants who own their residence. Grant recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. Additionally, $10 million is transferred to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. This act is an urgency statute to improve access to clean water during California's drought. Section 21168.6.7 is added to the Public Resources Code. The act aims to provide eligible households with access to cleaner drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. It defines \"water project\" and establishes procedures for challenges to environmental impact reports or project approvals. The Judicial Council shall establish procedures for challenges to environmental impact reports or project approvals for water projects, aiming to resolve actions within 270 days of certification. The reports must include a notice in 12-point type. The draft and final environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in 12-point type stating that certain comments filed after the public comment period may not be considered. Judicial challenges to the certification of the report or project approval are subject to specific procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. The full text of this section must be included as an appendix in the reports. The draft and final environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice stating that certain comments filed after the public comment period may not be considered. Within 10 days of releasing the draft report, an informational workshop must be conducted, and a public hearing held within 10 days before the close of the comment period. A transcript of the hearing must be included in the final report. Within 10 days before the end of the public comment period, a public hearing must be held by the lead agency to receive testimony on the draft environmental impact report. A transcript of the hearing will be included in the final report. Within five days after the comment period closes, a commenter can request nonbinding mediation, which must be completed within 35 days. The mediation will involve the lead agency, applicant, and all commenters who requested it. The lead agency must select mediators with expertise in land use and environmental law or science for nonbinding mediation requested by commenters. The applicant covers the costs, and any agreed-upon measures become conditions of approval. Commenters agreeing to measures cannot challenge the agency's decision based on those issues. The lead agency does not have to consider late written comments unless they address new issues, new information released after the draft report, changes to the project, or proposed conditions for approval. The lead agency must file required notices within five days of project approval and prepare the record of proceedings, with costs covered by the applicant. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of release. Any additional documents prepared or submitted after the draft report must also be accessible within five business days. The lead agency is required to make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available in an electronic format within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be available electronically. The lead agency should encourage written comments in electronic format and make them accessible within five days of receipt. The lead agency must make draft environmental impact reports available electronically within three business days of release. Written comments on the project should be submitted in electronic format and made accessible to the public within five days. Comments not in electronic format will be converted and made available within seven business days. Comments not considered will be noted in the record without including their content. Within five days of filing the notice, the lead agency certifies the record of proceedings and provides an electronic copy to parties upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the court. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the court. Any disputes over the record content will be resolved by the superior court. The court can grant relief without staying or enjoining a water project unless there is an imminent threat to public health and safety. In an action brought under this division, the court can only stay or enjoin the construction of a water project if there is an imminent threat to public health or if important Native American artifacts or historical values would be adversely affected. The court can only enjoin specific activities of a water project if there is an imminent threat to public health or if important Native American artifacts or historical values would be adversely affected. Any challenge to a decision of the lead agency must follow Chapter 6 requirements. An action to challenge a decision of the lead agency granting a subsequent project approval must follow Chapter 6 requirements. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated services."
