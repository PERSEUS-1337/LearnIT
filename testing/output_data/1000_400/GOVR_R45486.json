    "content": "The child nutrition programs, overseen by the USDA-FNS, include the NSLP, SBP, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program. These programs provide meals and snacks to children in various institutional settings. The programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The child nutrition programs, including NSLP and SBP, were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Some authorities expired in 2015, but program operations continued with annual appropriations. Lawmakers in the 114th Congress began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers initiated child nutrition reauthorization but did not complete it. Reauthorization involves potentially changing permanent statutes like the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act. Legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) for reauthorization died at the end of the 114th Congress. There were no significant reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress, but the 2018 farm bill included some child nutrition-related provisions. The 114th Congress initiated child nutrition reauthorization efforts, but they did not complete it. Legislation for reauthorization died at the end of the Congress. In the 115th Congress, there were no significant reauthorization efforts, but the 2018 farm bill included some child nutrition-related provisions. The implementation of the HHFKA and issues raised during farm bill negotiations may be relevant for future reauthorization efforts or policymaking opportunities, particularly regarding the nutritional quality and sourcing of foods in schools. The report highlights key issues for Congress in future child nutrition reauthorization efforts, including the nutritional quality of foods, access to meals, and implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. This report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including concerns raised by Congress and stakeholders. It references CRS reports for more detailed information on specific issues and legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. The child nutrition programs, including school meals, must meet specific requirements for federal reimbursement, such as nutritional standards. These standards were updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), which also mandated new nutrition standards for competitive foods. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) updated nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, with increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements. Various organizations and stakeholders supported the nutritional requirements, including nutrition advocacy groups, food companies, and then-First Lady Michelle Obama. The nutrition standards in the HHFKA were supported by various organizations and stakeholders, including nutrition advocacy groups, food companies, and Michelle Obama. The final rules for school meals and competitive foods were published by USDA-FNS in 2012 and 2016, based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations. The updated standards increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and imposed limits on calories, sodium, and whole grains. The nutrition standards in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act were updated in 2012 and 2016 based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations. The standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school meals, limited calories, sodium, and fats, and restricted milk to low-fat options. Competitive foods also had limits on calories, sodium, and fats, with exceptions for fundraisers. The nutrition standards in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act updated in 2012 and 2016 increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school meals, limited calories, sodium, and fats. Competitive foods also had limits on calories, sodium, and fats, with exceptions for fundraisers. Implementation challenges included difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. In the first two years of implementing updated nutrition standards, schools faced challenges with obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance of foods, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) and government studies confirmed these issues. SNA advocated for changes to the standards, while others argued for maintaining them for children's health. In January 2014, USDA removed weekly limits on grains and protein. In SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014, the first two years of implementation, there were challenges with obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance of foods, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. SNA advocated for changes to the standards, while others argued for maintaining them for children's health. In January 2014, USDA removed weekly limits on grains and protein. Congress enacted provisions that loosened the milk, whole grain, and/or sodium requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. USDA implemented similar changes for SY2018-2019 in an interim final rule. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule that indefinitely changes these three aspects of the standards starting in SY2019-2020. Specifically, the rule allows all SFAs to offer flavored, low-fat (1%) milk as part of school meals and as beverages sold in schools, and requires unflavored milk to be offered alongside flavored milk in school meals; requires SFAs to. The USDA published a final rule in December 2018 that made changes to school meal standards starting in SY2019-2020. The rule allows flavored, low-fat milk to be offered, requires unflavored milk to be offered alongside flavored milk, mandates a 50% whole grain-rich requirement, allows exemptions for nonwhole grain-rich products, maintains Target 1 sodium limits until SY2023-2024, implements Target 2 limits from SY2024-2025, and eliminates Target 3 limits. The USDA published a final rule in December 2018 that made changes to school meal standards, including allowing flavored, low-fat milk, maintaining Target 1 sodium limits until SY2023-2024, implementing Target 2 limits from SY2024-2025, and eliminating Target 3 limits. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, including requirements for USDA to review and revise the standards based on research for school-age children, without adding extra costs, and maintaining healthy meals for students. This provision was not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress also sought to alter the nutrition standards, with the House committee's proposal requiring USDA to review school meal standards at least once every three years. The House committee's proposal (H.R. 5003) in the 114th Congress would have required USDA to review school meal standards every three years and revise them as needed. Fundraisers by student groups would no longer need to meet competitive food standards, and foods served as part of a federally reimbursable meal could be sold a la carte. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) would have required USDA to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) aimed to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals, reducing the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delaying the Target 2 sodium requirement for two years. Additionally, there were discussions about allowing frozen, dried, canned, and other types of fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, instead of only fresh products. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project that included canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. Stakeholders have debated whether to include non-fresh options in the program, with 56% of pilot schools opting to incorporate these alternatives. The USDA conducted a pilot project in Alaska, Delaware, Kansas, and Maine to address challenges in obtaining, storing, and preparing fresh fruits and vegetables for schools. 56% of pilot schools introduced canned and dried fruits, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings in the FFVP. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student satisfaction slightly decreased, parents had mixed responses, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days, likely due to students consuming smaller quantities of dried or canned fruit. Student participation was not significantly impacted. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased during the pilot, while parents' responses were mixed. School administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals have been considered to allow CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in FFVP, removing \"fresh\" from the program name. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools to serve all forms of fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), including tree nuts. The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited access to fresh produce, allowing them to serve canned or dried fruits and vegetables. Schools in the National School Lunch Program must comply with federal requirements for domestically sourced foods. Schools in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and/or School Breakfast Program (SBP) must transition to 100% fresh products over time and comply with federal requirements for domestically sourced foods. Buy American requirements mandate purchasing domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable, defined as those produced and processed substantially in the United States. The Buy American requirements mandate purchasing domestic commodities or products that are produced and processed substantially in the United States. USDA has issued guidance on implementing these requirements, including defining \"processed substantially\" as containing over 51% domestically grown ingredients. The guidance applies to foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. The USDA-FNS guidance from a June 2017 memorandum outlines Buy American requirements for foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. Schools are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes by monitoring the USDA catalog for products and including Buy American language in procurement documents. Exceptions to the Buy American requirements are allowed on a limited basis for products not produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities or when the cost of a U.S. product is significantly higher than a non-domestic product. SFAs are allowed to make exceptions to Buy American requirements when a product is not produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities or when the cost of a U.S. product is significantly higher than a non-domestic product. SFAs must interpret and document any exceptions made, and state agencies must review compliance and take corrective action when necessary. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce full compliance with Buy American requirements within 180 days of enactment. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce full compliance with Buy American requirements within 180 days of enactment, clarifying the definition of domestic products for enforcement purposes. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements within 180 days, clarifying the definition of domestic products for enforcement purposes. Proponents argue for stricter requirements due to economic and food safety reasons, expressing concern over sourcing from China. Maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement is also debated, citing the availability and cost-effectiveness of high-quality domestic options. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings under current law. Some policymakers advocate for stricter Buy American requirements for domestic sourcing, especially concerning China. There is a debate over maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement, citing availability and cost-effectiveness. Summer meals are usually provided in group settings through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. Policymakers are exploring alternatives to congregate meals, particularly in rural areas where onsite consumption may be challenging. Some alternatives to congregate meals in SFSP and SSO focus on rural areas, which face challenges in reaching children. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project, funded by the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act, provides electronic food benefits to eligible households during the summer months. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC or Summer EBT) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals during the summer months. Participants receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP, with different redemption options based on the program. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC or Summer EBT) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals during the summer months. Participants can redeem benefits for SNAP-eligible foods at any SNAP-authorized retailer or WIC-eligible foods at WIC-authorized retailers. An evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a decrease in very low food security and improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains among participants. Funding for Summer EBT projects has been provided by Congress, with increased consumption seen at sites operating the WIC model. The Summer EBT project has shown improvements in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Funding for Summer EBT projects has been provided by Congress, with recent funding of $28 million for the Summer EBT demonstration in FY2019. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included various states and tribal nations. USDA announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states and statewide projects. In FY2019, USDA announced a new strategy for Summer EBT grant recipients, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating from 2019 to 2021. There were proposals in Congress to expand Summer EBT, including allowing SFSP funding to cover Summer EBT and recommending nationwide expansion over 10 years. In the 114th Congress, a proposal (S. 3136) aimed to use SFSP funding for Summer EBT and allocate up to $50 million in discretionary funding. The Obama Administration also proposed nationwide expansion of Summer EBT over 10 years. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded other projects like the eSFSP, which included initiatives to extend SFSP operations, add activities at meal sites, provide meal delivery in rural areas, and distribute food backpacks to children. The eSFSP program ran from 2010 to 2012 in eight states, with initiatives to extend SFSP operations, add activities at meal sites, provide meal delivery in rural areas, and distribute food backpacks to children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity rates for children in the meal delivery and backpack initiatives. However, results should be interpreted cautiously due to small sample size and lack of comparison group. The eSFSP program from 2010 to 2012 included initiatives like meal delivery, backpack distributions, and extending SFSP operations. Evaluations showed increased participation rates and consistent food insecurity for children in these initiatives. Another project provided exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for outdoor meal sites during excessive heat since 2015. USDA offers exemptions for extreme weather conditions on a case-by-case basis. The USDA offers exemptions for extreme weather conditions on a case-by-case basis for congregate feeding in the SFSP program. In the 114th Congress, there were proposals to allow rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption in certain areas. In the 114th Congress, proposals were made to allow rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption in specific areas, including rural and nonrural areas with high percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The bills would have also allowed congregate feeding sites to provide meals for offsite consumption under certain conditions. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to offer free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) offers free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation has increased since its nationwide availability in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. CEP has been praised for improving meal access, reducing stigma, and lowering administrative costs. Some have sought changes to the option, such as restrictions proposed in the 114th Congress. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) offers free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation has increased since its nationwide availability in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. CEP improves access to meals, reduces stigma associated with receiving free or reduced-price meals, and reduces schools' administrative costs. In the 114th Congress, proposed restrictions on CEP aimed to better target resources to students in need. However, CEP has created data issues for other non-nutrition federal and state programs, such as the federal Title I-A program. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) has created data issues for federal and state programs like the Title I-A program. Schools may serve students meals and create debts for unpaid costs, leading to increased attention on this issue. In recent years, schools have faced the issue of students not paying for their meals, leading to increased attention on the topic. Some schools respond by charging unpaid meal costs and creating a debt, while others practice \"lunch shaming\" by taking away hot meals or implementing other punitive measures. Instances of lunch shaming have been reported in various states, with limited national data available on the prevalence of such practices. Many schools respond to unpaid meal costs by implementing punitive measures such as restricting children from school events or using visual indicators of debt. Limited national data is available on the prevalence of lunch shaming instances, which have been reported in various states. Unpaid meal costs create financial burdens for school meal programs, as federal funds and student payments are crucial revenue sources. If schools cannot recover unpaid meal funds, they must cover the costs with nonfederal funding sources. Schools rely on revenue from school meal programs, and unpaid meal costs can lead to financial burdens. If schools cannot recover these funds, they must use nonfederal funding sources to cover the costs. Congress and USDA have taken steps to address the issue, including examining policies and practices regarding unpaid meal charges and considering national standards for meal charges. The USDA was required by law to prepare a report on national standards for meal charges and alternate meals. The report recommended updating policy guidance and distributing best practices instead of implementing national standards. SFAs were required to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017. USDA-FNS required SFAs to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, and provided guidance through webinars and a best practice guide. Findings from a study and Request for Information showed meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school level. The study and Request for Information (RFI) on \"Unpaid Meal Charges\" by USDA-FNS in October 2014 revealed that meal charge policies were primarily set at the school and district levels, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. Responses to the RFI showed a preference for local control of policies by school and district officials, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress, with provisions in the FY2018 appropriations law aimed at preventing discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. In the 115th Congress, national advocacy groups supported national standards for school meal policies. Legislation such as the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 aimed to establish guidelines for how schools handle children unable to pay for meals. States have also addressed unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming through legislation, like Illinois in 2018. The Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 (H.R. 2401/S. 1064) aimed to set national standards for how schools treat students unable to pay for meals. States like Illinois have also passed laws addressing unpaid meal costs, such as requiring schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced new requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches, including gradually increasing prices if needed and allowing for nonfederal funding to meet the requirements. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced new requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches to ensure children receiving free and reduced-price lunches receive the full value of federal funds. Prior to these requirements, federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Under the paid lunch equity requirements, federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Schools must increase prices over time until the price per paid lunch matches or exceeds the federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. For example, in SY2018-2019, the federal reimbursement was $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches. If schools were not charging at least $3.00 per paid lunch, they would need to raise prices. The federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches must be matched by schools over time. For example, in SY2018-2019, the reimbursement was $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches. Schools must gradually increase the price of paid lunches until they close the gap, with a maximum annual increase of 10 cents. The law also requires revenue from competitive foods to go to the school food authority. The HHFKA included requirements for revenue from competitive foods to accrue to the SFA-run NSFSA, preventing it from being used for other school purposes. USDA provided exemptions for SFAs in strong financial standing for SY2013-2014 through SY2017-2018. The FY2018 appropriation expanded exemptions for SY2018-2019. Starting in SY2011-2012, USDA provided exemptions for SFAs in strong financial standing for SY2013-2014 through SY2017-2018. The FY2018 appropriation expanded exemptions for SY2018-2019, potentially requiring SFAs with a negative balance in the NSFSA to raise prices for paid meals. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses aimed to eliminate or replace paid lunch equity requirements. In the 114th Congress, proposals were made to eliminate or replace paid lunch equity requirements in child nutrition programs. The House committee's proposal aimed to eliminate the requirements, while the Senate committee's proposal suggested replacing them with a broader \"non-federal revenue target.\""
