    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President fast track authority to consider trade agreement implementing legislation expeditiously and vote on it without amendment, provided certain negotiating objectives and consultation requirements are met. TPA aims to balance Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy while giving the President negotiating leverage. Earlier versions of TPA were adopted with bipartisan support, but as trade negotiations have become more complex, Congress has tightened requirements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President fast track authority for trade agreements, ensuring timely consideration by Congress. TPA has evolved over time with tighter oversight and consultation requirements, leading to more partisan debates on its renewal. The expiration of TPA raises questions on its future form and renewal, reflecting decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is the result of decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch. It reflects the constitutional powers of Congress and the President, emphasizing the need for cooperative flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The partnership between Congress and the executive branch on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained based on evolving political and economic conditions. Congress has explicit authority over regulating foreign trade, while the President plays a key role in negotiating reciprocal trade agreements. The U.S. Constitution assigns authority over foreign trade to Congress and the President. Congress regulates commerce and sets tariff rates, while the President negotiates treaties and agreements. Both branches play a role in developing and executing trade agreements. The development and execution of U.S. trade agreements involve both legislative and executive authorities. Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products for the first 150 years of the United States, while the President's role was to negotiate and implement bilateral treaties. Congressional trade debates often revolved around protectionist tariffs favored by northern manufacturing regions versus low tariffs advocated by southern commodity exporting regions. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act drastically changed U.S. trade policy by imposing high tariff rates in response to the Great Depression. This led to retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, severely restricting trade and worsening the economic downturn. The Tariff Act of 1930 set high tariff rates during the Great Depression, leading to retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions. In response, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 was enacted, allowing the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements. This act was significant as it authorized tariff reductions without additional legislation. The RTAA of 1934 authorized the President to enter reciprocal trade agreements reducing tariffs within pre-approved levels on an MFN basis. Congress delegated expanded trade authority to the President to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation, now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress delegated tariff-cutting authority to the President to reduce political pressure from special interests. Tariff levels declined, reducing their significance as a trade barrier. Congress renewed presidential trade agreements authority for tariff reductions 11 times until 1962. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress granted the President authority for five years to enter into agreements that negotiated the reduction or elimination of tariffs. This act also expanded Congress's role in the negotiating process by requiring the President to submit each concluded agreement for congressional review. In 1962, Congress granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reduction agreements for five years. The act expanded Congress's role by requiring the President to submit agreements for review. The GATT Kennedy Round focused on tariff reduction and also addressed nontariff barriers. The GATT member countries reached agreements in the Kennedy Round related to nontariff barriers (NTBs), including a customs valuation agreement and an antidumping agreement. Congress believed the President exceeded his authority by negotiating these agreements, leading to a resolution in 1966 against \"nontariff commitments.\" Changes in U.S. law or regulations, beyond tariff modifications, led Congress to believe the President had overstepped his authority. In 1966, Congress passed a resolution against \"nontariff commitments,\" which the Johnson Administration ignored. This dispute eventually led to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. The Kennedy Round highlighted the increasing importance of nontariff barrier rules in future trade agreements, requiring changes in U.S. law. Concerns over presidential encroachment on legislative authority prompted Congress to seek a legislative remedy. The tariff modification authority expired in 1967, but Congress did not renew it for seven years. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 expired in 1967, leading to a debate in Congress over renewing the authority for seven years. The Nixon Administration sought new authority to negotiate the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act of 1974. This act provided the President with the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs within certain parameters. It also addressed agreements requiring changes in U.S. law beyond tariff modifications. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements reducing tariffs. Implementing legislation was required for agreements involving changes beyond tariffs, to avoid lengthy congressional debate and amendment processes. This aimed to reduce special interest pressures in trade policymaking and encourage negotiations with trading partners. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements to reduce special interest pressures. Congress agreed that negotiated agreements should be given an up-or-down vote to provide assurances to trading partners. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to enter trade agreements with the condition that they would be voted up-or-down on their merits. To ensure timely consideration, Congress agreed to expedited treatment for trade agreements, limiting debate and amendments. Additionally, the executive branch was required to consult with relevant committees during negotiations and notify Congress before signing agreements. Ten Members of Congress were also accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President fast track trade negotiating authority, allowing for time-limited debate and limited amendments. Congress required consultation with relevant committees and notification 90 days before signing agreements. Ten Members of Congress were accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. This led to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT, resulting in agreements on NTBs. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill. The Tokyo Round of the GATT in 1974 resulted in agreements on NTBs like government procurement practices, product standards, and customs regulations. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress under expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures. The legislative procedures for fast track trade negotiating authority have remained unchanged since 1974, ensconced in the Trade Act of 1974. Congress has revised these provisions over the years, although they are not subject to sunset provisions. The Trade Act of 1974, as amended, grants \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" and the authority to enact tariff modifications by proclamation. These provisions have time limits and have been revised by Congress over the years. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, but did not extend presidential tariff modification authority. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. It added trade agreements authority for negotiating bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. It added trade agreements authority for negotiating bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and required congressional approval for agreements leading to tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and required congressional approval for agreements leading to tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and required congressional approval for agreements leading to tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval. The President requested an extension of such authority, which survived proposed House and Senate resolutions of disapproval. Congress greatly expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed implementing legislation for NAFTA in 1993. Multilateral negotiations under the GATT did not conclude in time, leading to an extension of authority and implementing procedures through H.R. 1876 in 1993. In 1993, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 103-182) for NAFTA and extended trade authority through H.R. 1876 (P.L. 103-49) for the Uruguay Round. The authority expired in 1994, with new authority granted in the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009; P.L. 107-210) after an eight-year hiatus. After the expiration of trade agreements authority in 1994, Congress did not approve new authority until the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009; P.L. 107-210), marking the longest hiatus since fast track was initially approved in 1974. In 1997, legislation to renew fast track was reported out by Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees but was pulled before a floor vote due to lack of support. In September 1998, the House voted on fast track authority legislation, which failed to pass (180-243) due to disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. The bill failed to pass (180-243) in 1998 due to disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. Republicans and Democrats had differing views on the scope of coverage. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations in 1999 also contributed to the lack of urgency in renewing trade agreements authority. President George W. Bush later requested a renewal of fast track authority in 2001, renaming it as \"trade promotion authority (TPA).\" In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, renaming it as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. The renewed authority included new language for labor and environmental provisions as principal negotiating objectives. Labor groups and many Members of Congress opposed TPA due to the lack of enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. The Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210) included new language for labor and environmental provisions as principal negotiating objectives. It did not mandate minimal enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and many Members of Congress. The act also established the Congressional Oversight Group (COG) for congressional consultation. The House version of the BPTA (H.R. 3005) passed by a narrow margin, mostly along party lines. The original House version of the BPTA (H.R. 3005) passed by one vote (215-214) along party lines, combined with other trade legislation in the Senate, and resulted in the Trade Act of 2002. The 2002 version of TPA approved implementing legislation for various Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed BCTPA was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden (S. 995). The Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. It is modeled after the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act of 2014 and was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. The Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) of 2015, introduced by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan, was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. The legislation, known as TPA-2015, passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37 and includes updated negotiating objectives on various trade aspects such as goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, digital trade, labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. The Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act of 2015, known as TPA-2015, includes updated negotiating objectives on various trade aspects such as agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, digital trade, labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 may be used to consider agreements from ongoing negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), and Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA), and potential agreements from ongoing negotiations are being considered through TPA/fast track to define trade policy priorities. Through TPA/fast track, Congress aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure executive branch adherence to objectives, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's authority over trade. These goals and procedural precedents are examined in the context of supporting trade negotiations. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure executive branch adherence to objectives, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's authority over trade. When trade negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers (NTBs), Congress tightened its control over negotiation and implementation by establishing \"fast track trade negotiating.\" The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was established to tighten Congress's control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation, especially when dealing with nontariff barriers (NTBs). This led to the creation of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" to expedite the process of passing implementing legislation for NTB agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) established procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, known as fast track trade negotiating authority. This allows expedited procedures for qualifying bills that meet certain conditions, including approval of the trade agreement and necessary changes to laws for implementation. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) sets procedures for fast-tracking trade implementing legislation through Congress. The implementing bill must approve the agreement, make necessary law changes, and give Congress control over approval and implementation. Congress grants the President authority to enforce the agreement after partner countries comply with provisions. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress control over trade agreements by allowing the President to enforce them after partner countries comply with provisions. Congress sets procedures for fast-tracking trade implementing legislation, requiring notification and input before agreements are signed. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress control over trade agreements by allowing the President to enforce them after partner countries comply with provisions. Congress sets procedures for fast-tracking trade implementing legislation, requiring notification and input before agreements are signed. If the President intends to sign an agreement, certain steps must be followed, including notifying Congress 90 days prior, providing a list of required changes within 60 days of signing, and transmitting the final legal text and implementing bill to Congress after entering into the agreement. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress control over trade agreements by allowing the President to enforce them after partner countries comply with provisions. Congress sets procedures for fast-tracking trade implementing legislation, requiring notification and input before agreements are signed. If the President intends to sign an agreement, certain steps must be followed, including notifying Congress 90 days prior, providing a list of required changes within 60 days of signing, and transmitting the final legal text and implementing bill to Congress after entering into the agreement. The implementing bill is enacted into law if Congress is satisfied with the requirements, following expedited legislative procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress control over trade agreements by allowing the President to enforce them after partner countries comply with provisions. Congress sets procedures for fast-tracking trade implementing legislation, requiring notification and input before agreements are signed. The expedited legislative procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974 include mandatory introduction of the implementing bill in both houses of Congress, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives through TPA legislation. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives through TPA legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade in U.S. foreign economic and security policy. The President is expected to pursue these objectives in trade negotiations, with Congress exercising control over trade agreements through expedited legislative procedures. The President is expected to pursue trade negotiation objectives defined by Congress through TPA legislation. These objectives encompass overall, principal, and other priorities aimed at enhancing U.S. and global economies by reducing trade barriers and distortions. The Administration must honor these goals to have trade agreement implementing legislation considered under expedited rules. The trade negotiation objectives defined by Congress through TPA legislation include broad goals like enhancing U.S. and global economies, specific goals such as reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and ensuring fair regulatory practices. Consultation with Congress is also an important obligation. Language defining these objectives has been contested in the past, leading to renewal controversies. The trade negotiation objectives defined by Congress through TPA legislation include enforcing environmental and labor laws, effective dispute settlement, and protecting U.S. trade remedy laws. Controversies over language defining these objectives have been seen in the past, reflecting their importance as templates for future trade agreements. Labor provisions are emphasized in all negotiating objectives. The labor provisions in trade agreements negotiated under TPA guidelines have been contentious, especially regarding enforceable standards. This issue was highlighted during the 2005 debate on the CAFTA-DR agreement. Despite disputes, trade agreements based on TPA objectives have survived challenges in Congress. The debate on the implementing bill for the CAFTA-DR trade agreement is crucial, as trade agreements under TPA guidelines have faced challenges but have survived in Congress. The President must consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups, and notification and consultation requirements have been revised with each renewal of authority. The Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) in both chambers, created in TPA-2015, are official advisors to trade negotiation delegations. Notification and consultation requirements have been revised with each renewal of authority. The President must notify Congress 90 days before negotiations, consult with relevant committees and CAGs, and conduct special consultations on various issues. The President must notify Congress 90 days before negotiations, consult with relevant committees and CAGs, and conduct special consultations on various issues, including agriculture, import sensitive agricultural products, fishing, and textile industries tariffs. Specific notifications and consultations are required before and after agreements are signed, including notifying Congress in writing of the intention to enter into an agreement at least 90 days prior, consulting with committees and CAGs, notifying revenue committees of potential changes to trade remedy laws at least 180 days prior, and submitting private sector input. The President must notify Congress 90 days before negotiations, consult with relevant committees and CAGs, and conduct special consultations on various issues. Specific notifications and consultations are required before and after agreements are signed, including notifying Congress of the intention to enter into an agreement at least 90 days prior, consulting with committees and CAGs, notifying revenue committees of potential changes to trade remedy laws at least 180 days prior, and submitting private sector input. The Trade Promotion Authority requires the President to notify Congress 90 days before negotiations, consult with relevant committees, and release the text of the agreement 60 days prior to entering into an agreement. The consultation process is a crucial part of TPA, allowing Congress to influence trade negotiations, although its effectiveness has been questioned. The Government Accountability Office evaluated the process and found areas for improvement. The consultation process under the Trade Promotion Authority allows Congress to influence trade negotiations, but its effectiveness has been questioned. The Government Accountability Office found that despite extensive consultations, congressional staff felt they lacked sufficient time to provide input and that meetings with USTR officials were more like briefings than consultations. Staff also raised concerns about last-minute changes to draft FTA texts. Despite high-quality information and frequent meetings with USTR officials, congressional staff felt the consultation process did not allow for sufficient input into trade negotiations. Concerns were raised about last-minute changes to draft FTA texts, leading to calls for greater and earlier congressional involvement in the drafting of FTAs. Similar issues were also noted in consultations over TPP and other trade negotiations. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays or obstruction of trade implementing bills by congressional procedures. Congress adopted Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures to prevent delays or obstruction of trade implementing bills by congressional procedures. TPA procedures were designed to protect fragile consensus between trade partners from congressional amendments that would change the basic agreement. Each renewal of the trade agreements authority has provided the use of expedited procedures for a limited time to ensure congressional oversight. In crafting TPA, Congress retained constitutional authority over trade matters and included provisions to limit expedited procedures. Renewals of trade agreements authority have set time limits for the use of expedited procedures to ensure congressional oversight. TPA-2015 allows these procedures for agreements before July 1, 2021, with no deadline for implementing legislation submission for agreements entered into before the authority expires. For example, the FTA with Colombia was signed in November 2006. The TPA legislation allows expedited procedures for trade agreements until July 1, 2021, without a deadline for implementing legislation submission for agreements entered into before the authority expires. The President must request an extension of the TPA authority, which is granted unless a disapproval resolution is passed by either House of Congress. President requested an extension of the TPA authority, granted unless a disapproval resolution is passed by Congress. Resolutions must be reported out of specific committees, serving as a reminder to the executive branch of congressional oversight in trade agreement negotiations. Congress can influence agreements before finalization by ensuring the President fulfills consultation and reporting obligations. The President's trade agreement negotiations can be denied if Congress is dissatisfied. Congress can influence agreements by ensuring the President fulfills consultation and reporting obligations. A joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution can be adopted if the President fails to meet requirements, triggering the CCR procedure in TPA-2015. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber of Congress to withdraw TPA procedures for a trade agreement implementing bill if there is a failure to notify or consult with Congress. This can be triggered if a committee reports implementing legislation unfavorably. Congress reserves the right to change the rules for consideration of trade implementing bills with a vote by either house. The constitutional right of Congress to change rules for trade implementing bills can be withdrawn or overridden with a vote by either house. Cooperation between legislative and executive branches is crucial for the success of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been lacking since 1993, leading to strains in the trade legislative process. The previous Trade Promotion Authority lacked bipartisan agreement since 1993, causing strains in the trade legislative process. Congress has integrated certain procedures into the approval of trade agreements, including reviewing agreements before introducing implementing bills. Congress has integrated procedures into the approval of trade agreements, including reviewing agreements before introducing implementing bills. This involves hearings and informal markup sessions to test congressional response to the trade agreement implementing bill. The White House sends a draft of the final text of the trade agreement to Congress for informal markup sessions. These sessions allow committee members to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the implementing bill. The revenue committees may reconcile differences in their markups to reinforce congressional positions. Clarifications or translations of key points can be made in the final implementing bill without altering the basic agreement. The revenue committees may use a \"mock conference\" to reconcile differences in their markups and clarify key points in the final implementing bill. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress, as seen in the example of the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation. The Administration declined to include an amendment supported by the Senate Finance Committee in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation, citing TPA's requirement. This led to a bipartisan call for better consultation before entering into trade agreements. Congress has at times added side agreements or letters to trade deals, like the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Congress has encouraged additions or clarifications to trade agreements, resulting in side agreements or side letters. Side agreements involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement is signed, such as the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Side letters act as clarifying devices for specific issues and are common in bilateral FTAs to address congressional concerns. Both side agreements and letters require official signatures from all negotiating parties to be considered in force. Side letters are typically addressed from and to the top trade negotiating representative and accompany the agreement without changing its text. They require official signatures from all negotiating parties to be considered in force, although their enforceability is untested. Some Members of Congress rely on informal commitments from the executive branch to address special interests and concerns. For example, the Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. TPA expired on July 1, 2007. The Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and there have been criticisms of delays in requesting its renewal. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may also want to update the 2002 law governing TPA due to outdated elements and evolving policy debates. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may want to update the 2002 law governing TPA due to outdated elements and evolving policy debates. Some broader policy issues and technical changes may be considered. TPA involves more than expedited legislative procedures. It helps build consensus on trade policy, signals congressional support for FTAs, and ensures Congress's role in trade policy by defining objectives and consultation requirements. The timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until FTA negotiations are near completion for congressional action. The debate over the timing of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal continues, with some suggesting waiting until FTA negotiations are close to completion for congressional action. Congress must consider the expanded scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives and the need for updated consultation requirements. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has evolved with the changing structure of trade, leading to the need for updated Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Current negotiations address new issues such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and the impact of trade on small businesses and global supply chains. Congress should consider these factors when deciding on TPA renewal. The treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements, including issues like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade's impact on small businesses and global supply chains, is a key consideration for TPA renewal. The outcome of the Trade Act of 2002 led to partisan disagreements, delaying approval of FTAs until a bipartisan agreement was reached in the \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007. The Trade Act of 2002 resulted in a partisan vote on passage, leading to a delay in approving FTAs until the bipartisan \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007. This agreement included significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Some Democrats suggest incorporating these commitments into formal trade negotiating objectives in TPA. Some House Democrats proposed changes during the 2002 renewal debate, which have been accepted as a baseline for future trade agreements. Congress may consider including the May 10th Understanding commitments in TPA's formal trade negotiating objectives. There are differing opinions among Democrats and Republicans on the improvements needed in these provisions. TPA-2015 includes key provisions on labor and environmental aspects from the May 10th Understanding, but the extent of IPR provisions is unclear. Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the executive branch's execution of the trade negotiation consultation process required under TPA. Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the executive branch's execution of the trade negotiation consultation process required under TPA-2015, particularly regarding access to draft texts of agreements. There may be a need for Congress to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures in the evolving nature of this section of TPA. Congress can influence FTAs early in the negotiation process and ensure appropriate access to draft texts. Some Members argue they have less access than business and NGOs. Members stress the importance of staying informed to influence agreements and participate in drafting implementing bills. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade partner commitments. Members of Congress are keen on staying informed about trade agreement negotiations to influence the text and participate in drafting implementing bills. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade partner commitments, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may need to consider including language on trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Technical issues from previous TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress may need reevaluation. The use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues for reevaluation by Congress. Key issues include defining \"necessary or appropriate\" language precisely and setting a time limitation on introducing FTA implementing bills. Some Members may wish to define the \"necessary or appropriate\" language more precisely in TPA. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills and changes in FTA text raise concerns about congressional flexibility and time limits. Some argue that changes in the U.S.-South Korea FTA after negotiations could have led to FTA approval denial on technical grounds, prompting Congress to consider addressing this issue in TPA renewal. The power of TPA lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, with implications for relationships within Congress as well. The power of fast track (TPA) is based on the political compact between Congress and the President, with implications for relationships within Congress. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy to pass legislation, with TPA being a key element. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including renewing and revising TPA authority or extending a targeted TPA. Congress has options for renewing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), including renewing and revising TPA authority, extending a targeted TPA, or granting permanent TPA authority. The Ways and Means Committee is discussing the possibility of granting the President permanent fast track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in a two-tier procedure. Without TPA renewal, trade agreements could be delayed, but trade policy can still progress through other means like Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) and unilateral preference arrangements. Some Members do not support TPA due to concerns about expedited processes. The United States has conducted trade negotiations without TPA authority in place. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about expedited procedures. Legislation to renew TPA was signed in the 114th Congress, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation includes expanded requirements for executive branch consultation with Congress and private sector advisers. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, maintaining the basic structure of previous TPA/fast-track laws. It includes expanded requirements for executive branch consultation with Congress and private sector advisers, along with sets of trade negotiating objectives covering various topics. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, maintaining the basic structure of previous TPA/fast-track laws. It includes expanded requirements for executive branch consultation with Congress and private sector advisers, along with trade negotiating objectives covering various topics such as trade in goods, services, foreign investment, intellectual property, transparency, regulatory practices, dispute settlement, trade in agriculture, labor, environment, border taxes, trade remedy laws, textile negotiations, digital trade, cross-border data flows, state-owned enterprises, localization barriers, currency, and human rights. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, including currency and human rights as \"principal trade negotiating objectives.\" Congressional Trade Agreements Authority Requested by and Granted to Presidents Since 1934 Congressional Timeline under TPA A Short Guide to the Expedited Legislative Procedures for Passage of Trade Implementing Bills Under TPA. Before the formal TPA expedited procedures come into play, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees typically hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of the implementing legislation. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of implementing legislation before sending final drafts to Congress. The vote and amendments made during these meetings are not binding on the Administration. The President then sends the final legal draft of the trade agreement and implementing bill to Congress, which must introduce identical bills in each house on the day received. The draft bill, reflecting amendments from mock markups, is sent to Congress on a session day. Identical bills must be introduced in both houses, referred to relevant committees, and reported within 45 session days. The Senate Finance Committee must act on the House bill for revenue bills subject to TPA procedures. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on revenue bills, with limited debate and no amendments allowed. A bill passes by a simple majority, and the second house to act typically debates its own bill before taking a final vote. The chamber must complete floor action on a bill within 15 days, after which any Member can bring it to a vote. The bill passes by a simple majority, and the second house typically debates its own bill before taking a final vote. The implementing bill enters into force for the United States when the President proclaims it, after ensuring partner countries meet obligations. After the implementing bill is signed, the trade agreement enters into force for the United States when the President proclaims it, following assurance from the USTR that partner countries have met all obligations. The President exchanges notes with the trading partner government to set a specific date for the agreement's entry into force."
