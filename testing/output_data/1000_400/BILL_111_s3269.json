    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers, especially 16-year-olds, have significantly higher crash rates compared to drivers aged 30-60. They account for over a third of fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with two-thirds of the fatalities being other drivers, passengers, or pedestrians. The presence of peers in the vehicle doubles the crash risk for 16-17-year-old drivers and quadruples it if there are two peers. According to research, teenage drivers have higher crash rates, with over a third of fatalities in crashes involving them being other individuals. The presence of peers in the vehicle increases crash risk, and cognitive distraction from cell phones can degrade a driver's performance, especially for teenage drivers. Nighttime driving is also a significant factor in teenage driver fatalities. The use of cell phones can significantly impair a teenage driver's performance, especially at night where over 50% of teenage driver fatalities occur. Graduated driver licensing systems have shown a decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers. Between 1995 and 2000, crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased significantly in Michigan, North Carolina, and California due to the implementation of comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems. Teenage passenger deaths and injuries in California involving 16-year-old drivers declined by 40%, and at-fault collisions decreased by 24%. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems, but many states have not yet included other basic safety features to protect teenage and novice drivers. A 2001 Harris Poll shows that 95% of Americans support a requirement for graduated driver licensing laws. Many states lack essential safety features in graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers. A 2001 Harris Poll reveals strong support for requirements such as practice driving hours, learner's permit periods, and restrictions on teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods. State graduated driver licensing laws are essential for protecting teenage and novice drivers, with support for requirements such as practice driving hours, learner's permit periods, and restrictions on teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage licensing process, starting with a learner's permit stage that lasts at least 6 months and prohibits the use of cell phones while driving. The graduated driver licensing laws include a learner's permit stage starting at 16 years old, lasting at least 6 months, prohibiting cell phone use and night driving, and transitioning to an intermediate stage after expiration. The intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing starts after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cell phone use, night driving, and limits non-familial passengers under 21 without a licensed driver over 21 present. In the learner's permit stage, driving at night is prohibited, only one non-familial passenger under 21 is allowed with a licensed driver over 21 present, and the restrictions remain until the driver turns 18. Additional requirements may include 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training and a driver training course. In the learner's permit stage, transportation requirements may include 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver over 21 while operating a vehicle. In the learner's permit or intermediate stage, a requirement for individuals to be of a certain age while driving, and a delay in obtaining an unrestricted driver's license for those convicted of driving-related offenses such as driving while intoxicated or reckless driving. In the learner's permit or intermediate stage, individuals convicted of driving-related offenses like driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, not wearing a seat belt, speeding, or any other offense determined by the Secretary. The Secretary of Transportation will create regulations for implementation. Incentive grants are provided as part of the regulations created by the Secretary of Transportation for individuals in the learner's permit or intermediate stage who have committed driving-related offenses. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment. States must submit an application with certification from the Governor to be considered for the grant. The Secretary will review each application to determine compliance with section 3(a). Amounts appropriated for this section will be used for grants. The Secretary will award grants to compliant States based on their applications with certification from the Governor. The grants will be apportioned based on a specific ratio of funds under section 402 of title 23, United States Code. States can use the grant funds for various purposes. The Secretary will award grants to compliant States based on their applications with certification from the Governor. The grants will be apportioned based on a specific ratio of funds under section 402 of title 23, United States Code. States can use the grant funds for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials related to the State graduated driver licensing law, and carrying out administrative activities relevant to the State's 2-stage licensing process. The Secretary will award grants to compliant States for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials, and carrying out administrative activities. $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for this purpose from the Highway Trust Fund. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a), increasing to 5 percent in the fifth fiscal year. Beginning after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary will withhold 5% of funds from states not compliant with section 3(a) in the first to fifth fiscal years, and 10% in the sixth and subsequent fiscal years. The Act requires the Secretary to withhold 10% of funds from states not compliant with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. Withheld funds are available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation. After the enactment of this Act, funds withheld under subsection (a) can be distributed to the State until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation. Any amount withheld after the sixth fiscal year may not be distributed. If a State complies with section 3(a) before the funds expire, the Secretary of Transportation will apportion the withheld funds. If a State complies with section 3(a) before the funds expire, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute any remaining withheld funds for apportionment. The distributed amount will be available for expenditure by the State until the end of the third fiscal year following the year of apportionment, after which any unspent funds will revert back to the Treasury. Any funds distributed under paragraph (1) must be spent by the State within three fiscal years, or the unspent amount will return to the Treasury. If a State is not compliant with section 3(a), any withheld funds will also revert back to the Treasury."
