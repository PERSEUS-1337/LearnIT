    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed an appropriations bill that includes $100 million more than the Administration's request. The House passed an FY2019 appropriations bill for Energy and Water Development, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, that includes $100 million more than the Administration requested for Yucca Mountain. However, the Senate version of the bill passed on June 25, 2018, includes no Yucca Mountain funding. DOE had submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository to the NRC on June 3, 2008, as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The DOE submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository to the NRC in 2008. The Obama Administration halted funding for the project in 2010 and moved to withdraw the application. Despite Congress approving the funding halt, Yucca Mountain remains the sole candidate site. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new waste policy, which recommended creating a new organization to handle nuclear waste. The Obama Administration terminated the Yucca Mountain repository project and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new nuclear waste policy. The commission recommended creating a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a consent-based process. Additionally, long-term research on waste disposal technologies was advised. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing nuclear waste facilities through negotiations and conducting long-term research on waste disposal technologies. In response, the DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in 2013, calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The DOE strategy included plans for an interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility was planned to open by 2021, followed by a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The House approved a bill in 2018 to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste storage. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report for the Yucca Mountain repository in response to a court order. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report for the Yucca Mountain repository in response to a court order, determining compliance with safety and environmental standards. The report stated that construction should not be authorized until all land and water rights requirements are met and a supplement to DOE's environmental impact statement is completed. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report for the Yucca Mountain repository in October 2014, stating compliance with safety and environmental standards. They recommended not authorizing construction until all land and water rights requirements are met and a supplement to DOE's environmental impact statement is completed. NRC requested $330 million for additional appropriations to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on issues raised by Nevada. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain. Stephen Burns testified on March 4, 2015, that his agency would need $330 million in additional appropriations to complete the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain repository. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million for NRC licensing activities and $120 million for DOE to defend its license application. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste, reversing a 1985 decision to dispose of defense and civilian nuclear waste together. The DOE proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, citing potential ease in siting, licensing, and construction due to the smaller volume and radioactivity of defense waste. The DOE proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, stating that it could be sited and developed without amending the NWPA. The repository would need to be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and comply with NWPA requirements. The disposal of defense waste could potentially start 22 years after a consent-based siting process. However, a report by the Government Accountability Office in January 2017 criticized the DOE's analysis for excluding significant costs and having an unrealistic schedule. The Government Accountability Office criticized DOE's draft plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository, stating it excluded major costs and had an optimistic schedule. Legislation has been introduced to block development of this repository until a licensing decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Legislation introduced in 2017 and 2018 aims to block the development of a defense-only nuclear waste repository until a decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, provisions for consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel were included in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The Senate passed H.R. 5895, which includes provisions for a consent-based pilot program for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. The Department of Energy would need consent from the governor, localities, and Indian tribes to select a site for a pilot storage facility. The DOE must report to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and ensure that waste is eventually moved to a permanent repository. Similar provisions have been included in previous Energy and Water Development funding bills. The Senate passed H.R. 5895, which includes provisions for a consent-based pilot program for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. The bill would authorize DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities owned by non-federal entities, with consent from the governor, local governments, and affected Indian tribes. This is part of efforts to ensure that waste stored at a pilot storage facility will be moved to a permanent underground repository within a reasonable time. Consent-based siting provisions for a monitored retrievable storage facility are also included in a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018. The House passed H.R. 3053, authorizing DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from state and local officials and affected Indian tribes. Legislation like the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 aimed to implement recommendations for nuclear waste storage. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico. S. 854 proposed an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to find storage sites for nuclear waste with consent from state and local officials and Indian tribes. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico, to be developed in 20 phases over 20 years with a total capacity of 120,000 metric tons. Holtec plans to develop a storage facility in New Mexico with a capacity of 120,000 metric tons over 20 phases. Waste Control Specialists initially applied for an NRC license for a similar facility in Texas but later formed a joint venture with Orano USA to submit a renewed application. The proposed facility would be located near Andrews, TX. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) initially applied for an NRC license for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas but later formed a joint venture with Orano USA to submit a renewed application due to high licensing costs. The proposed facility would be built near Andrews, TX, with DOE taking title to spent fuel from nuclear plants and paying WCS for storage for up to 40 years. WCS aims to complete construction by 2022, with costs covered by appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. Under the Waste Control Specialists (WCS) proposal, DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS argues that a privately developed spent fuel storage facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions. Legislation (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018, includes provisions to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. Legislation (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018, allows DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The bill is similar to previous ones introduced in the 114th Congress but not enacted. DOE could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to pay for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested funding for Yucca Mountain, which was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for Yucca Mountain. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested $1.5 billion for private interim storage, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for Yucca Mountain, with DOE receiving $120 million in total for nuclear waste funding from two appropriations accounts. The FY2019 nuclear waste funding includes $120 million from two appropriations accounts: $90 million for Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The funding is part of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, combined with other bills. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version had no funding for Yucca Mountain. This follows a pattern of funding not being approved in recent years. The Senate version of the FY2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill did not include funding for Yucca Mountain, continuing a trend of funding uncertainty for nuclear waste disposal. The Department of Energy stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, totaling about $750 million per year from nuclear power generators. The fees were supposed to cover waste disposal costs as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The court ruled on November 19, 2013, to stop collecting fees on nuclear power for waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year. The Department of Energy's waste plans were deemed too vague for accurate cost estimation, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. NRC approved a final rule in 2014 on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier waste confidence rule struck down in 2012. The waste confidence rule was struck down by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2012, leading to NRC halting licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste. NRC approved a continued storage rule in 2014, allowing for final licensing decisions for new reactors to resume. After the waste confidence rule was struck down in 2012, NRC stopped licensing new facilities generating radioactive waste. NRC approved a continued storage rule in 2014, allowing final licensing decisions for new reactors to resume. A consolidated lawsuit challenging NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2016. NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, focusing on materials with low concentrations of radioactive substances that decay quickly. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, focusing on materials with low concentrations of radioactive substances that decay quickly. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure protection of the general population. The NRC proposed regulations in 2015 to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste disposal remains a contentious issue, with the focus on Yucca Mountain as a repository for highly radioactive waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for highly radioactive waste, despite strong opposition from Nevada due to safety concerns. DOE determined Yucca Mountain suitable for a repository under the Bush Administration, but the Obama Administration decided against it. The Obama Administration decided to halt the opening of the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition. Funding for the project was stopped in FY2011, leading to the closure of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2011, leading to the closure of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain in his FY2019 budget. DOE would receive $110 million for an NRC license, and NRC would get $47.7 million to consider the application. President Trump plans to restart the Yucca Mountain project, allocating $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license and $47.7 million for NRC to review the application in his FY2019 budget. Additionally, $10 million is designated for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The Obama Administration had previously attempted to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, facing opposition from Nevada and other states with radioactive waste interests. The DOE's motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application faced opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste interests. The ASLB denied the withdrawal motion, citing the NWPA's prohibition on withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC commissioners upheld this decision in a tie vote in 2011, halting further consideration of the license application. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion in 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines repository acceptability. NRC halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits filed to overturn the withdrawal were successful, with the court directing NRC to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC was directed to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report. The court directed NRC to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC completed the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report, concluding that the proposed repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards for 1 million years. NRC issued the final volumes of the report, stating that construction should not be authorized until all requirements were met. The NRC completed the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report, stating that construction should not be authorized until all requirements were met. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that additional appropriations of $330 million would be needed to complete the licensing process. The Obama Administration halted the Yucca Mountain project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. After halting the Yucca Mountain project in 2010, the Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended a new organization be given authority to develop nuclear waste repositories using a \"consent based\" process. The BRC also commissioned reports on nuclear waste policy to assist in its deliberations. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories through a \"consent based\" process. The DOE issued a strategy for managing nuclear waste, calling for the development of consent-based storage and disposal sites. This included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The DOE's strategy for managing nuclear waste includes plans for opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. To develop a consent-based siting process, the DOE invited public comment and announced public meetings in 2015. The draft consent-based siting process issued in 2017 includes five phases. The DOE's draft consent-based siting process, issued in 2017, includes five phases: initiation and community outreach, preliminary site assessment, detailed site assessment, and decision-making on interim storage or a permanent repository. The process involves public participation, legislation for waste management agencies, and grants for interested communities. The DOE's draft consent-based siting process consists of five phases: initiation and community outreach, preliminary site assessment, detailed site assessment, decision-making on interim storage or a permanent repository, and licensing, construction, operation, and closure. The process involves public participation, legislation for waste management agencies, and grants for interested communities. The timeline for each phase ranges from 1-2 years for interim storage to 15 years for a repository. The waste management agency negotiates a siting agreement approved by all required parties. Licensing, construction, operation, and closure phases take up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project and interim storage planning. The Administration's request for $10 million includes planning for interim storage services, transportation, and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completing NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage facilities within 20 years. Geologic disposal safety depends on rock formation characteristics for repository excavation. The safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste depends on rock formation characteristics for repository excavation. Worldwide consensus supports geologic isolation as the best long-term option for waste management, but specific site applications have proven challenging. The National Research Council states that geologic isolation is the best option for high-level waste (HLW) disposal, but specific sites face challenges such as water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability. Predicting waste site performance for 1 million years is uncertain, leading to public controversy over waste transportation routes. President Obama's budgets included long-term research on waste management. The uncertainty in predicting waste site performance for 1 million years has led to public controversy over waste transportation routes. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity, while the Bush Administration proposed reprocessing spent fuel to recycle long-lived elements like plutonium. However, reprocessing has been controversial due to cost concerns and potential weapons use. The Obama Administration refocused DOE's nuclear waste research on fundamental science. The Obama Administration focused on research to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity, while the Trump Administration's budget reduced funding for spent fuel reprocessing. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal, but faced opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. The approval resolution was signed into law within 90 days of continuous session. Low-level waste disposal is a source of public controversy, with current disposal sites in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. Low-level radioactive waste disposal sites in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington have generated controversy. The Washington facility only accepts waste from its region, while the South Carolina site is limited to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. Class A waste can be disposed of in a Utah facility, and threats of closure led to the opening of a new disposal site in Texas under a regional compact system in 2011. Radioactive waste (class A) is accepted by a Utah commercial disposal facility from anywhere in the United States. Congressional authorization of regional compacts for low-level waste disposal in 1985 led to the opening of a new disposal site in Texas under the regional compact system in 2011. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste for disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act authorized the DOE to enter contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste for disposal. DOE missed the deadline to begin waste disposal, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. A settlement was reached with PECO Energy Company, allowing them to keep up to $80 million in waste fee revenues. Other utilities also sued the DOE. DOE settled with PECO Energy Company, allowing them to retain $80 million in nuclear waste fee revenues. Other utilities sued DOE, arguing that fees should only be used for the waste program, not as compensation for missed disposal deadlines. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that compensation must come from sources other than the waste fund. Payments to utilities now come from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, which covers damage claims against the government without requiring appropriations. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that compensation for missed disposal deadlines must come from sources other than the waste fund. Payments to utilities now come from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling about $6.9 billion by FY2017. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. By the end of FY2017, 39 lawsuits had been settled, representing utilities generating 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. DOE estimates potential liabilities for waste program delays could total as much as $34.1 billion. DOE's potential liabilities for nuclear waste delays could reach $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid. Delays may lead to environmental enforcement actions over DOE-owned waste stored in noncompliance with laws, risking fines. Utilities must continue filing claims for delay-related costs as they accrue. The DOE faces potential liabilities of $34.1 billion for nuclear waste delays, with $6.9 billion already paid. Some waste is stored in violation of environmental laws, risking fines. DOE suspended nuclear waste fee collections in 2014 after legal challenges from the nuclear industry and state regulators. The DOE suspended nuclear waste fee collections in 2014 after legal challenges from the nuclear industry and state regulators, arguing that fees should not be collected while the federal government's nuclear waste disposal program is halted. Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined in 2010 that excess funds were not being collected for future disposal costs. The DOE suspended nuclear waste fee collections in 2014 due to legal challenges, arguing fees shouldn't be collected while the disposal program is halted. Energy Secretary Chu determined in 2010 that excess funds were not being collected for future disposal costs. However, a court ruled in 2012 that a more thorough study of the fee was needed, as the Secretary's evaluation was based on costs projected for the now terminated Yucca Mountain site. The court ordered a more thorough study of the nuclear waste fee within six months, considering costs of reasonable alternatives and timing. DOE's new fee assessment in January 2013 showed varying results, with some scenarios exceeding projected revenues by $2 trillion and others resulting in a surplus of up to $5 trillion. Due to the uncertainty, DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to immediately raise or lower the fee. The Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to the uncertainty in the program's cost estimates, which were deemed too vague to determine the fee. DOE ceased collecting fees from nuclear power generators in May 2014. The court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to uncertainty in cost estimates for the Yucca Mountain program. The Trump Administration plans to restart the program and conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates until new information is available. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for long-term nuclear waste disposal. The license application for a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain was filed with the NRC's ASLB on March 3, 2010, but the DOE's motion to withdraw it \"with prejudice\" was denied on June 29, 2010. The decision was based on the Obama Administration's policy change, citing difficulty in overcoming opposition from Nevada and a desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The withdrawal was not based on scientific or technical findings but aimed to provide finality in ending the Yucca Mountain project. The DOE's attempt to withdraw the license application for the Yucca Mountain project was denied by the ASLB on June 29, 2010. The ASLB ruled that the NWPA prohibits DOE from withdrawing the application until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. DOE argued that the Secretary of Energy has broad authority under the Atomic Energy Act in appealing the decision to the NRC commissioners. The DOE appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. The NRC commissioners sustained the denial of the license withdrawal in a tie vote, but halted further consideration due to budgetary limitations. After a year of deliberation, NRC commissioners upheld the denial of a license withdrawal for Yucca Mountain on a tie vote. NRC stopped further review due to budget constraints. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, petitioned for the licensing proceedings to continue. The Court of Appeals ruled in 2013 that NRC must proceed with the application as long as funding was available. NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015 using remaining funds. The Court of Appeals ruled in 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding was available. NRC completed its Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015 and used remaining funds for a supplemental EIS and licensing database. Additional funding of about $330 million would be needed for NRC to complete the licensing review, with DOE estimating costs at $1.9 billion. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license, pending before the ASLB. DOE's FY2018 budget request includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office. The Trump Administration plans to resume consideration of the NRC license for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. DOE estimates its costs as the license applicant to be around $1.9 billion. NRC requires proof that nuclear waste can be safely disposed of before issuing licenses, with a 1979 court decision mandating this. NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984 stating that waste could be stored safely at reactor sites for 30 years after closure, with a permanent repository expected by 2007-2009. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984, stating that nuclear waste could be safely stored at reactor sites for 30 years after closure, with a permanent repository expected by 2007-2009. However, due to delays in opening a repository, the decision was updated in 1990 to project a repository by the first quarter of the 21st century. In 2010, another waste confidence rule was issued, stating that a repository would be available \"when necessary\" and waste could be safely stored at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984, projecting a permanent repository by the first quarter of the 21st century. In 2010, a new rule stated that waste could be safely stored at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the 2010 rule, leading to a court ruling in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review under NEPA. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision, citing flaws in the rulemaking process. This led to a halt in licensing new facilities producing nuclear waste for over two years. NRC approved a final rule in 2014. The NRC failed to properly examine future dangers and consequences regarding the storage of nuclear waste at plants. Final licensing of new facilities producing nuclear waste was halted for over two years due to a court ruling. A new rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel was approved in 2014, focusing on environmental effects based on a generic environmental impact statement. The continued storage rule, based on a generic environmental impact statement, analyzed the environmental effects of short-term, long-term, and indefinite timeframes for storing spent nuclear fuel. The rule assumed active management and oversight with spent fuel canisters replaced every 100 years. Environmental impact was deemed minimal in most categories. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a lawsuit challenging the NRC's storage rule for spent nuclear fuel. The Obama Administration's decision to halt work on the Yucca Mountain repository sparked controversy in Congress, with the House supporting funding while the Senate and President Obama opposed it. President Trump's proposal to restart the licensing process for Yucca Mountain has shifted the debate on nuclear waste disposal. The Obama Administration's decision to halt work on the Yucca Mountain repository sparked congressional controversy. President Trump's proposal to restart the licensing process has changed the dynamics of the debate on nuclear waste disposal. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project but the Senate not providing any. In FY2018, the House approved funds for the Yucca Mountain project, but the Senate did not. No funds were included in the enacted appropriations bill. In FY2019, the House allocated $100 million above the Administration's funding request for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate did not provide any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during former Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmation hearing for Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed opposition to using Yucca Mountain as a dumping ground for nuclear waste. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada opposed using Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository and expressed her concerns to Governor Perry during his confirmation hearing. She believes Perry understands the issue and can work together to prevent Yucca Mountain from being used. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 would withdraw the repository site from public lands laws and place it under DOE's control, satisfying a major condition for licensing the site. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House on May 10, 2018, aiming to license the Yucca Mountain repository by withdrawing it from public lands laws and increasing its capacity to store spent nuclear fuel. The bill also authorizes DOE to store fuel at an interim storage facility and makes changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee's version, including the removal of mandatory funding provisions. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3053, aims to license the Yucca Mountain repository for storing spent nuclear fuel. It includes provisions for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage before disposal in a permanent repository. The bill eliminates mandatory funding provisions and addresses concerns about the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund for deficit reduction. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3053, includes provisions for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. The bill specifies that DOE's acceptance of spent nuclear fuel at commercial reactor sites for storage at an MRS facility would transfer ownership to the Secretary of Energy. DOE is authorized to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities, either federally or through agreements with nonfederal entities. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3053, allows for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities to store spent fuel from commercial reactors. DOE can store fuel at MRS facilities developed by nonfederal entities with agreements. DOE needs NRC license approval and state, local, and tribal waste storage approvals. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities, unless a federal facility is quicker and cheaper to build. Closed reactor fuel has priority for shipment to an MRS. The bill allows for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities to store spent fuel from commercial reactors. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities, unless a federal facility is quicker and cheaper to build. Closed reactor fuel has priority for shipment to an MRS. Appropriations for an MRS would be authorized from the general fund rather than the Nuclear Waste Fund. MRS construction would have to cease if the repository license were revoked. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be located on 147,000 acres of federal land encompassing parts of DOE's Nevada Test Site and the Nellis Air Force Range, along with public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. H.R. 3053 would permanently withdraw the site from uses authorized under federal public land laws, such as mineral leasing, and transfer jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy for activities related to development of a permanent storage facility. H.R. 3053 would permanently withdraw the Yucca Mountain site from federal public land laws, transferring jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy for a repository for nuclear waste. The site's withdrawal is necessary for DOE to obtain a repository license from NRC. NRC must issue a construction authorization for the repository within 30 months of enactment. The Yucca Mountain repository would not be subject to certain waste disposal regulations, with a final decision on construction authorization required within 30 months. The Department of Energy could conduct infrastructure activities before the decision, and the limit on spent nuclear fuel disposal would be raised. Planning for a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until a final decision is reached. The limit on nuclear fuel disposal at Yucca Mountain would increase to 110,000 metric tons. The Department of Energy is prohibited from planning a separate repository for defense-related waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Collection of nuclear waste fees cannot resume until a final decision is reached on the construction authorization for Yucca Mountain. Fees collected would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program. The bill limits nuclear waste fees to 90% of DOE appropriations, with any uncollected fees to be paid when necessary. Fees collected after enactment offset program appropriations, resulting in zero net appropriations. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance remains available without offsets, and budget direct spending is unaffected. The Water Development Appropriations bill allows the Secretary of Energy to enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments for payments related to nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would receive increased payments, including $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt and annual payments of $40 million thereafter. The Water Development Appropriations bill allows the Secretary of Energy to enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments for payments related to nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would receive increased payments, including $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt and annual payments of $40 million thereafter. DOE could also reach benefits agreements with other affected local governments, subject to congressional appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) would be responsible for carrying out the functions of the Secretary of Energy established by NWPA and would report directly to the Secretary. The Nuclear Waste Fund would be managed by the OCRWM Director, who would report directly to the Secretary of Energy and serve up to two five-year terms. Functions related to nuclear waste management would be transferred to OCRWM from a DOE Assistant Secretary. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, requiring consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for nuclear waste expenditures. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act (S. 95, H.R. 456) introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus requires consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for nuclear waste expenditures. Additionally, the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson would prevent the DOE from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a final decision on a construction permit for the Yucca. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson would prohibit the DOE from building a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC makes a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, there are proposals for private-sector interim storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico, with a bill (H.R. 474) introduced to authorize DOE to contract with these facilities. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa authorizes DOE to contract with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 is similar to previous legislation but not enacted. DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors at private storage facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. Another bill (H.R. 4442) introduced by Representative Lowey authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. The Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) provides assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites, offering financial support and tax credits. The bills introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) aim to provide financial support and tax credits to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. The legislation includes a $15 per kilogram payment for nuclear waste, revival of a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in affected communities, and eligibility for the New Markets Tax Credit. Additionally, a task force would be established to streamline government assistance programs for these communities and explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. The bill introduced in Congress aims to address concerns about spent fuel storage in nuclear power plants by requiring the development of NRC-approved plans for transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities. Emergency planning zones would also be expanded from 10 to 50 miles. H.R. 4891, introduced by Representative Engel on February 2, 2018, requires nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for removing spent fuel from storage pools. Spent fuel must be transferred to dry storage facilities within seven years if it has been in a storage pool for at least seven years. Emergency planning zones would be expanded to a 50-mile radius around reactors not in compliance. NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to provide grants for fuel transfer. H.R. 4891, introduced by Representative Engel, requires nuclear power plants to transfer spent fuel to dry storage facilities. Similar legislation has been introduced in previous Congresses to redirect the nuclear waste program and establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for storage and disposal facilities. The proposed legislation, S. 854, aimed to establish the Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for developing nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The plan included opening a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048, with consent required from affected state, local, and tribal governments for facility siting. NWA could only select sites for nonpriority waste storage after 10 years if funds were allocated for a permanent repository. The proposed legislation, S. 854, aimed to establish the Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for developing nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. NWA would have been authorized to issue requests for proposals or select sites for storage facilities for nonpriority waste only if funds were allocated for a permanent repository within the first 10 years. NWA could offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting facilities, with preference given to sites including storage facilities along with a repository. Defense waste could be placed in defense-only facilities under S. 854, authorized by President Obama in 2015. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository on March 24, 2015 under S. 854. Nuclear waste fees collected after enactment of the bill were to be held in a Working Capital Fund. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 on July 30, 2013. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 on July 30, 2013. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill, while NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd called it a step in the right direction. Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed the bill. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 regarding the Yucca Mountain repository. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd supported the bill, while Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed it. S. 854 would require actions on a permanent repository before a storage facility for nonpriority waste could be sited. Authorization and initial funding for a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility were approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in its version of the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. Authorization and initial funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility were approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in its version of the FY2017 Energy and Water bill on April 14, 2016. The bill included an authorization and a $10.0 million appropriation for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. Similar language had been approved in previous years' Energy and Water bills by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee included language in various appropriations bills related to nuclear waste policy, influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan. The debate over this policy has been ongoing, with the Senate introducing bills to address spent fuel storage. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan, caused by an earthquake and tsunami, raised concerns about spent fuel storage. Legislation was proposed to maintain safety at closed reactors until fuel is moved to dry storage, but was not enacted. A study by the NRC found that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. Radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials. The NRC study on spent fuel storage concluded that expedited transfer to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits and not be cost-effective. Radioactive waste varies in radioactivity levels and decay rates, with some types remaining dangerous for thousands of years. Major types of radioactive waste include spent nuclear fuel from reactors. Spent nuclear fuel is the most radioactive type of civilian nuclear waste, containing short-lived fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel. High-level waste is the highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing, containing most radioactive fission products but with uranium and plutonium usually removed. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, requiring radiation shielding for handling. Transuranic waste, containing long-lived radioactive elements heavier than uranium, requires isolation for 10,000 years or more. In the United States, it is primarily generated by nuclear weapons production processes. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, which resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste is radioactive waste not classified as spent. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste disposal facilities have concentration limits set by the NRC. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like materials. Low-level waste disposal facilities have concentration limits set by the NRC. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC and EPA. Mixed waste, which includes radioactive material, poses complex regulatory challenges as the radioactive portion is overseen by DOE or NRC, while the nonradioactive elements are regulated by the EPA and states. Spent nuclear fuel, removed from reactors after years of use, is highly radioactive and thermally hot, typically in the form of fuel assemblies containing metal-clad fuel rods enriched in U-235. The spent nuclear fuel is highly radioactive and thermally hot, stored in fuel assemblies of metal-clad rods enriched in U-235. After fission in the reactor, U-235 nuclei split into radioactive fission products and some U-238 nuclei become radioactive plutonium. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in water pools to prevent overheating and protect workers. Older fuel is sealed in dry canisters to prevent pool overflow. The spent nuclear fuel, enriched in U-235, undergoes fission in reactors, producing radioactive fission products and plutonium. Newly withdrawn fuel assemblies are stored in water pools to prevent overheating. Older fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to shielded storage facilities. The NRC mandates a cooling period of 7-10 years before dry storage. The U.S. nuclear industry stores spent fuel at various sites, with an average annual discharge of 2,200 metric tons. The U.S. nuclear power industry stores about 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel at various sites, including 30,000 metric tons in dry casks. This amount exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, with additional DOE waste planned for disposal. The storage of spent fuel will continue to increase until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is established. The U.S. nuclear power industry stores about 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. DOE's estimates project a total of 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel that may need disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system, with utilities expected to build new dry storage facilities at reactor sites. The U.S. nuclear power industry stores about 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. DOE's estimates project a total of 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel that may need disposal. New storage capacity at operating nuclear plant sites or other locations will be required if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel have been raised, especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Reports have highlighted the potential risks of overheating spent fuel, but the probability of such incidents is considered low. The NRC and NAS reports highlighted the risk of terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools, with the potential for overheating and fires releasing radioactivity. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the risk. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time for alternative cooling measures before fuel catches fire. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time for alternative cooling measures before fuel catches fire. NRC's report in 2013 found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers of spent fuel from pools to dry casks. NRC task force recommended improved safety measures for spent fuel pools, including water spray systems and assured sources of electrical power. NRC also approved an order requiring reactors to install enhanced water-level monitoring equipment in their spent fuel pools. The Fukushima accident led to recommendations for improved safety measures in U.S. nuclear power plants, including the availability of electrical power and water spray systems for spent fuel pools. The NRC approved an order in 2012 for reactors to install enhanced water-level monitoring equipment. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was sent to disposal sites, with varying volumes and radioactivity levels each year. In 2017, the DOE reported that volumes and radioactivity of low-level waste can vary yearly due to nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. The total volume reported for 2016 was 1.7 million cubic feet. Low-level waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for handling and disposal, with Class A waste making up most of the volume and classes B and C containing the majority of radioactivity. Most of the nation's Class B and C waste has been stored on-site since June 2008 due to the lack of a permanent disposal site. States can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste, while disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository after FY2010, although it remains the sole candidate site for civilian highly radioactive waste disposal. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019, requesting funds for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. DOE issued an alternative waste management strategy in January 2013 calling for a pilot facility for spent fuel. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the Yucca Mountain program in FY2019 with funding requests for Yucca Mountain, interim nuclear waste storage at DOE, and NRC. Under the Obama Administration, a waste management strategy called for a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of nuclear waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The fee for the program can be adjusted based on projected costs. The act was modified in 1987 by the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The act was modified in 1987 by the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, which mandated DOE to select Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a high-level waste repository. The amendments also authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility for spent fuel. The 1987 amendments authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility for spent fuel, but DOE cannot select a site until recommending a permanent repository be built at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for Yucca Mountain and transferred waste management functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to develop a new waste management strategy. The Obama Administration terminated OCRWM and transferred its functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. Previous voluntary waste site efforts failed, but the commission expressed confidence in eventual success based on the U.S. experience with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing negotiations with states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The commission highlighted the U.S. experience with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico as a successful example. The BRC recommended the establishment of a congressionally chartered federal corporation for the new waste management program. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for a new waste management program. The corporation would be independent, have assured access to funds, and be subject to congressional oversight and NRC regulation. The BRC also called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim central storage facilities to remove waste from shutdown reactor sites. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a federal corporation for a new waste management program, including interim storage facilities to remove waste from shutdown reactor sites. The DOE issued a strategy for managing nuclear waste, with plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a larger facility by 2025. The DOE strategy for managing nuclear waste includes plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a larger facility by 2025, with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons or more. The strategy aims to link the interim storage facility to the development of a permanent repository to prevent it from becoming a de facto repository. However, current restrictions on the MRS are so rigid that it cannot be built, and the strategy recommends not overly restricting progress on storage facilities. The DOE strategy for managing nuclear waste includes plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a larger facility by 2025. NWPA restrictions on the MRS are too rigid for it to be built currently. A geologic disposal facility is planned to open by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of design and licensing by 2042. Sites for storage and disposal facilities will be selected through a \"consent based\" process, but details on implementation are lacking. The DOE's strategy for managing nuclear waste includes plans for interim storage facilities by 2021 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The selection of sites for storage and disposal will be done through a \"consent based\" process, but details on implementation are lacking. The Obama Administration's proposed waste program would be implemented by a new nuclear waste management entity, but the nature of this organization was not specified. The DOE's waste program includes plans for interim storage facilities by 2021 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. A bill introduced in Congress would modify the waste program along the lines of the Obama Administration's strategy. DOE recommended testing a consent-based approach for siting a repository solely for defense and research waste, separate from civilian nuclear waste. This would reverse the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both types of waste. The DOE recommended testing a consent-based approach for siting a separate repository solely for defense and research waste, which would reverse the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both civilian and defense high-level waste. This new approach could allow for quicker development within existing legislative authority, with deep boreholes being considered for compact types of waste. President Obama authorized planning for this separate underground repository in 2015. The report recommended a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities, authorized by President Obama in 2015. However, the plan faced criticism from the GAO in 2017, leading to bills being introduced to delay it. President Obama blocked the preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015 but alternative routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists filed for an NRC license in 2016 to develop a consolidated waste management facility. The Obama Administration blocked the rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015 but alternative routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists filed for an NRC license in 2016 to develop a consolidated waste management facility in Texas. They later formed a joint venture with Orano USA and submitted a renewed application for the facility in 2018. The proposed spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA and submitted a renewed application for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas. The facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with construction taking place in eight phases. Each phase would hold 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel, totaling 40,000 metric tons. DOE would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. Under the WCS proposal, DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS contends that a privately developed spent fuel storage facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. An NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Local officials have supported additional waste facilities at the site, originally planned for high-level waste. New Mexico Governor expressed support for the project in a letter to Energy Secretary, but state senators have raised concerns. New Mexico Governor supported the acceptance of high-level waste and spent fuel at the WIPP site, with conditions including assistance with cleaning up contaminated uranium sites. State senators opposed an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. Public support for expanded waste activities may be affected by a 2014 radioactive release from WIPP. Other groups in Mississippi and Texas have shown interest in hosting nuclear waste sites. The suspension of disposal operations in New Mexico could impact public support for expanded waste activities. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation introduced by Representative Issa (H.R. 474) and Representative Conaway (H.R. 3643) would authorize DOE to enter into contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to the private storage facility under the Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017. The bill introduced by Representative Conaway in the 114th Congress (H.R. 3643) allows DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors at a private storage facility. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund can be used by DOE to fund private interim storage. The bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas. Previous efforts for a private spent fuel storage facility were made when DOE missed the 1998 deadline for waste removal. An earlier attempt to develop a private spent fuel storage facility was initiated due to DOE's delay in removing nuclear waste from reactor sites by the 1998 deadline. A consortium signed an agreement with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah to build a storage facility on tribal land. The Private Fuel Storage (PFS) consortium obtained a 20-year license from the NRC in 2006 to store up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks. However, the Department of the Interior rejected the project in 2006, citing concerns about the risk of waste remaining indefinitely at the site. The Department of the Interior rejected the Private Fuel Storage (PFS) project in 2006 due to concerns about the risk of waste remaining indefinitely at the site. A federal lawsuit was filed to overturn the decision, leading to a federal court ordering the Department of the Interior to reconsider its decisions on the PFS permits. However, PFS eventually asked the NRC to terminate its license in 2012. The Goshutes and PFS filed a federal lawsuit in 2007 to challenge Interior's decisions, citing political motivation. A court ordered Interior to reconsider PFS permits in 2010. PFS later requested NRC to terminate its license in 2012. The Obama Administration attempted to shift focus from Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste, but current law still centers on it. NWPA mandates NRC licensing for waste repositories, with EPA setting standards. DOE's siting guidelines must be approved by NRC. Waste transportation is regulated by NRC and DOT. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required EPA to establish new repository standards for Yucca Mountain. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act mandates NRC licensing for waste repositories, with EPA setting standards. DOE's siting guidelines must be approved by NRC, and waste transportation is regulated by NRC and DOT. Compliance with EPA's standards is required for NRC licensing at Yucca Mountain. The NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain, at 10 C.F.R. 63, mandate compliance with EPA's standards and establish procedures for DOE to follow in seeking a repository license. DOE needs construction authorization before obtaining a license to bring nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were created due to concerns about meeting EPA's general standards. The Yucca Mountain standards limit the radiation dose the repository could impose on individuals. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were required to ensure compliance with EPA's standards. The standards limit radiation dose to the public and were based on a study by the National Academy of Sciences. The study recommended focusing on limiting risk to individuals near the repository rather than specific limits on radioactive material releases. Additionally, the study found no scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousands of years into the future. The EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and groundwater exposure. The standard aimed to result in a low annual risk of fatal cancer. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as overly strict. The EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, aiming to limit annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and groundwater exposure. The final standards, issued on June 6, 2001, included an overall exposure limit of 15 millirems and a groundwater limit of 4 millirems for the first 10,000 years of repository operation. The nuclear industry criticized the EPA's proposal as overly stringent, while environmental groups argued that the 10,000-year standard was too short considering projected radioactive releases peaking after about 400,000 years. The final Yucca Mountain standards, issued on June 6, 2001, included a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite the DOE's opposition, the site was deemed able to meet these standards. The NRC revised its regulations to align with the EPA standards in September 2001. However, a U.S. Court of Appeals panel later struck down the 10,000-year compliance period in the standards, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. The court struck down the 10,000-year compliance period in the Yucca Mountain standards, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. In response, EPA proposed new standards with dose limits for the first 10,000 years and a higher annual dose for the period from 10,000 years to 1 million years. EPA also proposed basing the post-10,000-year standard on the median dose. The EPA proposed new standards for Yucca Mountain on August 9, 2005, with dose limits for the first 10,000 years and a higher annual dose of 350 millirems for 10,000 to 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the leniency of the proposed standard. The final rule, issued on September 30, 2008, reduced the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for 10,000 to 1 million years. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The annual dose limit for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years at Yucca Mountain was reduced from 350 to 100 millirems, aligning with international standards. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will now be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The 4 millirem groundwater standard applies only to the first 10,000 years. NRC updated its licensing regulations to meet the new EPA standards in 2009. DOE's 2008 FSEIS estimated a maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years of 2 millirems, significantly lower than previous estimates. The Yucca Mountain repository's recent Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) projected a maximum mean annual individual dose of 2 millirems after 10,000 years, a significant reduction from previous estimates. This decrease was attributed to changes in DOE's computer model and assumptions. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on various technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including those related to the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposal included $88.5 million for Fuel Cycle R&D. The Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposal included $88.5 million for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management activities. The FY2019 budget request includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D and no funding for integrated waste management. The program focuses on reprocessing spent fuel for plutonium and uranium recycling. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management activities. The focus of the Fuel Cycle R&D program is on technology related to reprocessing spent fuel for plutonium and uranium recycling. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance stood at $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017, with $7.41 billion disbursed before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2010. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017, with $7.41 billion disbursed before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2010. The Yucca Mountain program was estimated to cost $96.2 billion from 1983 to 2133. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste. The Yucca Mountain program, estimated to cost $96.2 billion from 1983 to 2133, was released on August 5, 2008. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste, with most joining interstate compacts for disposal. Two commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts after 1992. The nation's commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could start refusing waste from outside their regional compacts after 1992. One site in Nevada closed, leaving two in South Carolina and Washington using their authority to prohibit waste from outside their compacts. A new disposal facility in Texas opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class A, B, and C waste, with some capacity available for waste from other states. A new disposal facility for Class A, B, and C low-level waste opened near Andrews, TX in 2012. It aims to alleviate storage issues and can accept waste from other states. The facility received its first shipment from Vermont in April 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact was signed in 1998, but a proposed site near Sierra Blanca, TX was rejected. Governor Rick Perry authorized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to license disposal facilities in 2003. In 2003, Texas Governor Rick Perry authorized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to license disposal facilities for low-level waste. The Andrews County disposal facility was approved in 2011 after an application was filed in 2004. The Barnwell, SC facility is currently accepting waste from the Atlantic Compact. The Barnwell, SC disposal facility began accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact in 2011 after acquiring necessary land and mineral rights. South Carolina can limit facility use to compact members and phased out noncompact waste acceptance by 2008. The facility had previously stopped accepting waste from outside the Southeast Compact in 1994. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina stopped accepting waste from outside the Southeast Compact in June 1994. South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1995 and began accepting waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina was not subject to sanctions under the compact. The only other disposal facility for low-level waste is in Hanford, WA, controlled by the Northwest Compact. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that this withdrawal did not subject North Carolina to sanctions. The Hanford site in Washington is the only other disposal facility for low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing of low-level waste facilities is regulated by the NRC or agreement states approved by the NRC, with transportation jointly regulated by the NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to its disposal regulations in 2015. The NRC regulates low-level waste licenses according to environmental and radiation protection guidelines. Proposed modifications to disposal regulations were submitted in 2015 and further revisions were issued in 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites to ensure long-term protection. The NRC staff drafted regulations to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites, ensuring protection for the general population. Analysis must be conducted for a 1,000-year compliance period if no significant radioactive material is present, and for a 10,000-year period if significant quantities are present. Additional analysis may be required for post-10,000 years and to protect against inadvertent intruders. Current regulations date back to 1982, and the disposal of radioactive waste remains a key issue in the nuclear power debate. The NRC staff drafted regulations in 1982 to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites, ensuring protection for the general population. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, especially with the need for a national waste management system. President Obama's actions to terminate the Yucca Mountain project have halted most activities in the DOE waste program. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama's actions to terminate the project have halted most activities. Congress is debating the project's future, with the NRC finding in 2014 that the site would meet standards. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart licensing and the retirement of Senator Reid may affect legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart Yucca Mountain licensing and the retirement of Senator Reid may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. The funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Existing reactor owners may seek damages from the government due to disposal delays. The Trump Administration has requested funding for Yucca Mountain licensing to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. Owners of existing reactors may seek damages from the government due to disposal delays, with potential liabilities estimated at $34.1 billion. Lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could impact the licensing of proposed new nuclear plants. The nuclear industry faces potential liabilities of up to $34.1 billion due to disposal delays. The lack of a waste disposal system could impact the licensing of new nuclear plants. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options such as centralized interim storage and reprocessing to address the delays. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed nuclear waste disposal delays in its final report, recommending options like centralized interim storage and reprocessing. A congressionally chartered corporation was suggested to site new waste facilities, with longer on-site storage likely due to program shutdown delays. The \"consent based\" siting process has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. On-site storage is a certainty under any option. The \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission has attracted serious interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Cooperation of states is crucial for success. The success of any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort for nuclear waste disposal relies on the cooperation of potential host states.
