    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and importing goods to boost consumer welfare. The United States imports goods for various reasons, including scarcity, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency by foreign firms. The United States imports goods and services to boost consumer welfare by accessing a greater variety of products at lower costs. Imports contain U.S.-made components or raw materials, improving consumer purchasing power and controlling inflation. Trade also helps producers access lower-cost inputs, enhancing global competitiveness. Trade improves consumer purchasing power by providing access to a greater variety of goods at lower costs, benefiting lower-income households. It also helps control inflation and enhances global competitiveness through lower-cost inputs and exports. Trade leads to greater competition, innovation, and economic growth, as explained by economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage. Trade leads to greater competition and can pressure firms to innovate and invest in research and development (R&D), supporting increased productivity and economic growth. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries trade today, emphasizing specialization and mutual benefits even if a country is more efficient in producing all goods. Ricardo argued that the opportunity cost, not just the absolute cost of production, determines whether specialization and trade should occur. Ricardo argued that comparing absolute costs of production between countries is less relevant for determining specialization and trade due to immobile resources. Instead, the focus should be on opportunity cost - the output forgone to produce one more unit of a good. Countries have a comparative advantage in goods with lower opportunity costs, leading to gains from trade through specialization. Subsequent economic theories have built upon and refined the theory of comparative advantage. Economists have expanded on the theory of comparative advantage, examining its relevance in today's complex trade patterns with global value chains, services, digital trade, and cross-border flows of data and technology. Differences in comparative advantage between countries can be attributed to factors like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Economists have expanded on the theory of comparative advantage, examining its relevance in today's complex trade patterns with global value chains, services, digital trade, and cross-border flows of data and technology. Differences in comparative advantage between countries may arise due to factors like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Countries will have a comparative advantage in activities that make intensive use of their relatively abundant factors of production, such as high-skilled labor in the United States leading to the production of goods like aircraft. Differences in productive technology among countries can also affect relative efficiency and serve as a basis for comparative advantage. The United States has a relative abundance of high-skilled labor and scarcity of low-skilled labor, leading to a comparative advantage in goods like aircraft. Productive technology differences among countries can also impact efficiency and comparative advantage. Governments can influence this through policies that indirectly or directly nurture advantages in specific industries. Policies can influence comparative advantage through indirect or direct means, such as eliminating corruption, enforcing property rights, and supporting certain industries with subsidies or tariffs. There is debate on the effectiveness of targeted policies in promoting economic growth. Protectionist policies, such as subsidies or tariffs, aim to support industries with strategic and economic potential. However, there is debate on their effectiveness, as they can distort trade flows and hinder the development of competitive industries. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies with similar resource endowments and levels of development. Intra-industry trade between advanced economies suggests trade based on economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. Countries specialize in producing and trading a subset of goods due to limited productive capacity. Trade between countries leads to specialization in producing and trading specific goods, driving changes in employment, wages, and the distribution of income. Overall, trade has a positive impact on economic well-being by promoting resource efficiency, competition, economies of scale, and consumer welfare, ultimately boosting GDP. Trade has a net positive effect on a country's economic well-being by promoting resource efficiency, competition, economies of scale, and consumer welfare. Increases in trade can boost GDP and reduce extreme poverty. However, the benefits are not evenly distributed, with some sectors experiencing disruptions and job losses. The economic impact of trade on jobs and wages is widely debated due to various factors, including technological changes. Trade can disrupt sectors, causing job losses and stagnant wages in certain regions and industries. While economy-wide gains from trade generally exceed costs, the challenge lies in dealing equitably with those affected. Economists suggest policies that aid adjustment and compensate for losses are more economically efficient than protective measures. Adjustment assistance for potentially displaced individuals is crucial from both economic and political perspectives. Policies that aid adjustment and compensate for losses caused by market forces, like trade, are more cost-effective than protective measures. Experts emphasize the importance of providing assistance to those potentially displaced by trade for maintaining political support. Debate continues on the effectiveness of current policies in the US to help communities affected by trade. Trade can both create and destroy jobs, leading to job churn and occupational exposure to trade. Disruptions can also occur domestically when firms relocate between states. Trade creates and destroys jobs in the economy, leading to job churn and occupational exposure. Disruptions can occur domestically when firms relocate between states. Trade liberalization shifts jobs into industries with comparative advantage and away from industries with comparative disadvantage, resulting in a change in employment composition. Job loss attributed to trade is a small share of jobs lost economy-wide each year. Trade liberalization shifts jobs into industries with comparative advantage and away from industries with comparative disadvantage. Estimates suggest that job loss attributed to trade is a small share of jobs lost economy-wide each year, with some workers likely to be reemployed elsewhere. However, short-run costs to workers attempting to switch occupations or industries due to trade liberalization may be substantial, including reduced wages. Increased import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Increased import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Most economists argue that equating net imports with a specific amount of unemployment is questionable. U.S. global trade has expanded during periods of economic growth, with the trade deficit and unemployment rate moving in tandem. The U.S. trade deficit and unemployment rate have historically moved together during periods of economic growth. International trade can impact worker wages, but there is no consensus on the effects of trade agreements. Other factors like technological change have had a larger impact on wages and income inequality in the United States. The impact of trade agreements on wages of U.S. workers and income inequality has deepened. Trade tends to increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers while decreasing returns for low-skilled labor. Imports from countries like China can negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. Imports from countries like China could negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. U.S. workers face competition from lower-cost producers in developing countries, leading some multinational corporations to shift production overseas. However, workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average, with a 16% earnings premium in export-intensive manufacturing industries. Economic globalization involves the integration of national economies through trade, financial flows, and technology transfer. U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average, with a 16% earnings premium in manufacturing and a 15.5% premium in services. There have been periods of both globalization and deglobalization. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor migration. Experts note periods of globalization and deglobalization. Global trade as a percentage of GDP increased from 25% to 57% from 1960 to 2017. Global FDI grew from 6% to 39% of GDP from 1980 to 2017, facilitated by advances in transport and communication. Global trade has grown faster than GDP historically, with the stock of global foreign direct investment increasing significantly. The integration of the world economy has been aided by advancements in transport and communication, as well as policies reducing barriers to international exchange. While globalization has generally improved living standards globally, there is ongoing debate about its inclusivity and impact on inequality. Global value chains encompass interconnected organizations and resources. Globalization has led to the growth of global trade and foreign direct investment, aided by advancements in transport and communication and policies reducing barriers. There is ongoing debate about the inclusivity and impact on inequality of economic integration. Global value chains, organized by multinational corporations, involve the creation and delivery of products through interconnected organizations and resources across multiple countries. More than half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods within supply chains, while over 75% of global services imports are intermediate services. Global value chains involve parts and components traded across borders multiple times, with a significant share of national exports containing foreign content. The growth of global value chains has been a key driver of globalization, connecting advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries. Global value chains (GVCs) have been a crucial driver of globalization, connecting advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries. GVCs have facilitated lower trade barriers, technological advances, faster international transport, and accelerated information flow across borders. This has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade and interpret bilateral trade balances. Trade in intermediates has made imports essential inputs into exports production, complicating the impact of policies on a nation's imports. Trade in intermediates has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it difficult to determine who benefits from global trade. Policies affecting imports also impact exports, with analysts noting shifts in global value chains that will shape future globalization. Foreign direct investment is a key driver of trade, supporting cross-border capital flows and influencing business enterprises in different countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) drives trade by creating lasting interests in businesses across borders, supporting global value chains and intra-firm trade. U.S. firms invest abroad for various reasons. Foreign direct investment (FDI) supports the expansion of inter- and intra-firm trade by U.S. firms investing abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, 59% to the host country's market, and 30% to other foreign countries. Some firms also establish operations abroad to replace exports. Greater global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about \"offshoring\" and \"outsourcing\" of manufacturing and business functions to countries with lower labor costs. Some U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities abroad to access resources like the U.S. consumer market and high-skilled labor. Greater global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about \"offshoring\" and \"outsourcing\" of manufacturing and business functions to countries with lower labor costs. U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development (R&D) abroad while outsourcing production to suppliers overseas. Economists believe globalization won't impact overall U.S. employment rate but may increase volatility in worker incomes and employment in certain sectors. Shifting manufacturing assembly abroad could reduce U.S. manufacturing jobs but boost service-related jobs. While globalization and trade liberalization are not expected to significantly impact the overall U.S. employment rate, there may be greater volatility in worker incomes and employment in specific sectors. For instance, offshoring manufacturing assembly could decrease U.S. manufacturing jobs but increase service-related jobs. Globalization also affects wealth distribution by potentially lowering wages for lower-skilled U.S. workers facing foreign competition and increasing returns to capital. Globalization has contributed to declining labor share in national income, with studies showing a 10-20% impact on U.S. wage inequality. Most-favored-nation treatment in the WTO requires equal trade treatment among member countries. Most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment in the WTO requires equal trade treatment among member countries, granting each other member country treatment at least as favorable as its most-favored trade partner. Exceptions include trade agreements outside the WTO and special treatment for developing countries. National treatment is another principle of nondiscrimination in the trading system. Trade agreements outside of the WTO allow countries to grant additional preferences to each other, with special treatment for developing nations. National treatment ensures non-discrimination between domestic and foreign products, services, and intellectual property rights. Most-favored nation (MFN) status, known as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) in the US, requires equal treatment of trading partners. Cuba and North Korea do not have PNTR with the US. In practice, countries with most-favored nation (MFN) or permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status receive lower duty rates on imports compared to those without this status. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries that did not have it at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further denies PNTR status to countries that restrict freedom of emigration. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries without it at the time of enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR to countries restricting emigration. MFN treatment must be extended immediately to all WTO members. PNTR is required for full benefits of WTO membership. HTSUS determines tariffs on imported goods based on commodity classification. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) determines tariffs on imported goods based on commodity classification using the Harmonized System (HS) with 1,200 product headings grouped into 96 chapters. Each heading is further divided into subheadings at the four-digit and six-digit levels, providing detailed product categories. For example, the 2-digit chapter 08 represents \"edible fruits and nuts,\" with citrus fruits identified by a specific 4-digit HS code. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) categorizes imported goods based on the Harmonized System (HS) with 1,200 product headings grouped into 96 chapters. Each heading is further divided into subheadings at the four-digit and six-digit levels, totaling 5,000 separate groups of goods at the 6-digit level. HS codes are standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level, with the HTSUS further subdividing each subheading into 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines unique to the United States. Rules of origin (ROO) determine the \"nationality\" of imported products and are crucial for determining admissibility. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) categorizes imported goods based on the Harmonized System (HS) with 1,200 product headings grouped into 96 chapters. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the HTS. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code. Rules of origin (ROO) determine the \"nationality\" of imported products, impacting admissibility, duty rates, and eligibility for trade programs. Determining a product's origin can be complex due to global sourcing of parts. The U.S. negotiates different ROO within its free trade agreements to ensure only eligible partners receive tariff benefits. In today's global economy, determining the origin of products can be complex as goods are assembled with parts from multiple countries. The United States negotiates rules of origin (ROO) in its free trade agreements to ensure only eligible partners receive tariff benefits. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in the apparel industry requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners, sparking debate among Congress members and industry stakeholders. Global trade plays a crucial role in the economy. The yarn-forward rule in the apparel industry, part of free trade agreements, is debated among Congress members and industry stakeholders. Global trade is vital for the economy, with trade growth outpacing GDP growth historically but slowing in recent years. Global trade growth historically outpaced GDP growth, but slowed in recent years due to various factors. However, trade growth rebounded in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure, marking the strongest rate since 2011. The IMF and the WTO are optimistic about the improving global economic outlook. Global trade growth rebounded in 2017, increasing from 2% in 2016 to above 5%, driven by cyclical factors like increased investment and consumption expenditure. The IMF and WTO projected a trade growth rebound for 2018 and 2019, but now expect a slowdown due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Analysts suggest that restrictive trade measures are affecting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors, harming businesses' outlooks and investment plans. Global trade growth is expected to slow due to uncertainty and restrictive trade policy measures imposed by the United States and its major trading partners. Analysts believe recent policy announcements have harmed businesses' outlooks and investment plans. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The top-five largest trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. U.S. exports and imports combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. The U.S. is a major global trader, with exports and imports equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. Various organizations assess the competitiveness of the U.S. economy, ranking first in the Global Competitiveness Index. U.S. exports have grown over 40% in the past decade, while imports have grown over 20%. Trade relative to GDP has risen significantly since 1960. In 2017, the United States exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. U.S. exports have grown more than 40% in the past decade, while imports have grown more than 20%. Trade relative to GDP has risen significantly since 1960. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. The United States has significant trade relationships with China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without free trade agreements, complicating the interpretation of trade data due to global value chains and intra-firm trade. The growth of global value chains and intra-firm trade has made it challenging to interpret trade data for the U.S. economy. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the source of resources used in production or who benefits from trade. For example, products like iPhones, developed by U.S. firm Apple, are assembled in China using components from various countries. This results in the full value of imports being attributed to China, even though the value added there is minimal. Apple benefits the most from the profits generated by the sale of its products. The growth of global value chains and intra-firm trade has complicated the interpretation of trade data for the U.S. economy. For instance, products like iPhones, developed by Apple in the United States, are assembled in China using components from various countries. This results in an inflated bilateral trade deficit between the two countries, as the full value of imports is attributed to China, despite most of the value added activities occurring in the United States. Apple benefits the most from the profits generated by the sale of its products. The trade deficit between the U.S. and China is inflated due to the attribution of the full value of imported products to China. \"Trade in value-added\" (TiVA) estimates show that the deficit would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if trade flows were measured differently. The trade deficit refers to the balance of trade in goods and services, with deficits occurring when a country's imports exceed its exports. The trade deficit refers to the balance of trade in goods and services, with deficits occurring when a country imports more than it exports. The United States has had annual trade deficits since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017, driven mainly by goods trade. The United States has had trade deficits annually since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017. The deficit is mainly driven by goods trade, with a deficit of $807.5 billion. The U.S. also has a services trade surplus of $255.2 billion. The current account deficit in 2017 was $449.1 billion, down from its peak in 2006. The United States has had a trade deficit since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017. The current account deficit in 2017 was $449.1 billion, down from its peak in 2006. The deficit is driven by goods trade, with a surplus in services. The U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports, leading to the trade deficit. The U.S. global trade deficit reflects that the United States consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports. Economists attribute the deficit to an imbalance between domestic savings and total investment, with low domestic savings leading to borrowing from countries with excess savings. This borrowing fuels economic growth, boosting consumption and demand for imports, resulting in a trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is fueled by borrowing from countries like China, enabling higher economic growth and increased consumption. Factors like differences in economic growth and the role of the dollar also impact the deficit. Foreign investors seek dollar-denominated assets, sustaining the deficit by financing the lack of savings in the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit is sustained by borrowing from countries like China and foreign investors seeking dollar-denominated assets. The deficit can continue as long as funds are available to finance the lack of savings in the U.S. economy. The U.S. current account deficit relative to GDP has declined from a historic high in 2006 to 2.3% in 2017, aligning with trends since the mid-1980s. The U.S. current account deficit relative to GDP reached a historic high of 5.8% in 2006 but has since decreased to 2.3% in 2017. The United States, along with the United Kingdom and Canada, had the largest current account deficits as a percentage of GDP, while countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had the largest surpluses. Policymakers often use U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China as an indicator of trade relationships. The U.S. current account deficit has decreased from a historic high in 2006 to 2.3% in 2017. The largest current account deficits as a percentage of GDP were seen in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, while countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had the largest surpluses. Policymakers often view U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China as indicators of trade relationships, with concerns about unfair trade practices affecting trade volumes. Reducing protectionist measures in certain countries could potentially increase U.S. exports. The global U.S. trade deficit is largely due to low U.S. savings, not high tariffs. Reduction of protectionist measures may increase U.S. exports, but overall trade deficit may remain unchanged due to increased demand for imports. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers. The reduction or imposition of protectionist trade measures in one country may lead to trade diversion, shifting trade to another country, without significantly impacting the overall trade deficit. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development, raw materials abundance, and technological change. Complex supply chain relationships with certain trading partners, like China, contribute to bilateral trade deficits. Complex supply chain relationships with trading partners like China often result in trade deficits. These deficits can lead to adjustments in a country's exchange rate, causing a surplus of U.S. dollars to flow abroad. The excess supply of dollars tends to lower its value relative to other currencies, making imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers. This gradual process should eventually help reduce the trade deficit. The excess supply of dollars can lower its value, making imports costlier for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers. The dollar's global status as a reserve currency and safe haven for investments, especially from countries like China, can lead to appreciation, making U.S. exports more expensive. Foreign governments intervene to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar by buying dollars and investing in the U.S. When foreign governments exchange their currency for U.S. dollars to buy U.S. Treasury securities, the dollar appreciates, making U.S. exports more expensive. Some analysts believe that past currency interventions by countries like China to hold down their currency values have affected global trade balances. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the United States borrowing from abroad and accumulating debt. The impact of borrowing to finance imports depends on whether the funds are used for productive investments with high returns. Trade deficits reflect the savings/investment shortfall, with the United States borrowing from abroad and accumulating debt. The impact of borrowing to finance imports depends on whether the funds are used for productive investments with high returns or for current consumption. Borrowing for investments can lead to higher economic growth, while borrowing for consumer purchases pushes repayment to future generations without raising the ability to finance those repayments. Borrowing to finance consumer purchases pushes repayment to future generations without raising the ability to finance those repayments. A rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil. Attempting to reduce the trade deficit without addressing macroeconomic imbalances could negatively affect economic growth in the long run. Many economists argue that reducing the U.S. trade deficit without addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy by reducing economic growth. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include boosting domestic savings or reducing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates and ensuring other countries do not devalue their currencies artificially are also options. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tools for balancing trade. In 2017, the U.S. exported $1.3 trillion in goods and imported $2.0 trillion. In 2017, the United States exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods and imported $2.0 trillion, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion. U.S. manufactures accounted for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. The top exports and imports included transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have transformed U.S. manufacturing in certain industries. The share of U.S. exports fell by 4 percentage points over the past decade, with services export share expanding. The manufactures share of U.S. imports increased by 4 percentage points. Top exports and imports included transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have reshaped U.S. manufacturing, leading to the outsourcing of labor-intensive activities and emphasizing advanced technology in production. Reports of factory closings and layoffs have fueled the perception of a shrinking U.S. manufacturing sector. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a decline in employment but an increase in output due to increased productivity. Factory closings and layoffs have contributed to the perception of a shrinking sector, despite manufacturing remaining a significant component of the economy. Since 1980, U.S. manufacturing output has increased significantly, reflecting higher productivity and requiring fewer workers. Despite a decline in its share of GDP, manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy. Employment in manufacturing has decreased since 1979 but has been increasing annually since 2010, accounting for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment in 2017 compared to 20.7% in 1980. The value-added of services increased from 55% to 70% of GDP. U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising annually since 2010. Employment in manufacturing accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment in 2017, down from 20.7% in 1980. The decline in manufacturing employment is a global trend, influenced by technology, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic factors. Trade's role in this shift is a topic of debate. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment is a global trend influenced by technology, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic factors. The role of trade in this shift is widely debated, with some attributing job losses to increased imports from China while others argue that job gains in services offset the decline. A fundamental restructuring of the U.S. manufacturing sector was already underway before China joined the WTO. The U.S. manufacturing sector has undergone a fundamental restructuring over the past two decades, with some attributing job losses to increased imports from China. Despite a decline in global manufacturing value-added, the U.S. remains a top global manufacturer, exporting $138 billion in agricultural goods in 2017. Manufacturing is a significant component of the U.S. economy, accounting for nearly 70% of private-sector research and development and nearly 60% of exports. In 2017, the United States exported $138 billion in agricultural goods and imported $121 billion, creating a trade surplus of $17 billion. U.S. agricultural exports accounted for 6% of total U.S. exports of goods and services and 4% of total U.S. imports. Agriculture's share of U.S. exports has fallen slightly below the average of 8% over the past decade, while the import share remains on trend. Foreign markets are a major outlet for many agricultural goods, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production by value. Exports of agricultural goods in the United States have fallen slightly below the average of 8% over the past decade, while imports remain steady. Foreign markets play a significant role in absorbing U.S. agricultural output, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production by value. Additionally, imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices have contributed significantly to U.S. food consumption in recent years. Services, including a wide range of economic activities, not only serve as end-use products but also support the overall economy. Services encompass a variety of economic activities that support the economy, including audiovisual, construction, computer services, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, financial services, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications. These services not only serve as end-use products but also facilitate the functioning of the economy by enabling the movement of goods, providing e-commerce channels, and offering financial support for manufacturing. Foreign barriers may hinder the full potential of U.S. trade in services, with obstacles differing from those faced by goods suppliers. Services trade barriers are often different from those faced by goods suppliers, with restrictions occurring within the importing country as \"behind the border\" barriers. Discriminatory regulations may favor domestic service providers over foreign ones, hindering the ability to establish a commercial presence or temporary movement of providers. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with exports totaling $798 billion and imports at $542 billion. Services trade accounts for 34% of total U.S. exports and 19% of total U.S. imports, playing a significant role in the economy by contributing to 79% of GDP and 82% of private sector full-time employment. Unlike goods trade, the U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports. Services trade in the U.S. accounts for 34% of exports and 19% of imports, playing a crucial role in the economy by contributing to 79% of GDP and 82% of private sector full-time employment. The U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports, leading to a trade surplus of $255 billion in services in 2017. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to the lack of value-added measurement, with services inputs like R&D, design, and business services playing a significant role in the value chain. The value of services inputs in trade is often underestimated, with R&D, design, and business services playing a crucial role in the value chain. As manufacturing and agriculture become more complex, their consumption of value-added services also increases. Digital trade, including online shopping and communication channels, not only involves end-products but also enhances productivity and competitiveness. Digital trade encompasses a wide range of activities such as online shopping, communication channels, and financial services, facilitating economic activity and enhancing productivity. Trade barriers in digital trade can be tariff or nontariff, with nontariff barriers often taking the form of localization requirements that restrict the flow of commercial data. Trade constraints can be classified as tariff or nontariff barriers, with nontariff barriers often in the form of localization requirements that restrict the flow of commercial data, affecting firms' offerings and operations. Data transfer regulations, such as data localization barriers, may limit the type of services a firm can sell or how it can communicate and share data internationally. The United States has historically focused on supporting economic growth through trade policies that reduce barriers and enforce trade commitments. Data transfer regulations, like data localization barriers, can limit firms' ability to sell services internationally and communicate with subsidiaries. The United States has historically focused on supporting economic growth through trade policies that reduce barriers and enforce trade commitments. U.S. trade policy aims to advance strategic goals by supporting economic development, strengthening alliances, and extending influence abroad. Key objectives are outlined in an annual trade policy agenda by the U.S. Trade Representative, including supporting national security and preserving sovereignty. The U.S. focuses on trade policies to support economic growth, strengthen alliances, and extend influence abroad. The current Administration aims to pursue trade policies that support national security, negotiate better trade deals, enforce trade laws, and reform the multilateral trading system. Key trade functions include formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. trade policy through legislation. The U.S. government's trade policy involves formulating, coordinating, and enforcing trade agreements and laws. Congress collaborates with the executive branch on trade agreements, while the USTR and various agencies implement trade policy through interagency coordination. The Commerce Department oversees key trade programs. The USTR plays a crucial role in trade policy as the President's main advisor and chief negotiator. Other agencies like the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture also have specific responsibilities in trade. Congress holds the primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution. Congress is designated as the primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution. It has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among states, lay taxes, and make necessary laws. Congress enacts tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and approves reciprocal trade agreements. U.S. trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress, including laws governing tariffs, nontariff barriers, trade remedies, and import/export policies. Congress also sets trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority. Trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress, including laws authorizing trade programs, tariffs, nontariff barriers, trade remedies, and import/export policies. Congress sets trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority and conducts oversight hearings on trade programs and agreements. Certain powers are delegated to the President to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action regarding trade policy. The President is delegated powers by Congress to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action regarding trade policy. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to reduce tariffs within approved levels and implement new tariffs without additional legislation. This authority was renewed periodically until the Trade Act of 1974, which broadened the mandate for the executive branch to open markets and negotiate international trade norms. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded the executive branch's authority to negotiate international trade norms and open markets. Congressional committees like the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee oversee trade matters, with subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees may also be involved in trade agreements and policies within their jurisdiction. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide consultation and advice. The House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking Committees have jurisdiction over export controls and trade relationships. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting and committee participation. The Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations (SAG), chaired by the Finance Committee chair, can access trade negotiating documents. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting, committee participation, testimony, letters to USTR, and informal influence. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites approval of trade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements that require changes in U.S. law. TPA ensures a guaranteed, up-or-down vote on implementing legislation with no amendments, as long as certain requirements are met. Negotiations for trade agreements must align with TPA objectives and involve consultations with Congress and stakeholders. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements that require changes in U.S. law. TPA ensures negotiations align with specific objectives and involve consultations with Congress and stakeholders. The most recent TPA legislation, signed into law on June 29, 2015 (P.L. 114-26), applies to trade agreements notified to Congress before July 1, 2021. Congress will consider TPA without amendments, last renewed in 2015 (P.L. 114-26) and applicable to trade agreements before July 1, 2021. The executive branch handles trade policy, including negotiations, customs enforcement, budget proposals, and export/import policies, under the President's direction. The executive branch, under the President's direction, negotiates, implements, and monitors U.S. trade agreements, enforces customs, collects duties, and administers trade laws. The USTR, the chief trade policy adviser, develops and enforces trade policies, negotiates agreements, and reports to Congress annually. Congress established the USTR in 1962. The USTR, established in 1962, is responsible for developing and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. It reports annually to Congress on the President's trade policy agenda and foreign trade barriers. Various departments and agencies within the executive branch handle delegated trade functions. The USTR is responsible for U.S. trade policy and negotiations, with various departments and agencies handling delegated trade functions. Key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. The USTR leads trade negotiations and policy decisions, often requiring a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee to implement this process. The USTR leads trade negotiations and policy decisions, involving various departments like Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee to facilitate this multidepartment interagency process. The President is responsible for overseeing the trade advisory committee system. The President influences trade legislation, signs trade laws, and makes decisions on trade policies. This includes requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and meeting with foreign leaders to influence trade relations. The political environment requires direct participation in various trade policy areas, including requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and deciding on import restrictions. The President can influence trade relations through meetings with foreign leaders. The private sector and stakeholders play a role in U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The advisory system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974 consists of 28 committees with about 700 citizen advisors. It is administered by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement and includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, five general policy advisory committees, and 20 technical advisory committees. These committees ensure that U.S. public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs, providing information and advice on negotiating objectives for trade agreements. The advisory system, established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974, includes committees to ensure U.S. public and private sector views are considered in trade policies. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups shape U.S. trade policy through testimonies before congressional committees and government bodies. Stakeholders provide assessments on the potential impact of trade negotiations. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups play a significant role in shaping U.S. trade policy by providing assessments and testimonies to government bodies and congressional committees. They are also involved in lobbying efforts to promote their interests in trade policies and agreements. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, with various goods and services being tradeable across borders. The executive branch plays a key role in promoting U.S. trade interests through trade policies and agreements. Trade encompasses a wide range of goods and services that can be traded internationally. Decisions on trade agreements and antidumping cases can impact employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for U.S. consumers. Groups also seek greater market access in other countries, with trade agreements increasingly addressing non-tariff issues like intellectual property. Groups representing various stakeholders, including businesses, farmers, workers, consumers, and public interest groups, strive to ensure their views on trade policy decisions are represented. Legal challenges in federal court may be brought by importers, exporters, domestic manufacturers, and other parties to appeal governmental actions and decisions concerning trade, such as customs classification and antidumping cases. Public interest groups advocate for their views on trade policy decisions. Legal challenges in federal court can be brought by various parties to appeal governmental actions regarding trade, including customs classification, antidumping cases, Section 201 safeguards, Section 232 national security investigations, and state economic sanctions. The federal government can also initiate legal proceedings to enforce customs laws and statutory restrictions on imports and exports. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review. The federal government can enforce customs laws and statutory restrictions on imports and exports through legal proceedings. Some trade statutes may restrict judicial review, such as in AD and CVD proceedings and actions related to WTO and free trade agreements. Court decisions, particularly in the U.S. Court of International Trade, can impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations of statutory mandates and executive branch actions. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over various trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. It can significantly impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations of statutory mandates and executive branch actions. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters such as customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. It consists of nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters. Statutory provisions related to the USCIT can be found in specific sections. The United States negotiates trade agreements for various reasons, including economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security objectives. These objectives aim to reduce barriers, increase market access for U.S. exporters, gain competitive advantages, and encourage trading partners to liberalize their trade and investment regimes. The United States negotiates trade agreements to gain competitive advantages over foreign competitors, increase access to lower-cost imports, encourage trading partners to liberalize their trade and investment regimes, and strengthen alliances. Trade agreements are categorized as multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization, free trade agreements negotiated outside the WTO, and bilateral or regional FTAs. Trade agreements can be multilateral, involving all 164 WTO members, or free trade agreements (FTAs) negotiated outside the WTO. FTAs can be bilateral, regional (involving three or more countries), or plurilateral (involving more than two countries but not all WTO members). The US has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, while globally, nearly 300 trade agreements are in force. U.S. FTA partners are mostly small countries. The United States has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, with the majority of its FTA partners being small, developing countries. While some major trading partners like Canada and Mexico are covered by FTAs, only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners. Over 99% of U.S. trade is with WTO member countries, with 65% of U.S. trade being with WTO members without an FTA. The Trump Administration has shifted its approach to trade negotiations by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January 2017. The Trump Administration has shifted its trade policy by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January 2017 and focusing on bilateral trade negotiations. They have renegotiated two FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the USMCA agreement signed in November 2018. The United States signed the USMCA agreement on November 30, 2018, under TPA procedures, allowing for expedited consideration by Congress. Amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA were also negotiated, including the delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff. Additionally, new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom are being considered for negotiation in early 2019. The United States signed the USMCA agreement and negotiated amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA, including the delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff. New trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom are being considered for negotiation in early 2019. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive, covering tariff reductions, services trade barriers, foreign investment rules, intellectual property rights, government procurement markets, labor standards, and environmental protections. The U.S. seeks to establish new trading rules beyond those in the WTO. The United States has over 50 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries, focusing on promoting trade and investment through consultations on mutual economic interests. The U.S. seeks to establish new trading rules in recent negotiations, including issues like digital trade and state-owned enterprises. The USTR leads TIFA talks and can establish joint ministerial-level councils with TIFA partners. The USTR leads Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks with over 50 developing countries to promote trade and investment. TIFAs do not require congressional approval and can lead to further negotiations like Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 to govern international trade for 47 years. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 as part of the post-WWII effort to build a stable international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The core principles of GATT focused on lowering tariffs and applying them in a nondiscriminatory manner. Despite its enforcement mechanisms being viewed as ineffective, GATT led to a significant reduction in tariffs and trade barriers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 to administer trade rules and agreements among its 164 member countries, including the United States. It aims to eliminate barriers, create nondiscriminatory rules, and facilitate trade liberalization negotiations and dispute resolution. The WTO succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which focused on lowering tariffs and promoting nondiscriminatory trade practices. The WTO, established in 1995, governs trade rules and agreements among 164 member countries, including the US. It succeeded the GATT and oversees agreements for trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights, and conducts negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda. The WTO oversees trade agreements among 164 member countries, including the US, and conducts negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda. The last major negotiation began in 2001 but has been stalled since 2015. No major deliverables were announced at the latest WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2017. Members committed to progress on talks like fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, while other areas remain stalled. The WTO's effectiveness in trade negotiations has been questioned since the Doha Round collapse. Members are exploring reforms to improve the organization's role in global trade and dispute resolution. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO is considering reforms to enhance its role in global trade and dispute resolution. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, which could lead to the dispute settlement system ceasing to function by late 2019. A WTO member can start dispute settlement proceedings to challenge another member's trade practices that violate a WTO agreement. The process involves consultations, followed by a dispute panel decision that can be appealed to the WTO Appellate Body. If a violation is found, the defending member must remove the measure or face retaliatory action. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO dispute cases. The WTO allows members to request authorization for retaliatory action or seek compensation in dispute settlement cases. The United States has been actively involved in WTO disputes, with many pending cases challenging recent tariff measures. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation of findings. Compliance actions are determined by USTR in response to successful challenges. The United States may pay compensation to complainant countries instead of changing U.S. rules or regulations in response to successful challenges in WTO disputes. U.S. generally seeks to comply with WTO decisions to ensure other members also comply. U.S. FTAs establish procedures for compliance actions. The United States may pay compensation to complainant countries instead of changing U.S. rules in response to successful WTO disputes. U.S. FTAs also have procedures for resolving disputes, aiming to first resolve them through consultations before resorting to a panel for adjudication. Compliance with panel decisions is expected, with possible trade benefit suspension for non-compliance. State-state dispute settlement is not frequently used under U.S. FTAs. The United States resolves disputes in its Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) through consultations before adjudication by a panel. Non-compliance can lead to trade benefit suspension. State-state dispute settlement is uncommon in U.S. FTAs, with most disputes resolved under WTO rules. Additionally, FTAs include investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms. NAFTA has a unique binational panel system for dispute resolution. The United States resolves disputes in its Free Trade Agreements through consultations before adjudication by a panel. Most U.S. FTAs also have investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms. NAFTA has a unique binational panel system for dispute resolution. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from eligible developing countries. Congress has created six programs since 1974. Since 1974, Congress has established six trade preference programs, including GSP, APTA, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. In 2017, $21 billion worth of imports entered the U.S. under GSP out of $220 billion total imports from GSP countries. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including intellectual property protections. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) covers about 3,500 products from designated beneficiary developing countries and 1,500 additional products from least-developed countries. In 2017, $21 billion worth of imports entered the U.S. under the program. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including intellectual property and worker rights protections. The U.S. is conducting eligibility reviews for several GSP beneficiary countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration in international trade, with about $1.2 billion invested in 651 TCB activities in FY2016. The U.S. provides assistance, such as funding and training, to help developing countries participate in international trade. In FY2016, $1.2 billion was invested in 651 TCB activities across 134 countries. The U.S. government sees TCB as crucial for countries to negotiate trade agreements, implement reforms, and improve their capacity for increased trade. USAID is the main agency for TCB activities, with support also from the Millennium Challenge Corporation for infrastructure projects. The U.S. government provides assistance for Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to help developing countries improve their trade capabilities. Various agencies, including USAID, MCC, Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency, are involved in TCB efforts. Tariffs, historically used for revenue collection, are now administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at ports of entry, generating $32 billion in 2016. The United States historically used tariffs for revenue collection, but now relies on other means for generating revenue. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administers tariff collection at ports of entry, collecting $32 billion in 2016. The U.S. has reduced or eliminated many tariffs through trade negotiations to promote global trade liberalization and support economic prosperity. Congress authorized the President to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions bilaterally starting in 1934. The United States has reduced tariffs through trade negotiations to promote global trade liberalization and economic prosperity. Global tariffs fell to less than 7% on average by 2012, with U.S. tariffs at 3.3% in 2016. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain imported goods. As of 2016, U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top global economies. About 70% of products enter the U.S. duty-free. The Trump Administration has raised tariffs on some imports, using trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices. Trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duty laws are frequently used to address unfair trade practices. These laws are administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, patent and copyright infringements, and counterfeit goods, all while complying with U.S. WTO obligations. Trade remedy laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are used to address unfair trade practices. These laws comply with U.S. WTO obligations and focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, patent and copyright infringements, and counterfeit goods. Supporters argue that these laws are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers, while others are concerned about potential inefficiencies and disguised protectionism. Antidumping is the most commonly used trade remedy law. Antidumping (AD) is a frequently used U.S. trade remedy law that addresses unfair trade practices such as dumping, where goods are sold at lower prices in export markets. This can lead to market share gains, deter competition, or reduce industrial overcapacity. AD duties are assessed when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the U.S., causing material injury to domestic industries. Some view AD/CVD actions as necessary to protect industries and workers, while others see them as potential protectionism that raises prices on imported goods. Antidumping (AD) laws in the U.S. address unfair trade practices like dumping, where goods are sold at lower prices to gain market share, deter competition, or reduce industrial overcapacity. AD duties are imposed when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value,\" causing harm to domestic industries. The U.S. has 354 AD orders in place, with over one-third targeting China. Countervailing duty (CVD) laws are also commonly used to offset competitive advantages from subsidies received by foreign manufacturers. The CVD law in the U.S. aims to offset competitive advantages from subsidies received by foreign manufacturers. It is designed to counteract the net amount of the subsidy and is imposed on imports of subsidized goods. The U.S. has 113 CVD orders in place, with nearly half targeting China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to temporarily restrict imports causing serious harm to domestic industries. The CVD law in the U.S. aims to counteract subsidies received by foreign manufacturers, with 113 orders in place targeting China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restrict imports causing harm to domestic industries through safeguard actions. The ITC conducts investigations initiated by petitions to determine if imports are causing serious injury, making recommendations to the President for temporary relief. In the U.S., safeguard investigations can be initiated without allegations of unfair trade practices. The ITC investigates if imports are causing serious injury to domestic industries and recommends temporary relief to the President. Under the Trump Administration, safeguard measures were imposed on solar cells and large residential washing machines in 2018. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 34 cases resulting in affirmative decisions. The ITC conducted 73 safeguard investigations from 1975 to 2001, resulting in 34 affirmative decisions. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies for investigations. The Trade Expansion Act allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with other agencies for investigations. Section 232 specifies factors for consideration, with the President having discretion to impose tariffs or quotas. In 2018, tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum imports due to national security concerns. Section 232 allows for tariffs or quotas to counter adverse effects, with limited restrictions. In 2018, tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum imports for national security reasons. Section 301 enforces U.S. rights under trade agreements and addresses unfair barriers to exports, such as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. The Trade Act of 1974, as amended, allows the US to enforce its rights under trade agreements and address unfair barriers to exports, including inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. Section 301 deals with foreign acts that violate trade agreements or unjustifiably restrict US commerce. Cases can be initiated by petition or by USTR, which seeks a negotiated settlement with the trading partner. If no resolution is reached, USTR may retaliate, often through tariffs. The USTR seeks negotiated settlements with trading partners to address trade barriers or practices. If no resolution is reached, tariffs may be imposed. The \"Special 301\" provision identifies countries with inadequate intellectual property rights protection. USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases since 1974, retaliating in 16 instances. The USTR has a three-tier list of countries with inadequate IPR regimes, including a \"Priority Foreign Country\" designation for the most serious cases. Since 1974, 125 Section 301 cases have been initiated, with retaliatory actions taken in 16 instances. In 2017, an investigation into China's IPR technology policies was launched, leading to increased tariffs on imports. The Trump Administration increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China due to unfair practices. China responded with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products. Both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China had not changed its unfair practices. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate structural changes in IP and technology issues within 90 days. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days at the 2018 G-20 Leaders' Summit. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. products, and the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases under Section 301. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S., increasingly used for IPR enforcement. The Tariff Act of 1930, specifically Section 337, prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S. It is increasingly used for intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement, targeting imports that infringe U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other protected rights. The International Trade Commission (ITC) is responsible for Section 337 investigations, and if a violation is found, exclusion or cease-and-desist orders may be issued. Proof of injury is not required for enforcement. The Tariff Act of 1930, under Section 337, prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S., focusing on intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement. The International Trade Commission (ITC) handles Section 337 investigations and can issue exclusion or cease-and-desist orders without requiring proof of injury. Additionally, Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs offer federal aid to workers and firms affected by trade, with TAA for Workers (TAAW) being the largest program. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, provide assistance to workers affected by foreign competition. The largest program, TAA for Workers (TAAW), received $790 million in FY2019 for career services, training, and income support. Benefits are administered through state workforce and unemployment systems. Smaller TAA programs also exist for firms and farmers. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide funding for career services, training, and income support for workers affected by foreign competition. Benefits are administered through state workforce and unemployment systems. TAA aims to offset the challenges faced by firms and workers due to trade liberalization, offering a less disruptive option for those impacted. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is justified for economic efficiency, equity, and generating support for international trade. Critics argue it is costly, reduces incentives to adjust, and may not be equitable. Some believe TAA programs are not extensive enough to be effective. The Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 was enacted to support these efforts. The Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation administer finance programs to assist U.S. firms in exporting and investing in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency to succeed OPIC, with a focus on U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. U.S. trade financing aims to create a level playing field against foreign firms with subsidized financing. The International Trade Administration supports U.S. exports, especially by small and medium-sized companies, through various services. U.S. trade financing aims to create a level playing field against foreign firms with subsidized financing. The Ex-Im Bank provides loans, guarantees, and insurance to finance U.S. exports to counter similar activities by foreign governments. Despite its reauthorization, the Ex-Im Bank has not been fully operational. The Ex-Im Bank operates under a renewable statutory charter and has faced operational constraints due to unfilled board positions. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over the role of government in export financing. Export controls have been controversial, balancing national security goals with economic reasons. The United States restricts exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons through various acts and authorities, including the Arms Export Control Act, Export Controls Act of 2018, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Export controls are used to limit trade with sanctioned countries and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, certain nuclear materials, and items related to weapons proliferation. Export controls are administered by multiple departments and require various licenses. The Export Control Act of 2018 provides legislative authority for implementing dual-use export controls, replacing the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Control Act of 2018, Subtitle B, Part I, replaced the Export Administration Act of 1979, giving the President broad authority to implement dual-use export controls. This law allows the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial to national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications, such as nuclear materials, electronics, and lasers. Licenses for exporting these goods are issued by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. Dual-use goods are commodities, software, or technologies with civilian and military applications. Examples include nuclear materials, microorganisms, electronics, computers, lasers, and sensors. Exports are licensed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security based on technical characteristics, destination, end use, and end user activities. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets like real estate or controlling interest in an enterprise from another country. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) includes purchasing foreign equities, bonds, loans to foreign residents, or opening foreign bank accounts. FDI entails a long-term commitment. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from 1990 to 2017, increasing exports from $4 trillion to $23 trillion. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets like real estate or controlling interest in an enterprise from another country, while foreign portfolio investment (FPI) includes purchasing foreign equities, bonds, loans, or opening foreign bank accounts. FDI stimulates direct employment for the host country, while portfolio investments are highly liquid and can be withdrawn easily. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes such as humanitarian assistance and foreign aid. Official capital flows, including direct, portfolio, and other investments, have grown significantly from around $1 trillion to about $4 trillion annually from 1990 to 2017. There was a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007, showing substantial growth since the 1990s. Additionally, there was an increase in foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives markets, which facilitate trade in foreign exchange and other assets. These markets impact capital flows but are not directly related to balance of payments transactions. The growth of official capital flows, including direct, portfolio, and other investments, has increased significantly from around $1 trillion to about $4 trillion annually from 1990 to 2017. There has also been an explosion in foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives markets, impacting capital flows but not directly related to balance of payments transactions. The total daily trading of foreign currencies was more than $5.1 trillion in 2016, with firms investing abroad to increase profits, influenced by factors such as special knowledge or managerial abilities possessed by multinational corporations. In 2016, daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion. Firms invest abroad to boost profits, driven by factors like special knowledge or managerial abilities possessed by multinational corporations. Major determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) include competitive advantages, access to low-cost resources, and improved efficiency or market share. FDI supports the development of global value chains by sourcing production globally. Multinational corporations (MNCs) invest abroad for various reasons, including gaining access to resources, improving efficiency, and expanding market share. FDI also allows firms to operate close to customers with different preferences, access skilled labor, and engage in mergers and acquisitions for global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States being the largest source. According to UNCTAD, global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion. The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI, followed by Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, and Singapore. Developing Asia received the largest share of global FDI inflows, followed by Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. The United States is the largest recipient of FDI, with developing Asia leading in global FDI inflows. FDI to and from the United States has significantly increased over the past few decades, with the stock of U.S. FDI abroad rising to $6.0 trillion and FDI in the United States increasing to $4.0 trillion by 2017. The largest destinations for U.S. FDI outflows included the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. The largest sources of FDI inflows included the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Germany. The stock of U.S. FDI abroad increased to $4.0 trillion by 2017, with major destinations including the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-technology, finance, and services sectors, while inward FDI is primarily in manufacturing, especially chemicals and transport industries. Economists advocate for unimpeded international capital flows like FDI for mutual economic benefits. The largest share of U.S. inward FDI is in the manufacturing sector, particularly chemicals and transport industries. Economists support international capital flows like FDI as they benefit both the home and host countries. Direct investment allows firms to leverage their competitive advantages, acquire new skills, and strengthen their position in foreign markets. Host countries benefit from FDI by adding to their capital stock, improving skills, and bringing technological advances. Direct investment, whether inward or outward, brings various benefits such as a strengthened competitive position, higher employee skills, increased firm incomes, and technological advances. It contributes to capital formation, a more competitive business environment, and productivity growth. Additionally, FDI promotes international trade and global economic integration, with established MNCs operating within global value chains. In the U.S., foreign firms' affiliates employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion, and imported $649.9 billion in goods in 2016. Foreign firms investing in the United States play a significant role in trade and production, employing 7.1 million workers and contributing $894.0 billion to U.S. GDP in 2016. Concerns exist that U.S. firms investing abroad may lead to job losses domestically, but tracking such activities is challenging. U.S. firms invest abroad to send manufacturing and jobs overseas, supplanting U.S. production and exports, potentially reducing employment and wages in the United States. Most outward FDI is in high-income developed countries, with no conclusive evidence that it leads to fewer jobs or lower incomes for Americans. Loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs is seen as a result of sector restructuring. Most economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes for Americans.
