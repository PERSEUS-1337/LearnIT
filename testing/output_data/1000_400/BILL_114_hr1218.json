    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs. Research shows that investing in physical activity can significantly reduce medical expenses, and offering financial incentives can motivate more Americans to be physically active. The United States could reduce medical expenses by $3.20 for every $1 invested in physical activity. Research shows that financial incentives can motivate 2 in 5 Americans to be more active. The U.S. ranks last in preventing obesity-related deaths globally. Engaging children in physical activities early can impact their long-term health. The purpose of the Act is to promote health, prevent diseases related to obesity, encourage healthier lifestyles, and provide financial incentives for healthy behavior. The Act aims to promote health, prevent diseases related to obesity, and encourage healthier lifestyles by providing financial incentives and increasing access to physical fitness activities. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care under SEC. 3. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code allows for qualified sports and fitness expenses to be considered as amounts paid for medical care. This includes membership at a fitness facility, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for such programs. Qualified sports and fitness expenses include amounts paid for fitness facility membership, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for such programs. There is an overall dollar limitation of $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint filers or heads of household. The amount treated as qualified sports and fitness expenses for a taxpayer in a taxable year is limited to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers or heads of household). A fitness facility is defined as a facility providing physical exercise instruction or facilities for physical fitness, not owned by a private club. The provision defines a fitness facility as a facility that provides physical exercise instruction or facilities for physical fitness, not owned by a private club, and compliant with anti-discrimination laws. The provision specifies that exercise videos, books, and similar materials are treated as qualified expenses if they provide instruction in physical exercise. Additionally, sports and fitness equipment expenses are only qualified if they are exclusively used for fitness participation. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be exclusively used for fitness activities, not apparel or footwear, and not exceed $250 for sports equipment. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, including rules for programs with components other than physical exercise or activity. Travel and accommodations are considered as other components."
