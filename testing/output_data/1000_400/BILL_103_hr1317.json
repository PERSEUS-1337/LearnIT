    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Franchise Data and Public Information Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds a lack of reliable statistical information on franchise businesses despite their growing importance in the American marketplace. This information gap hinders objective investigations into franchise failures. Despite the lack of reliable statistics on franchise failures, a large amount of promotional material and articles present franchises as uniformly successful and low-risk. Inaccurate or misleading statistical information is often attributed to Federal Government agencies, leading franchisees to potentially suffer substantial losses without accurate information. The United States Department of Commerce's reports on franchise businesses prior to 1987 are often misused. Franchisees may face significant losses due to inaccurate or misleading information. The purpose of this Act is to provide comprehensive statistical information on franchising, enhance the reliability of information available to the public, and ensure prospective investors have the necessary information to make informed decisions.
