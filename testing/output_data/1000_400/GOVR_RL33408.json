    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2). NC2 involves the President's authority over military forces, government activities, and multinational actions. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President and Unified Command Commanders in exercising this authority. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is a combination of elements essential for controlling nuclear weapon operations, supporting the President's authority, and part of Continuity of Government activities. Congressional oversight is involved in reviewing plans to sustain and modernize the NCCS. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President's authority and is subject to Congressional oversight. Congress reviews Department of Defense's plans to sustain and modernize the NCCS, with potential opportunities to revisit its structure and relevance. Despite its Cold War origins, the NCCS architecture has not significantly changed since the dissolution of the USSR. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and DOD's plans for the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) present an opportunity for Congress to reassess its structure. While the NCCS still reflects its Cold War origins, the threat landscape has evolved, with potential challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran. Analysts suggest the need for robust NC2 may persist, but with a different structure. The addition of non-nuclear responses and active defenses could complicate requirements. Legacy systems may need to be retired in line with recommendations from the 2006 QDR. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and DOD's plans for the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) present an opportunity for Congress to reassess its structure. The NCCS, with its Cold War origins, may need to adapt to evolving threats from China, North Korea, or Iran. Recommendations from the 2006 QDR to retire legacy systems could clash with equities from other user agencies. The NCCS, often overlooked, plays a crucial role in the National Military Command System (NMCS) and requires modernization initiatives. The NCCS plays a crucial role in the National Military Command System (NMCS) by providing command and control of the armed forces, both nuclear and conventional. It includes various command nodes and supporting components for the National Command Authorities (NCA) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). Modernization initiatives are being reviewed for the NCCS. The National Military Command System (NMCS) includes command nodes like the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC). The NMCC is the primary location for national command and control, staffed around-the-clock, responsible for monitoring nuclear forces and military operations. The NAOC serves as a survivable option if ground-based command centers are destroyed. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) is a fleet of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. It serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities, with communications hardened against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). The NAOC is always on alert and can include a crew of up to 114 people. The Boeing 747-200B aircraft at Offutt AFB in Nebraska have communications hardened against EMP and can include a crew of up to 114 people. USSTRATCOM provides personnel and administration, while Air Combat Command manages resources. Site-R in Maryland can serve as an alternate NMCC location, and the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center at Offutt AFB can serve as a backup for emergency actions. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB in Nebraska serves as a backup for emergency actions and as the command center for the USSTRATCOM Commander. The facility is protected against EMP, has its own emergency power supply, and is staffed 24/7 by teams led by Senior Controllers. Additionally, the USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) can serve as a survivable airborne backup if the GOC is unable to fulfill its role. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) is a fleet of modified Boeing 707 aircraft with a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel. The aircraft, led by a General or Admiral, serves as a survivable airborne backup for the USSTRATCOM GOC and can communicate launch codes to ICBM launch facilities as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS). Additionally, it can act as the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. The E-6B aircraft serves as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) to communicate launch codes to ICBM facilities and as the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy submarines. It can deploy a trailing wire antenna for communication and uses various systems including VLF/LF, UHF, and EHF. The aircraft and personnel are from the Navy's Strategic Communications Wing One, based at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) is a convoy of trucks that can deploy during a crisis as a survivable road-mobile command center. The USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) is a convoy of trucks that can deploy during a crisis to serve as a survivable road-mobile backup to the USSTRATCOM GOC or ABNCP. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) has evolved to serve the President's requirements for advice and decision making for the strategic nuclear forces, including situation monitoring of the external military, political, or physical environment. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) serves the President's strategic nuclear forces advice and decision-making needs. Key functions include situation monitoring for upcoming events and tracking weather that can affect operations. Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) is crucial for detecting and analyzing potential attacks promptly. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) includes situation monitoring, Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA), and decision-making based on dual phenomenology verification of potential attacks. The TW/AA centers rely on dual phenomenology, using satellites and radars to verify attacks. Decision-making involves consulting with senior commanders and advisors, ensuring connectivity for continuous updates. Data on nuclear deterrent readiness is crucial for force management. The President consults with advisors for continuous updates on nuclear command and control, including force management and force direction to ensure nuclear surety and positive control. Data on readiness of nuclear deterrent and supporting forces is crucial for decision-making. The force management process provides key information in easily understandable formats for leadership, including nuclear surety and positive control. Force direction involves employing forces, ending hostilities, and ensuring instructions to launch nuclear weapons reach the forces. The National Military Command System connects to the forces to fulfill these expectations in the complex environment of nuclear employment. The National Military Command System must be survivable, reliable, and support rapid connectivity between decision makers and forces during critical events. It should operate effectively in extreme conditions and not generate false alarms or inaccurate information. The National Military Command System (NCCS) must be survivable, reliable, and secure. It should ensure connectivity between decision makers and forces during critical events, operate effectively without false alarms or inaccurate information, and have security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access and interference. The Nuclear Posture Review in 2001 highlighted the importance of nuclear command and control in the deterrence construct. Congress mandated the review to include the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for a credible nuclear deterrence posture, the relationship between deterrence policy and arms control objectives, and the necessary levels and composition of nuclear delivery systems. The curr_chunk discusses the United States military strategy, nuclear deterrence posture, targeting strategy, nuclear delivery systems, weapons complex, and nuclear weapons stockpile. Plans for modernization and modification are also mentioned. The United States military strategy and nuclear deterrence posture, including plans for modernization and modification of the weapons complex and stockpile. Assistant Secretary Crouch highlighted the need for changes in the multinational environment post-Cold War for a reduced dependence on offensive nuclear forces. The Administration aimed to improve relations with Russia post-Cold War and reduce reliance on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence. The NPR emphasized the need for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address emerging threats like WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles. This approach led to the development of a \"new triad\" of capabilities. The NPR's \"capabilities based approach\" aimed to provide a wide range of options for the President to tailor the national response to potential adversaries. The new triad of capabilities included nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, active and passive defenses, and a responsive weapons infrastructure. Command, control, intelligence, and planning were central to linking the components of the new triad. The NPR's new triad construct focuses on enhancing command and control capabilities to improve strike precision, defense forces, and adaptive planning for confronting emerging threats. This emphasis on NC2 capabilities could lead to new systems initiatives. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense are implementing the new triad construct from the 2001 NPR, focusing on enhancing command and control capabilities for better integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces. USSTRATCOM has taken on additional missions like global strike and missile defense. USSTRATCOM implemented the 2001 NPR framework, taking on additional missions like global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. In 2005, USSTRATCOM was designated as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction, establishing a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in September 2005. The 2001 NPR framework was incorporated into DOD doctrinal guidance, with a focus on deterring and responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Joint Staff was updating its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005, emphasizing crisis action planning and integration of nuclear capabilities. The 2005 update of the \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" emphasized deterring and responding to weapons of mass destruction, crisis action planning, and integration of nuclear capabilities. Reports suggested a focus on rapid crisis action planning to address unanticipated WMD threats. The 2005 update of the \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" emphasized rapid crisis action planning to respond to unanticipated WMD threats. This concept is a carry-over from the 2001 NPR and involves the time-sensitive development of joint operations plans and orders in response to an imminent crisis. The need for quick planning has been recognized in conventional combatant commands for years, while nuclear planning has typically been a long-term deliberate effort. To compress the time needed for nuclear forces to receive plans during a crisis, there may be a need for increased computer workstation capability, communication capacity, and integration with other military operations. Further growth in computer workstation capability and availability at nuclear command centers is necessary for rapid crisis action planning in response to WMD threats. This includes integrating plans with other military operations and increasing communications capacity for coordination with intelligence providers. Senior leaders are increasingly relying on bandwidth-hungry video-teleconferencing links for long-distance deliberations. Networked collaborative planning systems are becoming the norm in conventional military operations, and planners may desire to use them for nuclear planning as well. Senior leaders are increasingly expecting bandwidth-hungry video-teleconferencing links for long-distance deliberations and analysis regarding proposed courses of action. Robust communications are key for coordination with intelligence providers, who need to forward frequent updates and imagery on WMD targets. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to appoint a 12-member commission to review implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements to achieve NPR goals, including NC2 requirements. The commission must submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007, potentially advancing the debate on NPR implementation. The commission appointed by the Secretary of Defense is tasked with reviewing the implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements to achieve NPR goals, including NC2 requirements. The commission must submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007, potentially advancing the debate on NPR implementation and addressing the policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons. The presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, shaping the required command and control architecture. The current nuclear command and control systems were developed during the Cold War to manage a potential nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. The NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post were built during the Cold War to manage a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. The relevance of this infrastructure in the post-Cold War era is being questioned due to potential new requirements and challenges in nuclear command and control. The post-Cold War environment may require new programs for nuclear command and control infrastructure. A major concern during the Cold War was the threat of a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership to disrupt retaliation efforts and political control. Analysts emphasized the need for a robust nuclear command and control architecture. During the 1980s, concerns over decapitation attacks on nuclear command and control led to upgrades for increased redundancy and survivability. The threat of such attacks from Russia has diminished since the Cold War, with current U.S. policy viewing the relationship as non-adversarial. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, signed in 2002, reflects this shift in relations. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, signed in 2002 by Presidents Bush and Putin, aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons to levels between 1,700 and 2,200. This marked a significant decrease from the Cold War era. With the current non-adversarial relationship between the US and Russia, the need for a costly command and control architecture designed for a major nuclear exchange is being questioned. Despite the demise of the Soviet Union, analysts believe the US could still face various challenges in the future. Despite the reduced nuclear weapons levels post-Cold War, the question arises if the costly command and control architecture for a major nuclear exchange is still justified in the current strategic environment. Analysts warn of potential nuclear threats from China, with projections of significant military expenditures and advancements in survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM. General Zhu Chenghu's comments on using nuclear weapons against US cities in a Taiwan conflict further highlight the escalating tensions. The Chinese are acquiring more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM and have ICBM systems that can target most of the United States. General Zhu Chenghu's threat to use nuclear weapons against US cities in a Taiwan conflict has raised tensions. Analysts debate China's military ambitions in the Pacific Rim, with some suggesting the threat is overstated while others emphasize the need for a realistic approach to the relationship with China. Some analysts argue that the China threat is overstated, emphasizing the need for a realistic approach to the relationship with China. The idea of a \"China threat\" may be a search for a great power peer competitor, similar to past warnings about a \"coming war with Japan.\" This perceived threat could justify the development of major weapons systems, unlike the threat from non-state actors like al Qaeda. Some analysts argue that the China threat is overstated, emphasizing the need for a realistic approach to the relationship with China. The increasing Chinese nuclear capability, if accompanied by hostile relations or diplomatic crisis, could pose a renewed survivability threat to the nuclear command and control system. Other analysts point to rogue states like Iran or North Korea, emboldened by their pursuit of nuclear weapons, as reinforcing the need to maintain a viable NC2 architecture. North Korea has been actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability since the 1960s. North Korea, pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1960s, may have obtained information from A.Q. Khan. In 2005, they claimed to have nuclear weapons, with estimates suggesting they may have up to ten bombs. North Korea also produces various missiles, including SCUD and NoDong types. North Korea's nuclear weapons program is estimated to possibly have up to ten bombs. They also produce various missiles, but it is unclear if they can attach nuclear warheads to them. Reliable information on North Korea's capabilities is scarce, and some analysts believe their claims of possessing nuclear weapons may be a bluff. The Iranian nuclear program is a concern for threat analysts, with varying predictions on when they might acquire nuclear weapons. Some suggest Iran could have a bomb within two years, while others estimate they could have the capability by 2009. The lack of reliable information on North Korea's nuclear capabilities has led to skepticism among analysts, with some believing their claims of possessing nuclear weapons are a bluff. Iran is roughly ten years away from having atomic bomb capability, with varying predictions on when they might acquire nuclear weapons. Some suggest Iran could have a bomb within two years, while others estimate they could have the capability by 2009. The secrecy surrounding Iran's nuclear activities at Natanz and other sites has raised suspicions, with concerns about their development of long-range delivery systems. Iran's nuclear activities at Natanz and other sites have raised suspicions, with concerns about their development of long-range delivery systems and potential nuclear weapon capabilities. Iran's strident rhetoric towards Israel and the United States further exacerbates concerns about their intentions. Nations with small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion. The destruction of Israel and the United States raises concerns about hostile Iranian intentions. Nations with small nuclear arsenals could threaten U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion, causing widespread damage to critical systems. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the United States. Some analysts suggest that China could use a high altitude nuclear burst to generate EMP as a way to target US critical infrastructure. William Graham, the chair of the EMP Commission, highlighted Chinese military interest in this method of attack. Some analysts believe China could use EMP attacks on US infrastructure, as seen in Chinese military literature. North Korea and Iran may also be preparing for similar strategies with recent missile tests. Technology may allow for localized EMP bursts without nuclear detonation. Some missile tests, initially seen as failures, could be preparations for launching short-range missiles from a freighter off the U.S. coast. There is skepticism about the extent of the EMP threat, as many military and commercial systems have EMP protection. A single weapon attack from a freighter may not cause catastrophic failures as feared. Some analysts believe that key military systems have EMP protection and the threat from a single weapon attack from a freighter off the U.S. coast may not cause catastrophic failures. The motivation for China to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear, but using it against U.S. forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. There are doubts about North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program due to limited technology sharing. It would be challenging for rogue states or terrorist groups to develop a nuclear weapon. Some analysts doubt North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program due to limited technology sharing with Russia and China. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems to EMP attacks. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems to EMP attacks and deliver a report by June 30, 2007. The nuclear command and control system may need improvements to integrate nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces and defensive forces. The challenges for the nuclear command and control system include integrating nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as defensive forces. Improvements may be needed to expand decision-making processes and include additional participants. Implementing NPR recommendations could lead to a demand for increased capacity and faster response times, especially for missile defense. The process for directing non-nuclear strikes may also need refinement. The need for additional capacity and speed in missile defense response may require refining the process for directing non-nuclear strikes, including conventional attacks and non-kinetic options like information operations and special operations forces strikes. The question of \"release authority\" for these options may arise, as only the President can direct the release of nuclear weapons. The President's involvement in directing non-nuclear or non-kinetic options like information operations and special operations forces strikes is questioned. While the President has the authority to direct the release of nuclear weapons, historically, they have not been involved in planning specific conventional missions during existing hostilities. Historically, Presidents have not typically been involved in planning specific conventional missions during existing hostilities, such as in the Vietnam War. However, there may be instances where the strategic importance of targets could warrant Presidential involvement, especially in the opening rounds of hostilities. Requiring Presidential authorization for such strikes could pose technical and operational challenges. The commencement of hostilities may lead to strikes requiring Presidential authorization, posing technical challenges. Conventional weapons mixed with nuclear ones on the same platform need careful management to ensure only intended weapons are launched. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could have serious implications. The DOD's proposal includes conventional Trident missiles on nuclear armed submarines, requiring careful management to ensure only intended weapons are launched. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could have strategic effects, potentially equivalent to a WMD strike. Concerns have been raised about the level of Presidential involvement and control in such scenarios. Technical solutions for enforcing control have not been discussed. Some argue that non-kinetic responses like cyber-attacks could have strategic effects similar to a WMD strike. Concerns about Presidential involvement and control in these scenarios have been raised, but technical solutions for enforcing control have not been discussed. Adding more participants to the command and control process from different communities may require revising approval processes to prevent delays in decision-making and implementation. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation in approval processes to prevent delays in decision-making and implementation. Critical targets could be missed if decisions take too long to reach or grant execution authorities. In some scenarios, a decision may be needed on what locations to defend, potentially requiring Presidential involvement due to limited defensive capabilities and fleeting response opportunities. In scenarios where limited defensive capabilities and fleeting response opportunities exist, analysts recommend delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander, possibly with standing Presidential guidance. Choosing between defensive launches and offensive strikes may require Presidential consideration to choreograph decision-making within limited time frames. In scenarios with limited defensive capabilities, analysts suggest delegating missile defense release authority to the combatant commander with standing Presidential guidance. Choosing between defensive launches and offensive strikes may require Presidential consideration to choreograph decision-making within limited time frames. Successful defensive responses could impact offensive options, while overwhelming attacks may necessitate earlier offensive responses for damage control. Consideration of defensive responses post-detection of a potential attack will involve additional participants in the decision-making process. The decision-making process for missile defense involves multiple command centers, including regional combatant commanders like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM. USSTRATCOM leads missile defense efforts but must coordinate with other commands for interoperability. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure command and control systems are compatible. The missile defense command and control systems must be interoperable with regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure compatibility with common technical standards. Bandwidth demands will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences for missile defense. The ultimate customer for the command and control system is the President, who must be presented with non-nuclear and defensive choices for decision-making. The command and control system for missile defense must present non-nuclear and defensive choices to the President for decision-making. It should facilitate the President's interaction with advisors, aid in decision-making within tight timelines, and maintain tight control over nuclear weapons. The system must ensure clear and actionable orders reach weapons operators. The nuclear command and control system must support the President in making decisions quickly and clearly regarding nuclear operations. It should also maintain tight control over nuclear weapons and ensure that orders to weapons operators are actionable. Additionally, these systems can have value beyond nuclear operations by supporting non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring. The nuclear command and control system supports the President in making quick decisions regarding nuclear operations. It also aids in monitoring non-nuclear military forces direction and status, including supporting crisis response and recovery efforts. A response cell or crisis action team (CAT) can be formed from various agencies to prepare orders, monitor forces, and deliver briefings for a developing situation. Command and control assets, like NORAD and NMCC, supported mitigation and recovery efforts after the 9/11 attacks, aiding in restoring normal air traffic. These assets are crucial for continuity of operations (COOP) and continuity of government (COG) during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush utilized USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska on September 11, 2001 for COG purposes. After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush utilized command and control assets at USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska for continuity of government purposes. These assets can also support civil authorities in consequence mitigation after disasters or domestic events, as seen during Hurricane Rita in 2005. Command and control assets were used by U.S. Northern Command to monitor the government response to Hurricane Rita in 2005. These assets can support civil authorities for consequence mitigation after disasters. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), a modified Boeing 747-200 aircraft, is available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. Despite not being used during Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, it was utilized during Hurricane Opal in 1995. These systems are valued for their versatile monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing capabilities by senior government leadership. During Hurricane Opal in 1995, the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) was utilized, showcasing its versatile monitoring and communication capabilities. Senior government leadership, including Secretary Rumsfeld, values these systems for day-to-day support and official travel. However, using these assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires careful consideration to avoid competition and potential shortfalls in crisis response plans. Integrating these systems with other agencies, like FEMA, adds complexity to their utilization. Balancing tradeoffs for high-value, low-number assets beyond nuclear forces could lead to competition for access during crises, potentially causing response plan shortfalls. Tying systems to other agencies like FEMA adds complexity and costs, forcing the military to sustain outdated systems. Using platforms for secondary roles burdens military operators and reduces readiness for primary missions, especially with shrinking manpower pools. The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to review the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, considering new technology and potential threats. This review was chaired by former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft and aimed to examine the architecture from national command authority to individual weapons. The \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System\" chaired by Brent Scowcroft focused on survivability issues of NC2 systems designed during the Cold War, highlighting the degradation of system hardness due to lack of maintenance and procedural discipline since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The End-to-End Review highlighted the degradation of system hardness in NC2 systems due to lack of maintenance and procedural discipline since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It recommended shifting NC2 systems life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community to address operator requirements for new capabilities not being supported in the new systems or modifications purchased. The End-to-End Review recommended shifting NC2 systems life cycle management to operators to address operator requirements for new capabilities not supported by acquisitions. Operator-generated requirements may be unrealistic or exceed program budgets, leading to a focus on technical capability over total costs of sustainment and operation. The debate continues on meeting operator needs while managing acquisition programs economically. Another concern is the decline in NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War, leading to a decrease in skilled personnel and a revolving door of specialists in nuclear operations. The decline in nuclear forces has led to a decrease in skilled personnel with expertise in nuclear operations, resulting in a \"brain drain\" and a revolving door of specialists. This lack of depth in key NC2 positions could hinder responses during crises. Additionally, the legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's push towards military transformation. US Strategic Command is transitioning towards more network-oriented, distributed operations. The legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's push towards military transformation. US Strategic Command is moving towards more network-oriented, distributed operations with subordinate functional component commands dedicated to specific mission aspects. These multi-service organizations are geographically separated, promoting decentralization of activity away from headquarters towards a more collaborative process. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes changes in NC2 programs to facilitate USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. It recommends retiring expensive legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and suggests procuring C-32 aircraft as replacements. The NAOC capability for supporting FEMA would shift to E-6B aircraft with additional communication upgrades. The USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007. The QDR recommends retiring expensive legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and suggests procuring C-32 aircraft as replacements. The NAOC capability for supporting FEMA would shift to E-6B aircraft with additional communication upgrades. USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007 to fulfill survivability requirements through a new distributed architecture. The new command and control capabilities must be survivable in the event of WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks. Robust communications infrastructure is needed to integrate the activities of these new organizations. USSTRATCOM is studying implementation of an IP-based communications architecture. The Department of Defense (DOD) proposes tailored systems for WMD elimination and robust communications infrastructure for new organizations. USSTRATCOM is exploring an IP-based communications architecture, but its effectiveness for nuclear command and control is uncertain. Communication bandwidth is already limited in the military due to a 500% growth in the past decade. The nuclear community faces challenges in ensuring priority for high-priority nuclear force direction messages due to limited communication bandwidth. The demand for satellite communication links has increased significantly, with a projected 2500% growth in the next 10 years. Coordinating the integration of new systems into the NC2 network, such as missile defense or conventional strike, will be necessary. The level of certification required for these new systems is still undetermined. The nuclear community faces challenges in coordinating the integration of new systems into the NC2 network, such as missile defense or conventional strike. The level of certification required for these new systems is still undetermined, raising questions about compatibility and configuration management. Reconciliation of procedures and protocols in a distributed architecture will be key to avoiding chaos as more agencies gain access to equivalent data. The chain of command and identification of the level empowered to direct action or forces must be clearly defined and enforced. (94)  Procurement programs tied to the nuclear command and control system will be affected. The procurement programs tied to the nuclear command and control system in DOD's budget requests focus on upgrades and enhancements of existing systems, rather than new systems. The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) is being upgraded with funds allocated for procurement and research and development in FY2006. Congress fully authorized these amounts in the FY2006 Defense budget. The MEECN, part of the nuclear command and control system, is being upgraded with funds for procurement and research in FY2006 and FY2007. Modernization efforts include high data rate terminals for command and control aircraft and upgrades to secure computer terminals. Modernization efforts within MEECN include upgrades to high data rate terminals for command and control aircraft, secure computer terminals for nuclear command centers, improvements to satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers, installation of communications systems for bomber and tanker forces, and enhancements to the National Military Command System. The modernization efforts within MEECN include upgrades to high data rate terminals for command and control aircraft, secure computer terminals for nuclear command centers, improvements to satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers, and installation of communications systems for bomber and tanker forces. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is personally involved in directing upgrades to the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R, aiming to consolidate separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon focused on tracking global crises. The Defense Department is consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon to track global crises and provide military advice to the President. These new facilities will be more secure against threats and intelligence gathering, and will create efficiencies leading to a reduction in manpower. The consolidation effort is timed to coincide with ongoing Pentagon renovation work. The Defense Department is consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon to track global crises and provide military advice to the President. This effort, timed with ongoing Pentagon renovation work, aims to create efficiencies and reduce manpower. Funding requests for planning and system engineering are in place for FY2006 and beyond. Additionally, funds are being sought for the development of a future missile warning and attack assessment system. The Defense Department is requesting funds for missile warning and attack assessment systems, including upgrades at NORAD and USSTRATCOM. Congress funded the full DOD request for FY2006 and provided partial funding in appropriations legislation. For FY2007, DOD is asking for further research and development funds. Additionally, funds are being requested to enhance airborne nuclear command and control platforms. The Defense Department is requesting $50.9 million for further research and development in airborne command and control. Funds are also requested to enhance the E-4B NAOC and E-6B ABNCP platforms. The Air Force requested $85.3 million for NAOC modifications in FY2006, which was fully authorized by Congress. The FY2007 budget request includes $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D. These funds cover improvements to aircraft structures, propulsion, fuel systems, environmental controls, electrical generation, and flight safety. The DOD's FY2007 budget request includes $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D. The requested funds cover improvements to aircraft structures, propulsion, fuel systems, environmental controls, electrical generation, and flight safety. Specific upgrades include digital audio equipment, an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders, LAN improvements, UHF radio link transition, precision navigation upgrades, and integration with Global Air Traffic systems. Additionally, upgrades are proposed for the E-6B fleet operated by the Navy. The proposed upgrades for the E-6B fleet, operated by the Navy for USSTRATCOM, include improvements to aircraft systems such as cockpit displays, navigation systems, and air traffic control integration. Mission system upgrades would involve replacing legacy computers, communication switches, and UHF communications equipment. The modifications, requested for FY2006, would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The Navy also plans a service life assessment of the airframe due to exceeding its service life based on weight and usage. The Navy's proposed upgrades for the E-6B fleet include improvements to aircraft systems like cockpit displays, navigation systems, and air traffic control integration. Mission system upgrades would involve replacing legacy computers, communication switches, and UHF communications equipment. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for E-6 modifications in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, with funding exceeding the DOD budget figure. For FY2007, the Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development. The Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development in FY2007. The Advanced EHF communications satellite is a key aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs, providing secure, anti-jam communications capabilities at higher data rates than the existing MILSTAR constellation. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are involved in the satellite integration. The AEHF system, used for nuclear command and control, currently has five satellites launched since 1994. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the program. The Air Force requested funding in the FY2006 budget, which was fully funded by Congress. In FY2007, the DOD did not request procurement funds, but the Air Force is seeking funds for R&D. The Air Force budget request for AEHF was fully funded in FY2006 and matched by Congress. In FY2007, DOD did not request procurement funds, but the Air Force is seeking $633 million for AEHF R&D. The program has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, with technical shortfalls causing delays in the delivery of communications encryption equipment. The first AEHF launch is now targeted for 2008, with the program estimated to cost over $7 billion. The AEHF program, facing schedule delays and cost overruns, is now estimated to cost over $7 billion. The first launch is targeted for 2008, with plans to bridge MILSTAR and TSAT programs. TSAT's launch in 2013 has been delayed due to budget cuts and immature technologies, prompting proposals to test advanced capabilities on AEHF satellites first. The laser communication cross-links between satellites and Internet routing capability program, initially planned for launch in 2013, has been delayed by two years due to budget cuts and immature technologies. Some suggest testing these technologies on AEHF satellites first to reduce risk on the TSAT program. Congress considered acquiring additional AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites in case of further TSAT delays, reducing funding for TSAT by $400 million in the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act. In the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress reduced funding for TSAT by $400 million and directed the Air Force to focus on technology development. Congress approved $436-plus million, reserving $120 million for either purchasing a fourth AEHF satellite or continued systems development for TSAT. The nuclear command and control system faces challenges due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent DOD policy, competing for budget priority against conventional systems in today's threat environment and the war on terror. The nuclear command and control system faces challenges due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent DOD policy. The system's legacy Cold War architecture competes for budget priority against conventional systems in today's threat environment and the war on terror. Key functions of the NCCS will likely remain requirements as long as the United States maintains a nuclear deterrent, with ongoing modernization initiatives in a budget-constrained environment. The NCCS's value lies in fulfilling missions beyond traditional DOD purview, with key functions necessary for US nuclear deterrent. DOD pursues modernization amidst budget constraints, facing competing pressures. USSTRATCOM's actions and 2006 QDR recommendations may signal a shift. Congress faces questions on the nature of the threat, with differing views on China's role in global military dynamics. The activation of functional component commands by USSTRATCOM and recommendations in the 2006 QDR may indicate a change in direction. Congress may need to address the nature of threats from China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, including nuclear and EMP attacks. Debates exist on the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy and how it impacts command and control. There is a competition between reducing the role of nuclear weapons for non-proliferation efforts and increasing their utility. The role of nuclear weapons in US strategy impacts command and control. There is a debate between reducing their role for non-proliferation efforts and increasing their utility. The architecture of the NCCS may need revisions to incorporate additional command and control requirements. Release authorities may require a debate and possibly legislation. During the Cold War, the debate over the right approach to nuclear command and control continues. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may be necessary to incorporate new command and control requirements. A more dispersed approach, proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be more suitable for the current threat environment. The level of investment in modernization or new procurement is still being debated, with initiatives projected to continue for years. The debate over nuclear command and control continues, with questions about the level of investment needed for modernization. The NCCS modernization initiatives are ongoing, with potential short-term savings from retiring certain platforms. The competition for resources between NCCS and other services' needs is a concern. The value of existing NCCS platforms and their secondary uses are being evaluated. The NCCS is being evaluated for recapitalization after duty in Iraq, with questions on its adequacy, necessity, and secondary uses. The national asset built over decades may provide added value for homeland security and disaster response missions. Considerations include transferring procurement and operation to civilian agencies if primary mission requirements are surpassed."
