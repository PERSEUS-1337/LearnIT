The success of feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks lies in their ability to learn and develop internal structures based on the provided data during training. However, most ANNs lack generalization and their performance degrades on unseen data, indicating a reliance on memorization rather than understanding inherent rules. The learning process in neural networks is primarily based on memorization, lacking quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction. In contrast, other living species, such as children, demonstrate the ability to extrapolate and reason numerically, indicating a key difference in generalization capabilities. The learning process in neural networks is based on memorization, lacking quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction. Children can memorize single digit arithmetic operations and extrapolate to higher digits, indicating the key to generalization is in understanding how to reuse memorized examples. Complex operations are combinations of simple functions, so developing complex numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning in ANNs involves identifying and learning fundamental operations that can be reused. In this work, fundamental operations for arithmetic operations are identified and learned using neural networks. These operations are then reused to develop larger networks for solving complex problems like n-digit multiplication and division. This approach is a generalized solution for arithmetic operations, different from existing methods. This work proposes a complex neural network solution for arithmetic operations, including n-digit multiplication and division. Unlike previous methods, it works for both positive and negative numbers. Neural networks are known for approximating mathematical functions, but generalizing over unseen data makes the network architecture complex. Recent works have attempted to train neural networks to generalize over minimal training data for arithmetic operations. While previous models like EqnMaster could only handle arithmetic functions over 3-digit numbers, the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) shows promise in this regard. The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) uses linear activations to represent numerical quantities and predict the output of arithmetic functions. It addresses extrapolation issues in end-to-end learning tasks, unlike previous models like EqnMaster. Extrapolation issues in end-to-end learning tasks can be addressed by using optimal depth networks with binary logic gates for simple arithmetic functions. Neural networks inspired by digital circuits can efficiently solve arithmetic problems. Our work builds on previous research on digital circuits and neural networks for solving arithmetic problems. We propose a network that can predict the output of basic arithmetic functions for both positive and negative decimal integers, unlike existing models that only work on limited digits. Instead of using a single neural network for different tasks, we suggest training several smaller networks for different subtasks to achieve better results. Our proposed approach involves training multiple smaller networks for different subtasks in arithmetic operations, such as signed multiplication and division. By combining these networks, we can perform complex tasks efficiently. Additionally, we utilize a loop unrolling strategy to generalize solutions from single-digit to multi-digit arithmetic operations. Multiplication is likened to repeated addition, while division is likened to repeated subtraction. These operations are implemented on digital circuits using shift and accumulator methods.

The text discusses the design of neural networks for arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. By using weighted inputs and activation functions, complex functions such as arithmetic equation calculators can be achieved. The addition module uses a single neuron with weights {+1, +1}, while the subtraction module uses weights {+1, -1}. These modules simplify the task of creating neural network operations for addition and subtraction. The addition and subtraction modules in the neural network are implemented using single neurons with specific weights. The modules simplify the process of performing arithmetic operations like shift-and-add multiplication. The place value shifter ensures the output is correctly positioned for addition to obtain the final result. The network can handle multiple inputs and uses fixed weights for calculations. The place value shifter is used to position the output correctly for addition in the neural network module for single digit multiplication. It consists of a single neuron with linear activation and can handle n inputs, each with a 1-digit number. The network has two input neurons, 1 hidden layer with 30 neurons, and an output layer of 82 neurons to learn the outcomes of 1-digit integer multiplication. The highest-ranked prediction is selected as the final output. The proposed feed forward network for single digit multiplication has two input neurons, a hidden layer with 30 neurons, and an output layer of 82 neurons. The model computes the absolute value of a single number using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The process involves x + x, x \u2212 x operations in the first hidden layer, a maxpool layer in the second layer, and subtraction in the final output layer. Input and output sign calculators are also used in the network. The input sign calculator extracts the sign of an input number x using x/(1 + mod(x)) activation function. The output sign calculator computes the sign of the result from a multiplication or division of two numbers using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The network takes sign and magnitude as input, passing it to a hidden layer of 10 neurons before reaching the output layer. The neural network model includes layers for addition, modulus activation, and subtraction. It uses sign and magnitude inputs to predict the output of sign multiplication. The process involves converting numbers to positive integers, performing multiplication with fundamental operations, and extracting input and output signs. The process of signed multiplication involves converting two n-digit signed integers into positive integers using absolute operation. The multiplication is then performed using single digit multiplication operations and carry forwards to obtain the final result. The signed multiplication process involves converting n-digit signed integers into positive integers using absolute operation. Single digit multiplication is used to multiply each token of the multiplicand with the 1st token of the multiplier, with carry forwards. The final output is assigned a sign using 1-digit sign multiply. The division model separates sign and magnitude during pre-processing, inspired by long architecture.
