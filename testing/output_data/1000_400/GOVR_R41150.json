The House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not providing leadership in water supply management. The challenges of balancing needs and increasing demand require active leadership. The Central Valley Project in California faces water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations. The Central Valley Project in California has limited water deliveries and pumping due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations, which found that continued operation of the projects would jeopardize the existence of certain fish species protected under the Endangered Species Act. The BiOps found that the operation of the Central Valley Project under the OCAP plan could harm Delta Smelt and salmon, protected under the Endangered Species Act. Factors like increased pumping, invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals have contributed to fish declines. Low water deliveries to certain districts have also been a concern. Factors such as invasive species, pollution, and non-federal water withdrawals from the Delta have led to fishery declines, particularly affecting Delta Smelt. This has resulted in court-imposed limits on pumping and a review of project operations. Low water deliveries to specific districts are worsening unemployment in an already struggling economy. Proposed FY2010 amendments to prevent BiOps implementation in the CVP were not passed, but a bill included a two-year authorization for water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions.

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil in case of supply interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), authorized in 1975, consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas filled to capacity with 727 million barrels of crude oil. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, instead adding to it with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquired by the Department of Energy. The federal government has not purchased oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) since 1994. Starting in 2000, additions to the SPR were made with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquired by the Department of Energy. Congress passed legislation in May 2008 ordering DOE to suspend RIK fill unless the price of crude oil dropped below $75/barrel. In 2008, Congress ordered the DOE to suspend RIK fill for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. However, due to a decline in oil prices, fill of the SPR resumed. The Bush Administration announced plans in 2009 to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the SPR. RIK fill was resumed in May 2009 at an average of 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered by January 2010. This brought the SPR to capacity, and a transitional phasing out of the RIK Program was announced in September 2009. In May 2009, RIK fill was resumed at an average volume of 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered by January 2010, bringing the SPR to capacity. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced a transitional phasing out of the RIK Program in September 2009. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required expansion of the SPR to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels, with a possible site in Richton, MS for an additional 160 million barrels of capacity. However, the Administration proposed to suspend spending for expansion in its FY2011 request. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels, with a potential site in Richton, MS for an extra 160 million barrels. The Administration proposed redirecting funds from SPR expansion to non-expansion operations in FY2011, citing EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. This led to a reduced FY2011 request for the SPR to $138.9 million, down from $243.8 million in FY2010. The budget justification cited EIA projections that U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence will decline, leading to a reduced FY2011 request for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to $138.9 million. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $209.9 million for the SPR. P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at $209.9 million but rescinded $86.8 million from prior year appropriations. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a major federal funder of research in the physical sciences.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) was authorized to support energy technology research projects, receiving funding in FY2009. ARPA-E's mission is to overcome long-term technological barriers in energy development. The FY2011 request for ARPA-E was $300 million, with an appropriation of $179.6 million in P.L. 112-10. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste. The Obama Administration decided to terminate the development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which was established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. This decision came as part of the FY2011 budget, which also included funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to overcome technological barriers in energy development. The requested budget for ARPA-E was $300 million, but only $179.6 million was appropriated in P.L. 112-10. The Obama Administration terminated the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository development as part of the FY2011 budget. DOE filed a license application for Yucca Mountain in 2008 but withdrew it in 2010. NRC rejected the withdrawal motion, and the full commission is now considering it. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, but NRC rejected it, citing NWPA requirements. The full NRC commission is now reviewing the withdrawal, opposed by states with defense-related waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by DOE in 2010, is evaluating alternatives to Yucca Mountain and studying options for nuclear waste disposal. Congress allocated $5 million for the Commission to study options for nuclear waste storage, treatment, and disposal. A draft report is due in 18 months, with a final report in two years. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead waste management activities, with funding for research on disposal technologies. Utilities are unhappy with DOE's failure to meet waste acceptance deadlines. Substantial funding has been requested for NE to conduct research on nuclear waste disposal technologies and options. Nuclear utilities have won court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet waste acceptance deadlines and compensate for damages. DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal from reactor sites begins by 2020. DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal from reactor sites begins by 2020. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program to support energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Estimated future government costs from the loan guarantees must be paid upfront by each project. Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized loan guarantees for energy projects with new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Project owners must pay upfront for estimated future government costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized loan guarantees for energy projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. DOE was provided with $47 billion in loan guarantee authority for various energy sectors, including nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested an increase in the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced in 2010 for the Vogtle nuclear power plant expansion in Georgia. The nuclear industry pushed for a higher loan guarantee ceiling to secure financing for new nuclear power plants. The Department of Energy announced a $8.33 billion loan guarantee for adding two reactors to the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. Critics argue that tripling nuclear loan guarantees would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The proposed increase to $54.5 billion in nuclear loan guarantees could cover about 13 reactors, criticized as a taxpayer bailout diverting resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects, with $6 billion initially allocated but some funds redirected to other programs. The Sec. 1705 loan guarantee program under ARRA had a $6 billion appropriation, but $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion was rescinded. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees under the Sec. 1703 program. President Obama requested a $500 million appropriation for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees under the Sec. 1703 program.

The FY2010 appropriation for various programs including Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction totaled $446.4 million. The FY2011 request for these programs was $539.7 million. Institutional Site Support funding decreased from $120.1 million in FY2010 to $41.0 million in the FY2011 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds by $71.0 million to address gaps at facilities like Pantex and Y-12. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds by $71.0 million to address gaps at facilities like Pantex and Y-12, including restoring funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressing concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a costly and controversial project, with a budget of $97.0 million in FY2010 and a request of $225.0 million in FY2011. It aims to replace the over 50-year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building, which houses research on plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have expressed concerns about the project's mission and its impact on nuclear complex transformation plans. The CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory lacks a clear mission unless there is a decision to pursue new nuclear warhead design and production. The Senate Appropriations Committee highlighted safety concerns with the existing CMR facility, while budget cuts may lead to delays in transitioning to the new facility. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for critical decisions on the stockpile to determine the requirements for nuclear weapons facilities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have differing recommendations for funding the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The House committee recommended no funds due to uncertainty about the stockpile's nature and size, while the Senate committee proposed $125.0 million to address previous funding shortfalls and operational restrictions at the CMR facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory to address previous funding shortfalls and operational restrictions. Some argue that Plutonium Facility 4 could fulfill some of CMRR's functions, and that CMRR's capacity exceeds needs. The Senate committee also supports smaller programs like Secure Transportation Asset for nuclear weapons transport. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for various Weapons Activities programs, including Secure Transportation Asset, Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response, and Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program. The FY2011 requests for these programs were approved by the committee. The FY2011 budget for nuclear security programs, including Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program and Site Stewardship, was recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for Site Stewardship program in FY2010 and FY2011. The FY2010 request was $90.4 million, but the appropriation was $61.3 million. The House and Senate bills allocated $62.4 million and $61.3 million respectively. The FY2011 request was $105.5 million, with a recommended reduction of $5.0 million by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Safeguards and Security includes Defense Nuclear Security for protective forces and security systems. The FY2010 appropriation for the Site Stewardship program was $61.3 million, lower than the requested $90.4 million. In FY2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the $105.5 million request by $5.0 million. Safeguards and Security's Defense Nuclear Security element saw a reduction in funding due to efficiencies in staffing and procurement decisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for operations and maintenance, but reduced the construction budget by $9.0 million to $43.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for Defense Nuclear Security operations and maintenance, with a $9.0 million reduction in construction budget to $43.0 million. Cyber Security aims to ensure information security across NNSA enterprise. The FY2011 request for Cyber Security was $124.3 million, recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The NNSA implements technology and information management security safeguards to protect its assets. The FY2010 appropriation was $122.5 million, increasing to $124.3 million in FY2011 as recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Nonproliferation and national security programs under the NNSA support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons globally. Funding for these programs in FY2010 was $2.137 billion, up from $1.482 billion in FY2009, mainly due to the inclusion of major construction projects. Funding for nonproliferation and national security programs increased to $2.137 billion in FY2010 from $1.482 billion in FY2009, with a focus on major construction projects like the Mixed-Oxide plant and Waste Solidification Building. The Obama Administration requested further increases for FY2011, including the Pit Disassembly plant. Nonproliferation and Verification R&D received $317.3 million in FY2010, with a request for $351.6 million in FY2011. International security programs, including safeguards and export controls, saw a decrease in funding from $187.2 million in FY2010 to $155.9 million in the FY2011 request. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) aims to reduce nuclear threats. The FY2011 budget for nonproliferation and international security programs was $351.6 million. Funding for International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) was $572.1 million in FY2010 and increased to $590.1 million in the FY2011 request. Efforts to eliminate weapons-grade plutonium production in Russia involved shutting down reactors and replacing them with fossil-fueled facilities. Russia is shutting down three nuclear reactors that produce weapons-grade plutonium and supply power to communities. Two reactors were closed in 2008 and replaced with fossil-fueled facilities. The third reactor will be shut down in December 2010 and replaced with another fossil-fueled facility. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for the program was $24.5 million for FY2010, with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to convert surplus weapons-grade plutonium into fuel for commercial power reactors. The Obama Administration secured funding for the program, with $701.9 million allocated for FY2010 and $1,030.7 million requested for FY2011 to continue construction of the Savannah River project and research efforts. The FY2011 budget requested $1,030.7 million for a program to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium, including funding for research and development of a gas-turbine modular helium reactor. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aimed to convert research reactors to use less enriched uranium and protect nuclear materials from theft or sabotage, with a FY2011 request of $558.8 million. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities and federal civilian nuclear energy research laboratories. The cleanup includes disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, management of surplus nuclear materials, remediation of contamination, and decontamination of buildings. The FY2011 budget requested $558.8 million for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to prevent theft or sabotage of nuclear materials worldwide. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of federal nuclear facilities, including decontamination and decommissioning. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at larger, more complex facilities with high-level radioactive waste storage. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still require cleanup, with estimated costs ranging from $192.8 billion to $247.2 billion. The Office of Environmental Management administers 18 facilities with incomplete cleanup, estimating costs between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for ongoing operation, maintenance, and monitoring of contamination levels at these sites. Long-term activities for radioactive waste containment may be necessary indefinitely due to decay periods. The Office of Environmental Management oversees facilities with incomplete cleanup, estimating costs between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Long-term activities for radioactive waste containment may be necessary indefinitely due to decay periods. Some facilities have been transferred to other offices within DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the transfer of cleanup responsibility for smaller, less contaminated facilities to the Corps under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Cleanup of FUSRAP sites is funded within the civil works budget of the Corps. The cleanup of Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) sites is funded within the civil works budget of the Corps. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps is responsible for activities for the first two years, then jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. The Department's Office of Legacy Management handles long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for these offices is discussed in three appropriations accounts. The Office of Environmental Management handles cleanup and monitoring activities at FUSRAP sites and facilities. Funding for the office comes from three appropriations accounts, with a total of $5.69 billion allocated in FY2011, a decrease from the previous year. In FY2011, the DOE's Office of Environmental Management received $5.69 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The enacted amount was $358 million below the President's request and $319 million below the FY2010 appropriation. Additionally, P.L. 112-10 rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for the three accounts funding the office. In FY2011, the DOE's Office of Environmental Management received $5.69 billion, a decrease from the previous year. P.L. 112-10 rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for three accounts funding the office, including funds for cleanup at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. Facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory have complex cleanup challenges from nuclear weapons production, requiring significant funding. These three facilities receive over half of the total funding for the DOE's Office of Environmental Management. Cleanup at these sites is expected to continue for decades, with completion estimated as late as 2062 for Hanford, 2040 for Savannah River Site, and 2044 for Idaho National Laboratory due to the extensive treatment and disposal of high-level radioactive wastes. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that cleanup at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory may not be complete until 2062, 2040, and 2044 respectively due to the extensive volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites. There are technical difficulties in treating and disposing of these wastes, with delays in constructing waste treatment facilities posing additional challenges. The Idaho National Laboratory stores high-level radioactive wastes intended for permanent disposal in a geologic repository. Challenges include waste removal, treatment, and delays in facility construction. Concerns arise from potential untreated waste release into the environment, with some tanks at Hanford leaking into groundwater. The Department of Energy monitors water quality in the Columbia River for contamination. Funding sources for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities are also being scrutinized. The DOE monitors water quality in the Columbia River for contaminants to ensure they are within acceptable levels. There is increasing interest in funding sources for the cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN, established under Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was created to finance the cleanup, with special assessments collected from nuclear utilities. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, is funded by special assessments from nuclear utilities and federal government payments. Both parties are required to contribute to the fund for the cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established in 1992 to fund the cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. The federal government and nuclear utilities were required to contribute to the fund. The authority to collect utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued federal payments through annual appropriations. Reauthorizing the utility assessments and federal payment has been an ongoing issue due to insufficient funds for cleanup costs. Congress has maintained federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund without separate reauthorizing legislation. The fund balance is insufficient for future cleanup costs, with $4.5 billion available but DOE estimates $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needed. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in FY2011 to increase cleanup resources. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in FY2011 to increase cleanup resources. The estimated amount for assessments in FY2011 is $200 million, with a total of $2.2 billion over a 10-year period from FY2011 through FY2020. Legislation is required for the federal government to resume collection of the assessments, with bills introduced in the 111th Congress but not enacted. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstating assessments considering the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstating assessments due to the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President requested $730.5 million for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, a $223.5 million decrease from the President's request. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, a $223.5 million decrease from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted the lack of legislation to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments for generating $200 million in offsetting receipts. The existing balance in the fund exceeded the request by several billion dollars. Additionally, $33.6 million was allocated for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, significantly lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The committee highlighted that the existing balance in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund exceeded the request by billions of dollars. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the federal payment in FY2011, much lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a smaller federal payment to fulfill the required contribution as authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a smaller federal payment to fulfill the remaining balance of the required federal contribution to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund as authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, additional federal funds may still be necessary in the future under existing law to ensure the cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities is completed. Once a facility is cleaned up, responsibility for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The DOE's Office of Legacy Management takes over long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities after cleanup of facilities under DOE's Environmental Management or FUSRAP program. The office also manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. Funding for the Office of Legacy Management is expected to increase over time. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011, the same as the President requested but slightly less than the $189.8 million appropriation enacted for FY2010. Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to rise over time as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Priority for PMA power is given to \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at the lowest possible rates. The PMAs are responsible for covering their expenses. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) prioritize selling power to municipal utilities and cooperatives at low rates. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a decrease of $4 million from FY2010. This change reclassified receipts from PMAs from mandatory to discretionary funding, requiring additional discretionary funding for some PMAs. The FY2011 budget request continued the change enacted in FY2010 that reclassified receipts from the PMAs from mandatory to discretionary. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. P.L. 112-10 appropriated the requested amount for the PMAs. BPA is a self-funded agency and receives no appropriations. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. BPA is a self-funded agency under authority granted by P.L. 93-454 and receives no appropriations. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act, along with borrowing authority for new electric power transmission lines. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) with borrowing authority for new electric power transmission lines to deliver renewable energy resources. WAPA can now borrow up to $3.25 billion from the United States Treasury on a permanent basis. Additionally, independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, including funds for safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. The budget for new reactor activities saw an increase to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. The NRC budget request for FY2011 included $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle license applications for new nuclear power plants. Electric utilities and generating companies applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007, with more possible through 2011. The proposed budget also included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. The Obama Administration aimed to cancel the project, leading to a motion to withdraw the license application. The requested amount was included in P.L. 112-10 for regulation of operating reactors. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included funding for Yucca Mountain licensing support activities, reactor safety inspections, license renewals, modifications, and homeland security spending. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees. The NRC's budget is set to increase by $3.8 million in FY2011, reaching $26.1 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates that 90% of NRC's budget be covered by fees from licensees. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund, general homeland security, and DOE defense waste oversight are not included in this offset. The FY2011 request includes offsets resulting in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a decrease of $16.4 million from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including funding for the inspector general's office."
