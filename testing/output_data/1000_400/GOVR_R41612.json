    "content": "The United States has historically been a major provider of food aid globally, but funding for agricultural development has decreased over the years. Critics argue that this has reduced the country's capacity to provide assistance. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a priority during his administration, especially in response to the global food price crisis of 2007-2008. In 2009, his administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative. In 2009, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative called Feed the Future. The initiative aims to promote global agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. Some argue that reform of American food aid and foreign assistance is necessary and overdue. Some believe it is a critical moment in U.S. foreign assistance history, especially in agriculture development and food security. Reform of American food aid and foreign assistance is deemed necessary and long overdue. A new U.S. global food security initiative should adopt innovative approaches with increased local buy-in and private sector engagement for sustainable humanitarian objectives. Interagency reviews of development and foreign assistance policies are underway, relevant for Congress discussions. The curr_chunk discusses the role of Congress in funding and overseeing agricultural development programs for global food security. Various U.S. agencies and international organizations are involved in these efforts, with Congress exerting influence through the appropriations process. The 112th Congress may also consider legislation related to these initiatives. The U.S. global food security initiative is funded and overseen by various U.S. agencies and international organizations, with Congress exerting influence through the appropriations process. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the initiative. The 112th Congress may consider legislation related to agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Uncertainty exists regarding potential increases in U.S. foreign assistance funding due to House leadership changes and the federal budget deficit. The primary objectives of the report are to provide context on global food insecurity, discuss the Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, and highlight issues for Congress to consider regarding agricultural development and global food security. The global food insecurity crisis in 2009 led to over 1 billion people being undernourished, with the number decreasing to 925 million in 2010. The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative aimed to address these issues, while the 112th Congress may consider legislation on agricultural development and food security. The number of hungry people in the world increased in 2008 and 2009 due to global food and economic crises. In 2010, an estimated 925 million people will suffer chronic hunger, a decrease from 1.023 billion in 2009. The FAO data shows a slow but steady increase in undernourished people over the past decade, with gains in hunger reduction reversed in some regions due to decreased investment in agriculture. The number of hungry people increased globally due to food and economic crises. FAO reports a reversal in hunger reduction gains in various regions, including Latin America and the Caribbean. The proportion of undernourished people dropped from 20% in the early 1990s to 16% in the mid-2000s but rose by a percentage point in 2008. The U.N. Secretary General highlights the impact of recent crises on reversing progress in reducing hunger. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from about 20% in the early 1990s to about 16% in the mid-2000s but rose by a percentage point in 2008. The U.N. Secretary General suggests that progress in meeting the MDGs of reducing hunger has slowed or even reversed. FAO's 2010 hunger report estimated that 578 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries. The 2010 hunger report by FAO estimated that 578 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries. The global hunger figure in 2010 marked a decline of 9.6% from 2009, with significant reductions in Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa saw a smaller drop, with about 12 million fewer people going hungry. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index also showed improvement from 1990 to 2010. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of food insecurity, with one in three people undernourished. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index shows improvements in various regions, with significant progress in Southeast Asia and Latin America. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The Global Health Index (GHI) scores have decreased significantly in various regions, with a 25% reduction in South Asia and a 33% decrease in the Near East and North Africa. Southeast Asia and Latin America saw the greatest progress, with GHI scores decreasing by 40% or more. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest GHI scores, but South Asia has shown more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with factors like low nutritional and social status of women contributing in South Asia, while issues like government effectiveness and HIV/AIDS prevalence are major factors in sub-Saharan Africa. The Global Health Index (GHI) scores have decreased significantly in various regions, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa having the highest scores. Factors like low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV/AIDS contribute to high child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Progress in reducing the GHI has been slower in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia compared to other regions like Latin America. Many countries have not been able to reduce their scores by 50% or more over the past couple of decades. Latin America has seen varying levels of progress in reducing Global Health Index (GHI) scores over the past couple of decades. While some countries have made significant strides, others have struggled, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Factors such as conflict, political instability, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and inequality have hindered efforts to improve food security in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Swaziland, The Gambia, and Zimbabwe. In Swaziland, high HIV/AIDS prevalence and inequality have undermined food security despite higher national incomes. The Gambia saw an increase in undernourishment due to lower social protection spending. Zimbabwe's economic collapse led to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries like Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam made significant improvements in their Global Health Index scores. Ghana was the top performer in sub-Saharan Africa in improving its GHI score since 1990. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger in his inaugural address. In 1990 GHI and 2010 GHI, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam showed significant improvements in their scores. Ghana was the top performer in sub-Saharan Africa in improving its GHI score since 1990. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years for global agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in L'Aquila, Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched to combat hunger and poverty, aiming to mobilize at least $20 billion over three years. The G8 summit leaders and other countries announced the launch of the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years. The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth, along with social protection mechanisms. The G8 leaders pledged to provide sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes. The G8 leaders pledged to provide sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes, consistent with the Accra Agenda for Action. In the AAA, developing countries commit to country-led strategies, donors pledge better coordination, and both parties promise mutual accountability. The G8 supports CAADP in sub-Saharan Africa to target resources to country priorities, focusing on improving food security and increasing smallholder farmers' incomes. Established in 2003, CAADP aims to raise agricultural productivity by 6% annually and increase public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets. The CAADP program, part of NEPAD and the African Union, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and smallholder farmers' incomes by increasing agricultural productivity by 6% annually and public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets. The L'Aqulia declaration aligns with the U.N. High Level Task Force's Comprehensive Framework for Action to address immediate and long-term global food and nutrition security challenges. The Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) was established in April 2008 by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to address global food price challenges. It proposed immediate actions for vulnerable populations and longer-term strategies for global food security. The CFA called for emergency food assistance, smallholder farmer support, trade policy adjustments, and macroeconomic management. For long-term security, it suggested expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in September 2009 in Pittsburgh endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative. The CFA proposed immediate actions for vulnerable populations and longer-term strategies for global food security, including expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in September 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries. The United States also collaborated with private philanthropists to support global food security efforts. At the G20 Summit, countries including Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged an additional $2 billion to support the Global Partnership for food security. The United States collaborated with private philanthropists to coordinate food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome, where 60 heads of state endorsed the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. At the Global Partnership summit, 182 countries and the EU renewed their commitment to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported the need for a 70% increase in agricultural output to feed a growing population. The US State Department issued a document outlining priorities for global food security, leading to the launch of the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative in May 2010. The Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, renamed \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative in May 2010, issued a strategy document developed through a consultative process with various stakeholders. The initiative builds on principles for sustainable food security endorsed at the 2009 World Summit on Food Security. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, in collaboration with the global community, focuses on sustainable food security through inclusive agriculture sector growth and improving nutritional status in specific countries. It prioritizes gender, environment, and climate change, and interventions to enhance agricultural productivity and expand markets for agricultural commodities. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries. It focuses on interventions like improving agricultural productivity with technologies and inputs adapted to local conditions, expanding markets for agricultural commodities, and developing policies and infrastructure for smallholder farmers. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of men and women farmers in rural areas. Country-owned plans will drive the specific activities and investments tailored to each country's priorities. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative focuses on agriculturally-based economic growth, measuring changes in agricultural production and income levels of men and women farmers in rural areas. Activities and investments vary by country based on priorities, aiming to strengthen links between agriculture and improved nutrition outcomes. Progress in nutrition will be measured through changes in stunted and wasted children and underweight women. Coordination with host governments and other partners will be key in implementing country-specific nutrition strategies. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative collaborates with host governments and partners to implement country-specific nutrition strategies. Progress is measured by changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. Investments in regional programs, partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research are part of the initiative. Emergency food assistance remains a priority, but traditional U.S. food aid funding is not explicitly included in FtF. Currently, FtF focuses on 20 countries. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, while prioritizing emergency food assistance, does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding. It focuses on 20 countries selected based on criteria such as chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, and host government commitment. Investments will occur in two phases based on country investment plans. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative focuses on 20 countries with potential for agricultural-led growth. Investments will occur in two phases based on country investment plans. Phase 1 involves capacity-building and technical assistance for developing and implementing plans, while Phase 2 countries should have completed a plan with clear priorities and financial projections. Phase 2 countries must have completed a comprehensive country investment plan (CIP) with clear priorities, financial projections, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, and a practical implementation plan. They must also commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural development and improved nutrition. FtF will partner with selected countries and stakeholders to support the development and implementation of CIPs. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, which is 3% of the total international affairs budget. FtF plans to partner with countries to develop and implement Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) plans. The budget includes $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, which is 40% higher than the estimated FY2010 allocation. The increase is mainly due to a $408 million request for a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. Additionally, $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account are part of the food security effort but requested through the Global Health Initiative. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) is $1.64 billion, 40% higher than FY2010. The increase is mainly due to a $408 million request for a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. Additionally, there is a separate request for $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011. The Administration is requesting $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011, including funds for Food for Peace Title II, Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. There is also a call for reforming U.S. foreign aid programs to better address national security challenges and development needs. The Obama Administration launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in July 2009 to reform U.S. foreign aid programs and address national security challenges. Critics have highlighted inefficiencies and lack of alignment with national interests in U.S. aid programs. The State Department launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to reform U.S. foreign aid programs. Led by Secretary of State Clinton, the QDDR aimed to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Despite delays, the findings were released in 2010 as \"Leading Through Civilian Power,\" outlining a blueprint to elevate American \"civilian power\" for better national interests alignment. Clinton officially released the findings of the QDDR on December 15, 2010, in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power.\" The QDDR aimed to elevate American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a better partner to the U.S. military. Additionally, the Administration launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009 to review the roles and comparative advantage of U.S. government agencies involved in global development. The Administration launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009 to review the roles and comparative advantage of U.S. government agencies involved in global development. The PSD-7 aims to make U.S. development policy more effective by prioritizing economic growth and democratic principles. The National Security Council staff plays a key role in the PSD review, focusing on development, democracy, and regional issues. A draft of PSD-7 titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance. The Administration aims to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The PSD-7 was planned to be completed in 2010. The Administration aims to elevate development as a core pillar of American power through the PSD and QDDR overlap. The completion of PSD-7 has been delayed, with uncertainty on public release. President Obama's Global Development Policy Directive emphasizes the integration of development, diplomacy, and defense for national security, highlighting Global Food Security. The Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development emphasizes the integration of development, diplomacy, and defense for national security. Global Food Security is highlighted as one of the three key development initiatives. The establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security at USAID will drive food security efforts and lead the implementation of President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. Interagency coordination will be overseen by the national security staff. The USAID Administrator announced the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to drive food security efforts and lead the implementation of President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. BFS will coordinate with State Department, USDA, and others, expand partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress may face issues on agricultural development, global food security, food aid, and U.S. foreign aid reform. The U.S. pledged $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in 2009 to support the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. At the G8 Summit in L'Aquila in 2009, the President pledged $3.5 billion over three years to support global agriculture and food security. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House bill included $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, which is 38% less than the Administration's request. The Subcommittee approved a draft FY2011 funding bill with $52.81 billion, $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill with $54.22 billion, $1.40 billion less than the House subcommittee draft. The Senate bill included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs. Congress did not enact any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011. The Senate bill for FY2011 funding was $1.40 billion less than the House subcommittee draft and $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. It included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs. Congress did not pass any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, instead relying on continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and change in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities. The Administration's FY2012 request for food security and agricultural development funding may face additional debate due to the current fiscal situation and change in congressional leadership. Skepticism exists regarding the G8's pledge to provide $22 billion over three years, with only $263 million received out of the $914 million pledged for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund had a pledged amount of US$914 million as of June 2010, but only received US$263 million from donors by July 2010. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, with key positions remaining unfilled. The G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, pledged $50 billion in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa by 2009, but is reportedly $15 billion short of meeting this commitment. The delay in appointing key positions at USAID has led to a leadership vacuum, allowing other federal agencies to take on development activities traditionally under USAID's jurisdiction. Concerns have been raised about the divided development approach among different agencies undermining USAID's authority and resources. The Center for Global Development criticizes the absence of USAID in significant foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The Center for Global Development and senior government officials have raised concerns about the decline in staff capacity at USAID, questioning the divided development approach among federal agencies. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the imbalance in the national security apparatus, emphasizing the need for increased capacity. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance in the national security apparatus, pointing out the capacity issues within the military and civilian elements. The State Department and USAID have faced staffing reductions, impacting U.S. power abroad. The State Department and USAID have experienced significant staffing reductions, leading to a decrease in on-the-ground effectiveness and technical expertise. USAID has shifted from an implementation agency to one that outsources a large portion of its foreign aid program. Some experts argue that staff cuts at USAID have led to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness, loss of technical expertise, and a shift towards outsourcing foreign aid programs. This has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. USAID faces challenges in managing its agricultural development portfolio due to staff shortages. Since the 1950s, USAID has struggled with country-level fragmentation in agricultural development assistance due to staff shortages. To address this, USAID has hired additional agriculture foreign-service officers and collaborated with land-grant universities to build counterpart institutions in developing countries. Since the 1950s, USAID has collaborated with land-grant universities to establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. The role of capacity building at USAID has declined since the 1990s, leading to reduced support for agricultural research and weaker institutional capacity in partner countries. USAID's post-graduate training decreased significantly between 1989 and 2005, leading to a reduction in support for agricultural research and weaker institutional capacity in developing countries. Despite recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building, USAID has not restored funding or duration for training and capacity-building programs, raising concerns about institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries. Despite recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building, USAID has not restored funding or duration for training and capacity-building programs, raising concerns about institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa. Some have noted the weak scientific foundation in sub-Saharan Africa for developing modern agriculture, with reluctance from African governments and donors to invest in science, technology, and training to increase agricultural productivity. Several U.S. agencies are involved in formulating policy and implementing agricultural development and food security assistance, with USAID, the State Department, and USDA being the most directly involved. Several U.S. agencies, including USAID, the State Department, USDA, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Treasury Department, and the U.S. Trade Representative, are involved in formulating policy and implementing agricultural development and food security assistance. Interagency coordination in providing this assistance has been a widely discussed challenge. Interagency coordination in agricultural development and food security assistance is a significant challenge. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture and a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture to address coordination issues among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination problems between USDA and USAID in providing food aid. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture and a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture to address coordination issues among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination problems between USDA and USAID in providing food aid. The Feed the Future initiative aims to improve interagency coordination in food security efforts, but some see fragmentation and siloing of activities across government agencies as a major constraint. USAID will lead the implementation of the initiative according to the QDDR. The QDDR states that USAID will lead the implementation of the Feed the Future initiative, but details on coordination with other U.S. government entities are unclear. Bills in the 111th Congress emphasized the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. Funding implications of a whole-of-government approach have not been clearly articulated. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies recognized the need for coordination to make international aid more effective. The United States works with other donors and international bodies to harmonize strategies and activities. The 111th Congress introduced bills to enhance the U.S. role in addressing global hunger through interagency coordination. It is uncertain if these issues will be a priority in the 112th Congress. The United States collaborates with other donors and international bodies to improve the effectiveness of international aid. This includes discussions and coordination with countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union, as well as participation in global summits to establish development goals and aid strategies. Aid predictability and flexibility are key principles agreed upon by donors. Donors play a crucial role in coordinating aid, setting development goals, and mobilizing support. They have agreed to increase aid predictability and flexibility, aligning with other donors to support initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program. The U.S. Administration's global food security initiative also supports multilateral forums. The U.S. provides bilateral assistance through USAID for initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program. Some argue aid reform is slow, while others prioritize activities aligning with U.S. interests. Implementation is based on country-led planning. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes country-led planning for ensuring program relevance and sustainability. Concerns have been raised about donor control, developing countries' capacity for strategic planning, and the potential for government-led processes in the planning. Some concerns have been raised about developing countries lacking capacity for strategic planning and accountability measures required by donors. There are worries that country-led planning may turn into government-led strategies, potentially excluding civil society and private sector actors. Coordination between Feed the Future and U.S. food aid provision is not adequately addressed, despite Food for Peace Title II food aid being a significant component of U.S. food security assistance. The U.S. is implementing food aid programs in 20 Feed the Future focus countries. Questions arise on coordinating food aid with Feed the Future activities and potential adverse effects. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender and climate change, but lacks clarity on coordination with food aid provision. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. However, there is a lack of clarity on how these issues will be integrated into country plans, the resources needed, metrics to track progress, and coordination with other USG initiatives. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative is working on a results framework with key indicators to measure progress. It is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress and when results will be realized. Questions remain about achieving MDG1 in the 20 countries of the initiative and how frequently Congress will receive updates."
