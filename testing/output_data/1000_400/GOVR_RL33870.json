The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million. The President requested $216.0 million for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, with no funding for state grants. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program received $568.8 million in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program continues to operate at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. This report discusses the 107th Congress SDFSCA reauthorization and appropriations to fund the SDFSC program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program awards state grants to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. Funds also support national programs for all educational levels. $650 million was authorized for state grants in FY2002, with continued funding through FY2007. 1% of funds are reserved for specific territories. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program awards state grants to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools, supporting national programs for all educational levels. $650 million was authorized for state grants in FY2002, with continued funding through FY2007. 1% of funds are reserved for specific territories and programs for Indian youth and native Hawaiians. The remaining funds are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. No state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted or the amount received in FY2001. State grants for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program are distributed based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Each state receives a proportional share of its FY2006 grant if total appropriations are less than the FY2001 level. Funds may be redistributed if a state cannot use them within two years. A limitation exists on increasing national program funds without a 10% increase in state grant funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a provision for redistributing funds if a state cannot use them within two years. A limitation on increasing national program funds without a 10% increase in state grant funding was negated for FY2006. In FY2007, the Administration did not suggest funding for state grants. 20% of the total state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts, with a limit of 3% for administrative costs. The Administration did not propose funding for state grants in FY2007. 20% of the state allotment is allocated to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts, with a 3% limit for administrative costs. SEAs must distribute at least 93% of their allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs can use up to 2% of the state funds for administrative costs. In FY2002, funds under ESEA Title I, Part A were allocated based on school enrollments. LEAs could use up to 2% for administrative costs, while SEAs could use up to 3%. An additional 1% could be used for a management information system to collect data on truancy, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and drug use. The PART program was designed to collect data on truancy rates, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and services in schools. SEAs could use up to 5% of funds for capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement. PART is an instrument to evaluate federal programs. The Administration used the PART instrument to evaluate the state grants component of the SDFSC program in 2002 and 2006. It was deemed \"ineffective\" due to lack of program effectiveness and funds being spread too thinly. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was considered insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The Administration decided to terminate the state grants program due to funding being distributed too thinly and lack of measurable outcomes. Instead, they planned to allocate resources to higher-priority programs like national SDFSC programs, which were deemed more promising in achieving results in drug and violence prevention. The Administration proposed terminating the state grants program to fund higher-priority national SDFSC programs, which were seen as more effective in achieving results in drug and violence prevention. The Department of Education planned to use national survey data to assess progress and measure the effectiveness of these interventions. The Department of Education plans to assess progress and measure the effectiveness of state grants programs using national survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. They will also evaluate the impact of promising interventions and provide grants and technical assistance to improve data collection and analysis for SDFSC programs. Authorization for national programs is for FY2002. The Department of Education is evaluating the impact of interventions and providing grants to improve data collection for SDFSC programs. National programs aim to prevent violence and drug use among students, with funds available for evaluation and the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative. The Department of Education works with the ONDCP and the Attorney General to prevent violence and drug use among students. Up to $2 million is reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. The National Coordinator Initiative allows LEAs to hire coordinators for drug prevention and school safety programs in middle schools. NCLBA expanded this initiative to cover all schools with drug and safety issues. The NCLBA expanded the National Coordinator Initiative to include all schools with drug and safety issues. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004, with funds potentially available as formula grants to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants may also be awarded to LEAs for developing and implementing programs to reduce alcohol and drug use. A concentration grants for the preceding fiscal year ensures that no state would receive less than 0.5% of the total allotted to all states. Competitive grants may be awarded to LEAs for programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants can also support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for localities affected by hate crimes and creating a School. The curr_chunk discusses various initiatives authorized under national programs, including grants for mentoring programs in middle schools, assistance for localities affected by hate crimes, and the establishment of School Security Technology and Resource Center and National Center for School and Youth Safety. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of Rural Law Enforcement in Little Rock, Arkansas, and a National Center for School and Youth Safety to improve school security and provide emergency assistance.

Additionally, the President did not request funding for the mentoring program in FY2008, but requested $19 million for FY2007 as part of a two-year phase-out plan. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $19 million for the mentoring program in FY2007. In FY2007, the President requested $19 million for the mentoring program as part of a two-year phase-out plan. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the same amount. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, but a 1% budget reduction lowered funding to $48.8 million. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program from FY2005 to FY2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for each of FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration lowered mentoring funding to $48.8 million and did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program from FY2005 to FY2008. Congress appropriated $32.7 million for AAR for FY2005 and FY2006. Funding for AAR was slightly reduced to $32.4 million in FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR in FY2007, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million. The SDFSC program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was incorporated into the SDFSCA program, requiring states to have laws expelling students who bring weapons to school. States can allow expelled students to receive educational services in alternative settings. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements to receive GFSA funds. The GFSA allows the chief administering officer of a LEA to modify expulsion requirements on a case-by-case basis. States can permit expelled students to receive educational services in alternative settings. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements to receive GFSA funds, including reporting incidents involving firearms. LEAs must have a policy to report any student bringing a firearm to school to the criminal justice system. The GFSA requires LEAs to report any student bringing a firearm to school to the criminal justice system. Bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced during the 109th Congress, with one bill (H.R. 3010) requiring the ED Secretary to conduct a study. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, including H.R. 3010 which required a study by the ED Secretary. Other measures included H.R. 283 for Bullying and Gang Prevention and H.R. 284 for bullying and harassment under SDFSCA. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, including H.R. 3010 which required a study by the ED Secretary. Other measures introduced were H.R. 283 for Bullying and Gang Prevention, H.R. 284 for bullying and harassment under SDFSCA, H.R. 3655 for School Violence Prevention, H.R. 5295 for Student and Teacher Safety, S. 1974 for Drug Free Varsity Sports, and S. 4028 for Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth. The Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 283) and H.R. 284 were introduced during the 109th Congress to amend SDFSCA for bullying and gang prevention programs. These bills aimed to enhance school safety through research-based programs. H.R. 284, introduced in 2005, aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under the definition of violence in the SDFSCA. Additionally, the School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) directed the ED Secretary to review and revise guidelines for state and local prevention programs. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, aimed to improve state and local prevention programs by revising guidelines and allowing full-time teachers to search students under reasonable suspicion on school property. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to conduct pilot programs testing high school students for performance-enhancing drug use. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson directed the ED Secretary to award grants for statewide pilot programs testing high school students for performance-enhancing drug use. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization, and allocate funds for national programs and initiatives. The bill aimed to increase authorization levels for FY2007, allocate funds for national programs, require LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators, reserve funds for mentoring program grants, prioritize grants for high-need children in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems, and add an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant. The ED Secretary would prioritize grants for mentoring programs serving elementary and middle school children in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems. An Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant would reserve $50 million for nonprofit groups to combat gang activity in schools and communities, with priority for programs targeting teens in high-crime communities. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, is the only bill related to SDFSCA introduced in the 110th Congress. Priority would be given to applicants describing programs targeting teens in high-crime communities. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, introduced in the 110th Congress, would allow students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (H.R. 354) allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools. It provides the option of counseling or removal of the offender for victims of violent crimes on school property. H.R. 354 allows students to transfer to a safe public school within the same district if they are victims of violence on school grounds, while riding a school bus, or attending a school function. It does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and offers counseling or removal of the offender. No further action has been taken on H.R. 354, but it may be considered for reauthorization in the 110th Congress. The Administration has recommended restructuring the SDFSC program to support LEAs in creating safe, drug-free, healthy, and secure environments. In the 110th Congress, the Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to support LEAs in creating safe, drug-free, healthy, and secure school environments. This includes consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program focusing on emergency planning, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture, and other needs for improving the learning environment. Congress may also consider related SDFSCA issues. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program in the 110th Congress to support LEAs in creating safe, drug-free, healthy, and secure school environments. This includes consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program focusing on managing emergencies, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture, and other needs for improving the learning environment. Congress might consider requiring schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may be better suited to handle school safety and crime data collection instead of the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. Restructuring state grant programs related to school safety could be considered, as the current programs have been deemed ineffective by the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) assessment. This restructuring could involve shifting responsibility for programs such as illicit drug and alcohol prevention and suicide prevention. The PART assessment found state grant programs related to school safety to be ineffective. One option is to restructure the responsibility for these programs, with illicit drug and alcohol prevention remaining at ED and school safety and emergency preparedness programs under DOJ. Another possibility is allowing K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for increased security against potential terrorist attacks. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may oversee funding for school safety due to its expertise. Another option is allowing K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for increased security against terrorist attacks. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA could have unintended consequences by pressuring state education officials to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools would never meet the criteria. State education officials may feel pressured to create definitions for persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools would never meet the criteria. This could lead to legal concerns as definitions vary between states, potentially causing underreporting of school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous. This could hinder opportunities for obtaining funding for school violence prevention grants. State education officials may face pressure to define persistently dangerous schools in a manner that local schools cannot meet, leading to underreporting of school crime to avoid the label. This could limit funding opportunities for violence prevention grants, as schools without corroborating data may not qualify. Additionally, schools identified as persistently dangerous receive no funding to improve safety programs, while federal and state budgets cut funds that could prevent schools from reaching this designation."
