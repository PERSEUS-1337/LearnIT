Our proposal introduces a memory system that enhances priors in VAE-like models through adaptive memory, offering efficient online distributed writing for data compression and storage. The memory architecture extends the VAE by utilizing an adaptive memory store for deriving the prior distribution. The VAE model involves a generative model with prior and conditional distributions, approximating the intractable posterior with an inference model. Parameters are represented by \u03b8 for the generative model and \u03c6 for the inference model. The objective is to maximize log-likelihood by optimizing \u03b8 and \u03c6 for a variational lower-bound. The dataset consists of iid samples, and parameterized distributions are implemented as multivariate Gaussian distributions with diagonal covariance matrices.

Training objective is the expected conditional log-likelihood, utilizing conditional independence of x given memory M. Joint distribution is factorized into marginal distribution p(X) and posterior p(M|X), interpreting computing p(M|X) as writing X into memory. Proposal is a principled way of formulating memory-based generative models, maximizing mutual information between memory and episode. The proposed scenario introduces a general way to formulate memory-based generative models by maximizing mutual information between memory and episode. The joint distribution of the generative model can be factorized, with the memory represented as a random matrix with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution. The memory in the generative model is represented by a random matrix with a matrix variate Gaussian distribution. The distribution includes a mean matrix R, a covariance matrix U for rows, and a covariance matrix V for columns. The distribution is equivalent to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of vectorized M. Independence is assumed between columns but not rows of M, with V fixed as the identity matrix and full freedom for U. This setting balances simplicity and performance, with experiments suggesting the covariance between rows is useful for coordinating memory access.

Independence is assumed between columns but not rows of M, with V fixed as the identity matrix and full freedom for U. The addresses A are optimised through back-propagation, with the addressing variable y t used to compute weights controlling memory access. The projection f transforms y t into a key vector, and the weights w t across the rows of M are computed via a multi-layer perception (MLP).

The code z t generates samples of x t through a conditional distribution with a memory-dependent prior, resulting in a richer marginal distribution. The hierarchical model includes global latent variable M capturing episode statistics and local latent variables y t and z t capturing local statistics within an episode. The reading inference model approximates the posterior distribution using conditional independence, refining the prior distribution with additional evidence. Updating memory involves a trade-off between preserving old information and writing new information. The parameterised posterior for memory updating balances preserving old information and writing new information optimally through Bayes' rule. Memory writing is interpreted as inference, computing the posterior distribution of memory. Batch and online inference methods are considered, with the posterior distribution of memory approximated using one sample of y t, x t. The posterior distribution of memory p(M |X) is computed through batch and online inference methods. The approximated posterior distribution of memory is obtained using one sample of y t, x t. The posterior of the addressing variable q \u03c6 (y t |x t) and code q \u03c6 (z t |x t) are parameterized distributions. The posterior of memory p \u03b8 (M |Y, Z) is analytically tractable in the linear Gaussian model. The posterior distribution of memory in the linear Gaussian model is analytically tractable. The parameters R and U can be updated using Bayes' rule, with prior parameters trained through back-propagation. This allows the prior of memory to learn the dataset's general structure, while the posterior is updated accordingly. The update rule for the posterior distribution of memory in the linear Gaussian model involves inverting a covariance matrix \u03a3z with a complexity of O(T^3). To reduce per-step cost, online updating can be used by updating one sample at a time. This is equivalent to updating using the entire episode at once iteratively. The cost of updating the memory in the linear Gaussian model can be reduced by performing online updates using one sample at a time. This is equivalent to updating the entire episode iteratively. Another major cost is the storage and multiplication of the row-covariance matrix U, with a complexity of O(K^2). Although reducing this covariance to diagonal can lower the cost to O(K), experiments show it is beneficial for memory access coordination. Future work may explore low-rank approximations of U for better cost-performance balance. To train the model, a variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood is optimized. Sampling is used to approximate the inner expectation for computational efficiency. A mean-field approximation is employed for memory, using the mean R instead of memory samples to avoid costly Cholesky decomposition. Further exploration of low-rank approximations of U is suggested for improved cost-performance balance. To optimize the variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood, sampling is used to approximate the inner expectation. A mean-field approximation is used for memory, with the mean R replacing memory samples to avoid expensive Cholesky decomposition. The memory learns useful representations without relying on complex addresses, and iterative reading mechanisms are employed for efficient operations. The memory-based model uses iterative reading to improve denoising and sampling by feeding back the reconstruction multiple times. This iterative process helps decrease errors and converges to stored memory, similar to Kanerva's sparse distributed memory. The iterative reading process in the model improves denoising and sampling by feeding back the reconstruction multiple times, converging to stored memory. This process utilizes knowledge about memory to enhance reading, suggesting the use of q \u03c6 (y t |x t , M ) instead of q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) for addressing. Despite the high cost of training a parameterized model with the whole matrix M as input, intractable posteriors can be efficiently approximated using loopy belief-propagation. This approach is effective in modeling the local coupling between x t and y t, leading to improved performance in the model. The model implementation details are described in Appendix C, using encoder and decoder models to evaluate the adaptive memory improvements. The same model architecture is used for experiments with Omniglot and CIFAR datasets, varying only the number of filters, memory size, and code size.

It consists of fixed addresses A pointing to a modifiable memory M, both with the same size of K \u00d7 D. Inputs are compared with addresses through Hamming distance, where all inputs are uniform random vectors. The sparse distributed memory system by Kanerva involves comparing inputs with fixed addresses through Hamming distance. Addresses are randomly sampled to reflect input statistics, and selected based on a threshold. Patterns are stored in memory by updating memory contents, and reading involves summing selected addresses. This process can be iterated multiple times.

However, the application of his model is hindered by the assumption of a uniform and binary data distribution, which is rarely true in real-world scenarios. Our model architecture includes a convolutional encoder for image input conversion into embedding vectors, enhancing efficiency compared to standard VAEs. Our model architecture includes a convolutional encoder to convert input images into 2C embedding vectors, where C is the code size. The encoder consists of 3 blocks with convolutional layers and a ResNet block, followed by linear projection to a 2C dimensional vector. The decoder mirrors this structure with transposed convolutional layers and MLP boxes with ReLU non-linearity. Adding noise to the input into q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) helps stabilize training. The blocks are flattened and projected to a 2C dimensional vector. The convolutional decoder mirrors this structure with transposed convolutional layers. Adding noise to the input helps stabilize training. Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.2 is used for all experiments. Different likelihood functions are used for different datasets. The DNC is wrapped with the same interface as the Kanerva memory for fair comparison. To prevent Gaussian likelihood collapsing in CIFAR, uniform noise U(0, 1/256) is added to images during training. The differentiable neural computer (DNC) is wrapped with the same interface as Kanerva memory for fair comparison. DNC processes addressing variable y_t and input z_t during writing, with separated reading and writing stages in experiments. In experiments with the differentiable neural computer (DNC), the writing and reading processes were separated to avoid interference with DNC's external memory. A 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity was used as the controller instead of LSTM to prevent the recurrent state from being used as memory. To focus on memory performance, the DNC was configured to only read-out from its memory, avoiding output bypassing the memory. The issue with off-the-shelf DNC controllers is that they may generate output bypassing the memory, which can be confusing in our auto-encoding setting. To avoid this, we remove the controller output to ensure the DNC only reads from its memory. We focus on memory performance by comparing models using full covariance matrices to those using diagonal covariance matrices. The models with full covariance matrices were slightly slower per-iteration but had a quicker decrease in test loss.
