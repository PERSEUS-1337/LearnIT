The Global Free Internet Act of 2012 emphasizes the importance of a single, open, global Internet for the free flow of information and products. It supports policies that encourage technology standards, respect user privacy, promote innovation, and avoid restricting Internet service providers. The Global Free Internet Act of 2012 aims to respect user privacy, promote innovation, and prevent restrictions on Internet service providers. Certain governments and international bodies are adopting policies that go against the goal of a free, open Internet. Policies contrary to a free, open Internet include mandating unique technology standards favoring domestic producers, sponsoring unauthorized access to networks, and discriminating against Internet-based services from other countries. The United States faces threats from foreign governments attempting to disrupt private-sector networks, restrict Internet communications, monitor online activities, and impose discriminatory market access requirements. These actions jeopardize individual privacy, freedom, and the interests of the United States. Foreign governments imposing discriminatory market access requirements or liabilities that impede Internet-related goods, services, and content threaten the interests of the United States by facilitating attempts to restrict the free flow of information, promoting conflicting \"national Internets,\" and harming US workers and businesses. The curr_chunk discusses the potential consequences of compromising the Internet's functionality, harming US workers and businesses, undermining the industrial base, and putting foreign competitors at an advantage. It also highlights the risk of limiting the Internet's utility for open communication, assembly, and commerce. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Task Force on the Global Internet.
