Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. This report details the history of UCLASS requirements development and changes over time. The U.S. Navy's UCLASS aircraft has faced controversy and delays in determining final requirements. In 1999, research began on an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) by the Navy and DARPA. The Navy's UCAV was designed for reconnaissance missions in protected airspace to identify targets for manned attack waves. The Navy's UCAV program, known as N-UCAV, was designed for reconnaissance missions in protected airspace to identify targets for manned attack waves. Northrop Grumman independently built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under the program. In 2003, the Office of the Secretary of Defense mandated the Navy and Air Force merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program to capitalize on potential synergy. The Office of the Secretary of Defense directed the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program called Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) in 2003. The program aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and military value of a networked system of unmanned air vehicles for various missions including SEAD, electronic attack, precision strike, surveillance, and persistent global attack in denied enemy territory. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program aimed to demonstrate the military value of a networked system of high-performance unmanned air vehicles for missions in denied enemy territory. The program was terminated in 2006, leading to the development of the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) for carrier-based operations. The Navy developed the N-UCAS program to create an unmanned carrier-based aircraft with greater standoff capability and increased reach. The program included the UCAS-D initiative to demonstrate the feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier, which was successfully achieved in 2013. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program to demonstrate unmanned air combat systems' feasibility on an aircraft carrier. This led to the approval of the UCLASS acquisition program in 2011, aiming to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance naval air defenses. The UCLASS acquisition program, approved in 2011, aimed to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance naval air defenses. The program focused on developing a carrier-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance asset with precision strike capabilities. The UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document was approved by JROC in 2011 to create a carrier-based ISR and precision strike asset. However, in 2012, JROC revised the requirements for UCLASS, prioritizing ISR capabilities over strike capabilities due to budget constraints. The Navy's next generation carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle's strike capability was reduced due to budget constraints, according to Dyke Weatherington, the Pentagon's director of unmanned warfare and ISR. JROCMs 086-12 and 196-12 redefined the scope of the program to prioritize affordability and adaptability. The JROC emphasized affordability as the top priority in a 2012 memorandum, establishing an affordability Key Performance Parameter for the program. The Office of the Secretary of Defense emphasized affordability as the top priority for the UCLASS program in a 2012 memorandum. The Capability Development Document set a Key Performance Parameter for the recurring fly-away cost of air vehicles. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals for the UCLASS system, focusing on affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals for the UCLASS system in 2014, emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The program aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability for eliminating targets of opportunity. The UCLASS system aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability. The design allows for growth to operate in contested environments and expand missions to include precision strike, extended range intelligence, surveillance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. The timeline for procurement of UCLASS remains unclear. The Secretary of the Navy envisions an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in contested environments, with extended range intelligence, surveillance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness missions. Delays in the UCLASS program have been caused by changes in requirements, leading to a review of airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing future. The procurement timeline has been adjusted, with the air system contract now expected to be awarded in fiscal year 2017. The Navy's UCLASS schedule has been delayed due to changes in requirements, leading to a review of airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing future. The air system contract award is now expected in fiscal year 2017, with early operational capability not expected until fiscal year 2022. Milestone A review is also delayed to fiscal year 2017. The Navy's UCLASS program schedule has been delayed, with the Milestone A review now expected in fiscal year 2017, around 3 years later than the previous review. The program may undergo further reviews and changes in requirements as it progresses."
