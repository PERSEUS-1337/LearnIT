    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017\" or the \"LOVE Act of 2017\". During the Lavender Scare in the 1950s and 1960s, over 1,000 Department of State employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. The Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security forced employees out based on their sexual orientation, citing security risks. Many patriotic Americans were also barred from joining the Department due to a screening process targeting individuals who appeared to be gay or lesbian. Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State faced scrutiny from Congress regarding the presence of homosexuals sympathetic to Communism and vulnerable to blackmail, leading to discriminatory hiring practices and wrongful dismissals. Government Agencies pressured the Department of State through the appropriations process due to concerns about homosexuals sympathetic to Communism. Between 1950 and 1969, the Department had to report on the number of homosexuals fired annually. The \"Lavender Scare\" led to discriminatory practices, with investigations into gay personnel as security risks continuing into the 1990s. In 1994, Secretary of State Warren Christopher prohibited discrimination within the Department. In the early 1990s, the Department of State investigated and removed gay personnel as security risks.
