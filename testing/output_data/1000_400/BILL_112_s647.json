Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior has conveyed mineral rights in large coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana. The development of these tracts and other energy resources in the surrounding areas generates significant public revenues for the State, aiding in addressing the impacts of development on the Northern Cheyenne tribal community. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe does not benefit from the public revenues generated by surrounding energy development, leading to economic hardships and lack of revenue sources to address development impacts. In 2002, the Tribe sued the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State.
