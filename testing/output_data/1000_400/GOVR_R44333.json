    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care provision are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax status to certain forms of income, resulting in foregone revenue. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, and impact since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation, focusing on the value of these tax expenditures, changes over time, and their relationship to total revenue collected. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation, focusing on budget function level analysis rather than individual provisions. For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and for broader analysis, see CRS Report R44012. The curr_chunk discusses tax expenditures defined by the Joint Committee on Taxation, based on the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It relies on a modified Haig-Simons baseline for estimation methodology. The Joint Committee on Taxation defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from special provisions in Federal tax laws. These provisions diverge from the modified Haig-Simons income baseline, resulting in forgone revenue. JCT estimates tax expenditures each session of Congress. Certain tax provisions result in revenue losses under different forms of taxation, with only income tax revenue forgone included in JCT's estimates. JCT categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. The Department of the Treasury categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, including health, commerce, and energy. The health budget function used by JCT for tax expenditures is broader than that used for outlays by agencies like OMB, due to historical practices and the complexity of cross-cutting health provisions. Health tax expenditures are categorized by budget area and analyzed based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act. Economists evaluate them for economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, adding value to Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures are categorized based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity criteria. They can impact economic distortions and certain groups of people. For example, health insurance tax expenditures can correct some market inefficiencies but create others. Exclusions and deductions in tax expenditures may affect tax progressivity. Administrative considerations play a role in social policy targeted at lower-income individuals. Tax expenditures in the form of exclusions and deductions could impact tax progressivity based on the top marginal income tax rate. Administering social programs through the tax code may have advantages for lower-income households but could increase complexity and costs. Direct spending or grant programs could be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures. Tax administration costs can be reduced by administering tax expenditures as direct spending or grant programs. JCT identifies 14 health tax expenditures, with the largest being the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion. Medicare-related provisions were previously included but are no longer part of the estimates. References to health-related tax provisions include both health and Medicare tax expenditures before FY2015. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion, with the largest tax expenditure being the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). The second largest expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges. These tax expenditures serve various purposes and have a long history in the tax code. The annual tax expenditure amount for advance premium tax credits (APTCs) is projected to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. Health-related tax expenditures subsidize private health insurance costs and activities with positive societal benefits. Older health tax provisions continue to have significant policy effects and size. Some older health tax provisions have origins in legal doctrine or definitions of income at the time of adoption, and may have been indirectly affected by other policies. These provisions, like the itemized deduction for charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations, are subcomponents of larger categories of activity. The breadth of these older tax provisions may have been difficult to imagine during their enactment, given the larger exemptions of the earliest forms of the income tax. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible. Its role expanded significantly during and after World War II due to administrative decisions and policies that froze wages but not fringe benefits. Regulatory rulings on employer health contributions were conflicting under the Internal Revenue Code revision of 1954. The ESI tax exclusion, established in 1918, allowed employer health contributions to be deductible. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 expanded this exclusion, explicitly excluding these contributions from income. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 show changes in provisions over time. The number of provisions within the health category of tax expenditures has changed over time, as provisions have expired or been added. JCT does not typically add multiple tax expenditure values together, as interactions between multiple provisions could mean that the value of tax expenditures estimated as a group is not the same as the value of the sum of individual tax expenditure estimates. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased over time, with a 43.0% increase from FY2004 to FY2014. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars and 7.5% in real dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. From FY2004 to FY2014, health-related tax expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms. The annual value of health tax expenditures is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with a net growth attributed to factors like changes in demographics. Tax expenditures are projected to rise from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with health tax expenditures totaling $234.0 billion in FY2016. The growth in health-related tax expenditures is influenced by factors like demographic changes, increasing health care costs, and policy changes affecting costs. Medicare-related tax expenditures were previously calculated based on benefits exceeding insurance payments, excluding all Medicare benefits from income tax. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as the value of benefits exceeding insurance payments, excluding all Medicare benefits from income tax. Positive tax expenditures for Medicare Part D indicated that insurance value exceeded premiums paid. These expenditures increased over time, with estimates showing minimal values before FY1987. The value of Medicare insurance benefits exceeded payments, leading to increased tax expenditures over time. From FY1987 to FY2014, tax expenditure values for Medicare provisions increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) annually. JCT estimated that Medicare provisions accounted for 26.8% of health tax expenditures in FY2014, up from 1.9% in FY1974. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased over the years, surpassing total revenue collections. In FY2014, these expenditures were estimated to be 26.8% of health tax expenditures, up from 1.9% in FY1974. The trend shows a continuous rise in health tax expenditures, reaching 8.4% of total revenue in FY2014. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are projected to be 7.7% of total revenue. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased over the years, surpassing total revenue collections. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are projected to be 7.7% of total revenue. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue, such as the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. These taxes contribute to the overall revenue but are small compared to the total value of health tax expenditures. The annual revenue raised by health-related tax expenditures is small compared to total revenue collections. OMB's health budget function organizes discretionary and mandatory outlays, along with health-related tax expenditures as a share of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The comparison between OMB's health budget function and JCT's categories for tax expenditures shows differences in activities and measurement of changes in expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures in the health sector can track federal support over time. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, while administrative costs are funded through discretionary spending. Federal health research and veterans' health care are primarily funded through discretionary spending. The largest federal health programs, Medicare and Medicaid costs, are mostly mandatory outlays. Administrative costs are funded through discretionary spending. Federal health research and veterans' health care are funded through discretionary spending as well. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were still less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory outlays for health have increased over the years as a percentage of GDP. Mandatory outlays for health, including funding for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, have increased as a percentage of GDP over the years. Health-related tax expenditures have also grown, but from a smaller base. Health discretionary outlays remained relatively stable as a percentage of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) provides a brief description and legislative origins of health tax expenditure provisions. These provisions, some of the longest-standing in the Internal Revenue Code, may have had different historical rationales for their creation. They could stem from past legal definitions, income considerations, or administrative rulings.
