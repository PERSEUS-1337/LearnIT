Congress finds that bullying and harassment in schools can seriously harm students' physical and psychological health, leading to academic issues such as high dropout rates and absenteeism. These behaviors include physical violence, name-calling, intimidation, social exclusion, and cyberbullying. Students who participate in educational activities at schools may experience bullying and harassment through various means such as physical violence, name-calling, social exclusion, and cyberbullying. Schools with anti-bullying policies see increased reporting and teacher intervention, leading to a reduction in such incidents. Bullying and harassment often target students based on factors like race, gender, disability, and sexual orientation. Interventions to address bullying and harassment in schools aim to create a positive and safe school climate, utilizing evidence-based discipline policies and practices like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Students, particularly those targeted based on race, gender, disability, or sexual orientation, may experience relational aggression or psychological bullying, damaging their relationships with peers and feelings of social acceptance. Interventions to address bullying and harassment in schools, including creating a positive and safe school climate with evidence-based discipline policies like PBIS, can reduce exclusionary discipline practices. 85% of Americans support a Federal law to prevent bullying, showing a call for leadership to address this national crisis. The Safe Schools Improvement Act aims to address bullying and harassment in public elementary and secondary schools by implementing anti-bullying policies.

The Safe Schools Improvement Act mandates local educational agencies to provide annual notice about prohibited conduct and grievance procedures for complaints regarding bullying and harassment. This includes specifying responsible officials and establishing timelines for complaint resolution. The local educational agency officials responsible for receiving complaints must establish timelines for resolving them. Data on prohibited conduct must be collected annually at the school level and publicly reported, ensuring victims or perpetrators are not identifiable.

The report should include information from local educational agencies on prohibited conduct and describe the State's plans to support local educational agency efforts in addressing such conduct.
