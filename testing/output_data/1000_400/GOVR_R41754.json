    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program and Section 108 loan guarantees. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account administered by HUD. The Administration's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Community Development Block Grant program is the largest federal source of financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities. Grants are allocated to various entities for implementing revitalization plans. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This represents 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested by the agency for FY2013. The proposed budget would increase funding for CDF account activities by 4.5% or $135 million. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This represents 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested by the agency. The proposed budget would increase funding for CDF account activities by 4.5% or $135 million, with funding allocated for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and transferring funds for Section 4 capacity building activities. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This represents 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested by the agency. The Administration is requesting $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, transferring funds for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program, and maintaining funding for CDBG formula grants at the same level as FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 budget includes $2.948.1 billion for the CDBG formula component of the CDF account, with $2.059 billion for CDBG entitlement communities, $882 million for CDBG state administered program, and $7 million for insular areas. Additionally, $60 million is requested for Indian tribes, and $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, reinstating funding for SCI program activities. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) is a planning-oriented grant program proposed by the Obama Administration, with funding at $150 million in FY2010 and a request for $100 million in FY2013. The funds would support three components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and reforming existing building. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) proposed by the Obama Administration would involve collaboration with DOT, EPA, and other federal agencies. Grant awards would focus on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. $46 million would be competitively awarded to up to 50 communities for reforming building codes and zoning ordinances. $8 million would be allocated for research on the benefits and trade-offs of various efforts by HUD, DOT, and EPA. The Obama Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative involves collaboration with DOT, EPA, and other federal agencies. Grant awards focus on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. $8 million is allocated for research on the benefits and trade-offs of various efforts by HUD, DOT, and EPA, including evaluating the long-term benefits of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. Additionally, $3 million is requested for technical support in developing residential energy modeling systems, common energy standards, and sources of funding for energy efficiency improvements. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for economic development, housing, public facilities, and infrastructure projects. The program aims to attract private capital for energy efficiency improvements and job creation. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, public facilities, and infrastructure projects. The program aims to support job creation and meet national goals. The loan commitment ceiling may double from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million in FY2013. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, public facilities, and infrastructure projects. The program aims to support job creation and meet national goals. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million in FY2013, with a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed a fee-based assessment for borrowers accessing the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. S. 2322 also supports $60 million funding for Indian tribes and restores funding for SCI activities. The bill S. 2322 recommends $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants in FY2013, supporting $60 million funding for Indian tribes and restoring funding for SCI activities. The bill also proposes converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The bill would allocate $12.5 million to SCI in communities with populations less than 500,000. It supports converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The Senate committee recommends funding Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program to a different account. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations act, recommending $3.404 billion for CDF activities. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012, recommending $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation and supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for SCI activities. The House bill, H.R. 5972, supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes but does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for SCI activities. It recommends $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards. The bill does not support the Administration's budget request for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure, instead recommending $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million. The House Financial Services Committee's bill, H.R. 5972, does not support the Administration's budget request to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure. It recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million and continues funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The bill also opposes transferring the program from its current account. Amendments to reduce or eliminate funding for CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were introduced during floor debate but were not approved. The full House began floor consideration of the bill on June 27, 2012. Several amendments were introduced during the debate, including reducing funds for salaries and expenses in the Community Planning and Development account, reducing funding for the CDF, eliminating funding for the CDF, and eliminating funding for the Section 108 loan guarantee program. None of these amendments were approved. During the FY2012 budget debate, multiple amendments to reduce or eliminate funding for various programs, including the CDF and Section 108 loan guarantee program, were defeated by Congress. Additionally, an amendment to allocate more funds for demolition activities under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program was challenged and ruled out of order as it sought to change existing law. Congress aimed to reduce federal spending to address the deficit. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress focused on reducing federal spending to address the deficit while considering the Administration's budget recommendations. Supporters of the CDBG program highlighted its role in supporting economic development and job creation, vowing to defend it against funding cuts. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by minimizing activities not directly related to the CDBG program in its FY2012 budget recommendations. This included reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for NI and EDI programs, eliminating funding for Section 107 activities, transferring SCI to a new account, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The Administration's budget for FY2012 proposed significant changes to the CDF account, including reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, ending Section 107 activities, transferring SCI to a new account, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The total funding level recommended was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration also requested an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components. The Administration's budget for FY2012 proposed changes to the CDF account, including reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and ending certain programs. The requested increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities was 11.5%, with additional funds allocated for insular areas, Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and Guam. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $23 million for Guam, beyond its usual grant amount, to address community development needs due to military relocations. The budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, as the Administration opposed earmarking these funds. Additionally, the budget recommended transferring SCI programs to a new account with a requested appropriation of $150 million to support Regional Integrated Planning Grants. The Administration's FY2012 budget recommended transferring SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with an appropriation of $150 million. Funds would support Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The Administration's budget proposed increasing funding for sustainable community development programs, including Community Challenge Grants and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The budget suggested doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration proposed increasing funding for sustainable community development programs, including Community Challenge Grants and Housing-Transportation Integration Research, from $250 million in FY2011 to $500 million in FY2012. The proposed increase aimed to assist local governments in financing job creation activities. Congress rejected the proposal to charge a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program, opting to maintain the status quo. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities in FY2012. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities in FY2012, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft report noted the recommendation to eliminate the program in the FY2012 Budget Resolution, but the draft bill did not eliminate funding for the CDBG program. The draft bill recommended shifting funding priorities for the CDF program in FY2012, including eliminating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes. It emphasized that states and local communities should use more of their own taxes for community development activities to increase transparency and accountability. The draft bill proposed changes to CDF funding priorities in FY2012, including eliminating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes. It recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees and lowering the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG. The bill recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees and lowering the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a substantial reduction in CDF funding for FY2012, with an overall funding decline to $3.0 billion. The Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012, S. 1596 recommended a significant reduction in the CDF account, with overall funding declining to $3.0 billion. The bill proposed $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. Additionally, $90 million was recommended for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, $60 million less than requested by the President. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment (S.Amdt. 738) on October 13, 2011. The Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012 recommended a reduction in funding levels compared to FY2011. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate appropriations measures into a Minibus bill, which was approved by the Senate. Among the approved amendments was one proposed by Senator Coburn to prohibit the use of grants for repaying federal loans. The Senate approved a Minibus bill on November 1, 2011, including an amendment by Senator Coburn to prevent grants from being used to repay federal loans. This amendment affects the CDBG program and its Section 108 loan guarantee program. The House requested a conference on H.R. 2112 on November 3, 2011, to reconcile differences between the House and Senate. The House and Senate approved the conference version of H.R. 2112 on November 17, 2011, which was signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. The law allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, with $300 million designated for CDBG disaster activities. The funds were primarily allocated for core CDBG programs, including $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants. The CDF activities were funded by P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, with $3.308 billion allocated, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The core CDBG programs received $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas. The funding for CDBG formula grants was 10.7% less than FY2011, 19.6% less than the President's request, and 15% less than the House recommendation, but 3.4% more than the Senate recommendation. Other CDF activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative were not directly funded for FY2012, but could be carried out with CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The CDF activities funded in FY2012 were 15% less than recommended by the House and 3.4% more than recommended by the Senate. Funding for other programs like the Sustainable Communities Initiative was not directly funded, reflecting congressional efforts to reduce federal spending. The act did not include provisions to prohibit the use of federal grants for repaying loans or to reduce the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses. The Senate version of H.R. 2112 included a provision to prohibit federal grants from being used to repay federal loans, and the House recommended reducing the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses. The act also required a study on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs and a progress report on grantee accountability efforts by HUD. The act P.L. 112-55 required a study to be completed by HUD within 180 days and a progress report within 120 days on grantee accountability. It also maintained the current structure of the Section 108 loan guarantees program and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies. The Administration failed to gain congressional support for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program for the third year in a row. P.L. 112-55 maintained the program's structure and allocated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in loan guarantee commitments. The act also prohibited states from diverting proceeds from Section 108 loan guarantees to other communities. Additionally, $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance was included in P.L. 112-55 to aid states and local governments in disaster recovery efforts. P.L. 112-55 allocated $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance to aid states and local governments in disaster recovery efforts. Funds were to be used for long-term recovery plans, including housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Eligible recipients had to submit a disaster recovery plan detailing fund usage. HUD could waive provisions governing CDBG fund use. The Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers required states and local governments to submit disaster recovery plans to receive funds. The HUD could waive certain provisions for CDBG fund use, except for fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. $100 million of the $400 million allocated for disaster relief was exempted from spending limits. On April 15, 2011, the President signed into law P.L. 112-10. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 included a provision appropriating $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a mandatory across-the-board rescission of 0.2% and a discretionary transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The Secretary of HUD was granted authority to reduce the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% below the amount appropriated for FY2010. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a 0.2% rescission and a 1% transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The Secretary of HUD had the authority to reduce the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, which was 16% lower than the FY2010 amount. The CDF, including the Community Development Block Grant program, faced significant budget reductions in earlier legislative proposals. The House-passed bill, H.R. 1, aimed to reduce funding for the CDBG program by 62.5% below the FY2010 level as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. However, the bill did not receive Senate approval. An alternative measure in the Senate, S.Amdt. 149, also failed to pass. The House-passed bill, H.R. 1, aimed to cut funding for the CDBG program by 62.5% but did not receive Senate approval. An alternative Senate measure, S.Amdt. 149, also failed to pass. After negotiations, President Obama signed P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 on April 15, 2011. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, P.L. 112-10, was passed to avoid a government shutdown. It allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. Additionally, there was a 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer from HUD funds to the Transformation Initiative. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $3.501 billion for CDF activities, with a 0.2% mandatory rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account by $7 million and transferred $35 million to the Transformation Initiative. Table 3 shows the adjusted appropriations for CDF activities, including the actual distribution of funds for FY2010 and the projected distribution for FY2011 based on H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149. The CDF account received $3.501 billion for FY2011, which is 21.3% less than the previous year and 20.1% less than the Administration's request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, which provides grants to various entities. The CDF account, funded at $3.501 billion for FY2011, includes the CDBG program for grants to different entities. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for Sustainable Communities Initiative activities by 33%. H.R. 1 proposed a 66.3% reduction in the CDF account for FY2011. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) by 33%. The bill proposed a 66.3% cut in the CDF account for FY2011, prohibiting funds for earmarks and SCI. It did not specify how funds should be allocated among CDBG program components. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) by 33% and proposing a 66.3% cut in the CDF account for FY2011. The bill did not specify how funds should be allocated among CDBG program components, which include entitlement communities, states, insular areas, Indian tribes, and other programs. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1 for Senate consideration, but it was defeated. Senator Inouye's amendment to H.R. 1 for FY2011 appropriations included $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion allocated to the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level of $3.943 billion for states and entitlement communities, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. Additionally, the Senate bill would have maintained funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, University Community Fund, and SCI programs at their FY2010 levels. The FY2011 appropriations for the CDBG program aimed to freeze funding at the FY2010 level of $3.943 billion for states and entitlement communities, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. Funding for formula-based components decreased from FY2010 to FY2012, with entitlement communities receiving $2.942 billion in FY2012, a 10.7% decrease from FY2011. The CDBG allocations for entitlement communities and states totaled $2.942 billion in FY2012, a 10.7% decrease from FY2011. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined by 29.1% from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012. The average state allocation also decreased by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. The reductions in funding were less than the 62.5% reduction proposed in H.R. 1. The number of communities qualifying for entitlement status increased, with a 25.4% decline in average state allocation from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting economic development, job creation, public facilities, and services. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting private sector economic development, job creation, public facilities, and services. This would also undercut resources for non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded public services, facilities, and activities benefiting low and moderate income households. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program disproportionately affects low and moderate income households, with the FY2012 appropriations being the lowest in over a decade. This will lead to delays and reductions in projects for entitlement communities, including support for community-based organizations. Table 5 shows the actual distribution of CDBG formula funds awarded to states and entitlement communities. Table 5 displays the actual distribution of CDBG formula funds to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. The allocations were reduced in FY2011 by 16.4% and in FY2012 by 25.1% compared to FY2010 levels. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 reduced CDBG formula allocations to states and entitlement communities by 16.4% below FY2010 levels. FY2012 allocations, authorized by P.L. 112-55, decreased CDBG formula allocations by 25.1% below FY2011 amounts. 70% of CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% goes to states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities. CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities and states based on two formulas. Formula A, established in 1974, considers factors like population, poverty, and overcrowded housing for metropolitan cities and urban counties. The Community Development Act of 1974, P.L. 93-383, allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on weighted factors like population, poverty, and overcrowded housing. Formula B, enacted in 1977, allocates funds based on factors including population growth lag and poverty levels. The Development Amendments of 1977, P.L. 95-128, allocate funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on factors like population growth lag, poverty levels, and housing built before 1940. The distribution of funds to states is governed by a two formula system, Formula A and Formula B, which consider factors such as population, poverty, overcrowded housing, and poverty housing built before 1940. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system, with Formula A using population, poverty, and overcrowded housing to allocate funds, and Formula B using poverty housing built before 1940 and persons living in poverty. HUD uses Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey for allocations starting from FY2012. HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey for CDBG fund allocations starting from FY2012, allowing for more accurate reflection of demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census for data sources. HUD will use more recent Census Bureau data for CDBG fund allocations starting from FY2012, impacting communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and other regions. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions may be negatively impacted by the change in data sources for CDBG fund allocations, experiencing declines in their allocations. On the other hand, communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions are expected to see increases in their CDBG allocations due to the new data sources. Communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions would see positive impacts from the change in data sources for CDBG allocations. Entitlement communities in these regions would experience increases in their allocations, with principal cities and urban counties receiving a greater share of funds. However, other entitlement cities would see a decline in funding. States like New Mexico and Puerto Rico would experience the largest decline in funding due to decreases in their relative shares of poverty and overcrowded housing. The report discusses changes in CDBG funding allocations, with urban counties seeing an increase in poverty shares and satellite cities experiencing a decrease in overcrowding. New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest funding declines due to decreases in poverty and overcrowded housing shares. The report also includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the primary components of the CDF account. The report reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, focusing on CDBG formula grants, set-asides, and special appropriations. Total appropriations fluctuated between $3.772 billion in FY2007 to $5.112 billion in FY2001. FY2011 saw the lowest appropriations in over a decade, with debates on increasing funding for the CDBG-formula component. The FY2011 appropriation for CDF activities is the lowest in over a decade, with debates focusing on increasing funding for the CDBG-formula component due to a decline in appropriations and an increased number of communities gaining entitlement status. Critics argue that increased funding is necessary. The CDBG program has faced criticism for increased funding despite declining grant amounts to entitlement communities. Critics argue that the program's funding is not justified, especially with the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to address the federal budget deficit and national debt. From FY2000 to FY2010, the average grant amount allocated to entitlement communities decreased by 26.7%, reaching a low of $2.1 million in FY2008. The average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from FY2000 to FY2010, reaching a low of $2.1 million in FY2008. The total amount appropriated declined annually from FY2001 to FY2008 but has been increasing from FY2009 to FY2010. However, the average allocation increased by 9% since FY2008, from $2.2 million to $2.4 million in FY2010. The FY2011 estimated average allocation of $1.9 million is 34.5% less than the amount appropriated in FY2000, attributed to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from FY2000 to FY2010, reaching a low of $2.1 million in FY2008. The number of entitlement communities increased from 1,012 to 1,167 from FY2000 to FY2011. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, which was 7.4% less than in FY2000. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities. This was 7.4% less than the $1.271 billion made available to states in FY2000, but 7.6% more than allocated to states for FY2009. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before rebounding to $23.2 in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation of $19.1 million reverses that upward trend. Program funding declined by 40% from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. The allocation for CDBG formula grants has decreased significantly over the years, with a 23.3% decrease from FY2000 and a 17.7% decrease from the FY2010 average state allocation. In inflation-adjusted constant dollars, program funding dropped by 40% from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. The CDF includes various programs with smaller funding levels and specific objectives, some of which complement the larger formula grant program. The CDF account includes set-asides intended to complement the larger formula grant program, meet agency objectives, or fund specific projects. Funding for set-aside programs fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with appropriations ranging from $647 million in FY2001 to $61 million in FY2007. Congress eliminated all earmarks in the CDF account in FY2007 but appropriated $509 million for set-aside activities in FY2010, with a focus on Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI) earmark accounts. In FY2007, Congress eliminated all earmarks in the CDF account, but in FY2010, $509 million was appropriated for CDF set-aside activities, with a focus on EDI and NI earmark accounts. Funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs and earmarked accounts. In FY2007, Congress eliminated all earmarks in the CDF account. In FY2010, $509 million was appropriated for CDF set-aside activities, focusing on EDI and NI earmark accounts. Funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs and earmarked accounts. The CDF account allows decisions on funding programs, reducing funding for specific programs, and determining the amount to fund programs like EDI and NI. Earmarked projects funded by EDI and NI programs were dominant in CDBG-related set aside appropriations. In FY2007, Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account. Funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated in subsequent years, with EDI and NI earmarks dominating CDBG-related appropriations. Earmarks have been a topic of debate in recent Congresses, with new rules governing disclosure of earmark requests implemented since FY2007. In FY2007, Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account. Subsequently, new rules were implemented for disclosure of earmark requests.
