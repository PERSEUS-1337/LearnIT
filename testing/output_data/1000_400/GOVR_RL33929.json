    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The vouchers cover the difference between rent and the tenant's expected contribution (30% of adjusted income), with costs varying based on tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards. The cost of a Section 8 voucher to a Public Housing Agency (PHA) is determined by the tenant's actual rent or the maximum subsidy level set by the PHA, and 30% of the tenant's income. Changes in tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards impact this cost. Recent changes in voucher renewal funding distribution have caused funding uncertainty for many PHAs, prompting Congress to consider permanent funding formula changes through Section 8 voucher reform legislation. The changes in voucher renewal funding distribution have caused uncertainty for many PHAs, leading Congress to consider permanent funding formula changes through Section 8 voucher reform legislation starting in FY2003. PHAs were previously funded based on their per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, and multiplied by the number of vouchers leased. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs were able to lease 100% of their vouchers. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers. Low utilization rates were a major concern for Congress as national voucher utilization rates were just over 91% in FY2000 and FY2001. PHAs typically had low budget utilization as well, meaning they had more money in their budgets than needed, rarely dipping into their reserves even if costs rose significantly. HUD and each PHA would reconcile their budgets at the end of the year. PHAs had low budget utilization rates, resulting in excess funds in their budgets. HUD would reconcile budgets at year-end and recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves. HUD used a formula to request funding from Congress for Section 8 vouchers, increasing funding along with costs for PHAs. Unused funds were made available for rescission to Congress. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for PHAs to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and better reflect actual voucher usage, resulting in lower appropriations. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for PHAs to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and better reflect actual voucher usage, resulting in lower appropriations. PHAs were funded based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor, and multiplied by the number of vouchers they could reasonably lease. The law changed the funding system for PHAs in FY2003 to base budgets on utilization rates and costs reported in end-of-year statements, rather than authorized vouchers. HUD implemented this provision to reflect actual voucher usage and reduce unspent funds. HUD implemented a provision in FY2003 to base PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs reported in end-of-year statements. Renewal calculations for voucher funding will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data, adjusted by Annual Adjustment Factors. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three months to reflect recent leasing and cost data. HUD implemented a provision in FY2003 to base PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs reported in end-of-year statements. Renewal calculations for voucher funding will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data, adjusted by Annual Adjustment Factors. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three months to reflect recent leasing and cost data. Congress also established a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs. The law established a Central Reserve fund to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs. Restrictions were placed on maximized leasing, preventing PHAs from supporting more vouchers than authorized. This caused issues for over-leased PHAs, leading them to refrain from reissuing vouchers to meet authorized levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued restrictions on maximized leasing, funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and controlling costs to address concerns about cost increases in the voucher program. The FY2004 appropriations law maintained restrictions on maximized leasing, funded PHAs based on actual voucher utilization, and emphasized cost control to address concerns about rising costs in the voucher program. The conference report highlighted the Secretary's authority to manage costs by renewing expiring annual contributions contracts based on unit months under lease. The FY2004 appropriations law changed the language from FY2003 regarding the renewal of section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies. It also modified how the Central Reserve fund could be used, allowing it to replenish PHA reserves depleted by increased utilization rates or costs. The FY2004 appropriations law modified the language from FY2003 regarding the renewal of section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies. It also changed how the Central Reserve fund could be used, allowing it to replenish PHA reserves depleted by increased utilization rates, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice implementing the FY2004 appropriations law. The FY2004 appropriations law modified the renewal of section 8 contracts for public housing agencies and allowed the Central Fund to replenish PHA reserves. HUD issued a controversial notice implementing the law, basing PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-year statements. PHAs could appeal if rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. The notice allowed PHAs to appeal if rental costs in their areas had exceeded HUD's inflation factor. Despite controversy, HUD granted appeals to 380 out of 400 agencies, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Appropriations Act further directed funding based on voucher costs and utilization rates. The FY2005 Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from specific time periods. If data was unavailable, funding was based on financial statements. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated among agencies. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs accordingly. The FY2005 Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from specific time periods. If data was unavailable, funding was based on financial statements. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated among agencies. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve provided. The act also continued the prohibition on maximized leasing and made changes to how PHAs received their voucher renewal funding. The FY2005 appropriations act made changes to how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided guidance on budget levels in December 2004, requiring PHAs to manage within their budgets with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve. HUD implemented changes to the voucher renewal funding process for PHAs in the FY2005 appropriations act, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. Agencies had to adjust their budgeting process accordingly, with guidance issued in December 2004. PHAs were notified of their preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004, and were given the opportunity to appeal data errors. The final calculations, including a proration factor of just under 96%, were published on January 21, 2005, resulting in agencies being funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004. The final calculations, including a proration factor of just under 96%, were published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded generally at 4.03% less than their May-July 2004 actual cost and utilization levels, plus the 2005 AAF. According to CRS analysis of HUD funding data, the median change in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005 was an increase of 0.17%, with a wide variance in changes ranging from a decrease of 12% to an increase of 14%. HUD also published Notice PIH 2005-9 on February 25, 2005, providing PHAs with options to lower their costs in 2005. On February 25, 2005, HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9, offering PHAs options to reduce costs in 2005, such as lowering payment standards, restricting portability, and monitoring income eligibility more strictly. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act distributed renewal funding based on CY2005 eligibility levels. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act distributed renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility levels, with adjustments for inflation and additional vouchers. The Act also provided $45 million for budget adjustments in specific circumstances. The prohibition on maximized leasing was maintained in FY2006. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act allocated renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility levels, with adjustments for inflation and additional vouchers. $45 million was provided for budget adjustments in specific cases, with PHAs funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Incentives were given to PHAs to reduce costs, which, combined with a cooled rental housing market, helped reverse the cost growth trend seen in 2003. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act allocated funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility levels, with adjustments for inflation and additional vouchers. Incentives were given to PHAs to reduce costs, which, combined with a cooled rental housing market, helped reverse the cost growth trend seen in 2003. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from 2004 to 2005 and declined by about 1.5% from 2005 to September 2006. Utilization also declined, with nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds as they were not spending all of their funding. In September 2006, utilization of funding for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) declined to around 90%, resulting in 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 to September 2006. Nationally, budget utilization dropped to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to continue funding in FY2007. In FY2007, the debate continued between a budget-based and unit-based funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005 and FY2006. The budget also requested lifting the prohibition on maximized leasing to address excess funding issues for some PHAs. In FY2007, some Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) had excess funding they couldn't use due to being at their cap on authorized vouchers. Congress rejected President Bush's proposal and adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months. In FY2007, PHAs received funding based on leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors. The law included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain categories. The act provided adjustments for public housing agencies facing funding decreases due to formula shifts, with exceptions for Hurricane Katrina-affected agencies, those under receivership, and agencies that overspent in the prior year. Under the FY2007 formula change, public housing agencies that would have lost funding were funded based on their higher FY2006 amounts. Agencies that spent more in FY2006 than their allocations were also funded based on FY2006 amounts. PHAs were funded based on their FY2006 usage, with those having higher costs doing better under the new formula. Funding was sufficient to cover all agencies at over 105% of eligibility. The FY2007 formula for public housing agencies provided sufficient funding to cover all agencies at over 105% of their eligibility. It combined elements of unit-based and budget-based funding, with agencies with higher costs and utilization rates doing better under the new formula. The FY2007 formula for public housing agencies was a combination of unit-based and budget-based funding, with funding allocations based on the number of vouchers used and a fixed budget for program administration. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposal also included a \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula, similar to previous years, adjusting funding based on eligibility in the previous year and other associated costs. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for public housing agencies, similar to FY2007. Funding was based on leasing and costs from the prior calendar year, adjusted for the AAF, FSS deposits, tenant protection vouchers, and project-based commitments. The President planned to re-benchmark the formula in the future, possibly in FY2009, as part of a larger reform proposal. The FY2008 Act (P.L. 110-161) implemented a funding formula for public housing agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. It included a central reserve fund for adjustments and an alternative formula for specific categories of agencies. Unlike FY2007, it also included a rescission that reduced funding for agencies with excessive reserves. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced funding for public housing agencies with excessive reserves, specifically targeting unusable reserves above 7% of their funding. This freed up reserves that couldn't be used for leasing, allowing Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing the total amount provided. In FY2008, the Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs with excessive reserves above 7%, freeing up unusable reserves for Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing total funding available. President Bush's request for a budget-based funding formula in FY2009 was rejected, leading to HUD funding PHAs based on a hybrid, cost, and utilization-based formula similar to FY2008. In FY2009, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on the number and cost of vouchers leased in FY2008, adjusted for inflation. PHAs' allocations were prorated based on HUD's estimate of their Net Restricted Assets (NRA), with an aggregate NRA offset of $750 million. PHAs were expected to supplement new funding with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments under certain circumstances. The FY2009 funding for PHAs was based on vouchers leased in FY2008, adjusted for inflation. PHAs were allocated based on their Net Restricted Assets (NRA), with an aggregate offset of $750 million. They were expected to supplement new funding with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments under certain circumstances. HUD's estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA balances for CY2009 were sometimes inaccurate due to inaccurately reported data. HUD allocated CY2009 funding for PHAs based on FY2008 data, but inaccuracies in estimates led to funding shortfalls for some agencies. Approximately 15% of PHAs faced insufficient funding to cover voucher costs. HUD worked with agencies to address these shortfalls, providing additional funding from the FY2009 $100 million renewal set-aside. Some PHAs in CY2009 faced funding shortfalls for vouchers, leading to potential assistance loss for families. HUD provided additional funding from the FY2009 set-aside to address the issue and advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to stay within budgets. Congress enacted legislation to address concerns about families losing assistance. In CY2009, some Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) faced funding shortfalls for vouchers, risking assistance loss for families. HUD allocated additional funding from the FY2009 set-aside to prevent assistance termination. Congress passed legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million to support PHAs at risk of cutting assistance. This policy change increased the set-aside renewal funding to $100 million and expanded its use to prevent assistance termination. The FY2010 budget request under the Obama Administration introduced a different approach to voucher funding. The policy change in FY2009 increased set-aside renewal funding for HUD to prevent assistance termination. The FY2010 budget request by the Obama Administration introduced a new funding formula and allowed for offsetting excess reserves to allocate funding to high-performing agencies or based on need. The budget also lifted the prohibition on over-leasing for PHAs to fully utilize their budgets. The FY2010 budget requested the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing agencies or based on need. The final funding law adopted a similar formula but did not provide the Secretary with the authority to offset budgets or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. The FY2010 budget did not grant the Secretary authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. The FY2010 allocation formula did not include an offset for unspent agency reserves. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization. The FY2011 law (P.L. 112-10) had no offset from PHA reserves, while the FY2012 law (P.L. 112-55) included a $650 million rescission to be offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. PHAs were serving more families than authorized and spending nearly every federal dollar following funding formula changes enacted in FY2003. Following changes in funding formulas between FY2003 and FY2006, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) served fewer families and spent a smaller share of federal funding. Low utilization of funding and vouchers continued after another formula change in FY2007. With a shift to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model, PHAs' utilization patterns have started to improve, with funding utilization increasing from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families by the end of 2009. The voucher funding formula changed in FY2007 to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model. Funding utilization increased from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009, with PHAs serving over 150,000 more families. Reserves accumulated during budget-based formula days were spent down by the end of FY2009 due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. During the budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006, reserves were spent down by the end of FY2009 due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs started rising in CY2007 and were projected to continue increasing in CY2012. Members of Congress have introduced voucher reform legislation with changes to the funding formula, but Appropriations Committees could still override it with a different allocation formula each year since FY2003. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes to address inefficient allocations and rising costs. Prior to FY2003, funding was determined by a formula, limiting Congress's control. Appropriations Committees have overridden new funding formulas each year since FY2003, raising uncertainty about their deference to authorizing committees. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes starting in FY2003, converting the funding structure to a fixed annual sum. This gave Congress more control over the budget but made the program harder to administer for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). PHAs have limited control over costs due to statutorily set subsidies for families. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes in FY2003, converting to a fixed annual sum. This gave Congress more control over the budget but made it harder for PHAs to administer. PHAs have limited control over costs due to statutorily set subsidies for families. PHAs made changes in areas where they had control, such as payment standards and selecting families from the waiting list. Some PHAs lowered payment standards and undertook rent reasonableness reviews, leading to some landlords no longer participating in the program. Some PHAs reduced payment standards to 100% or less of local fair market rents, leading to landlords accepting lower rents or leaving the program. PHAs could choose higher-income families to lower subsidy costs, but still had to target 75% of vouchers to low-income families. Some PHAs intentionally decreased voucher issuance to save money, causing budget issues in the following year. Some agencies intentionally reduced voucher issuance to save money, leading to budget problems the following year. Data from HUD shows that voucher costs and utilization rates decreased from 2005 to 2006, with average costs dropping by 1.5% and utilization declining by over 2%. Additionally, some agencies received more funding than allowed under the budget-based formulas in FY2005 and FY2006. In 2006, average voucher costs decreased by 1.5% and utilization declined by over 2%. Some agencies received more funding than allowed, leading to unusable funds. Changes to the budget-based funding formula in FY2006 were controversial among low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. In FY2006, some PHAs had waiting lists for vouchers due to unusable funds. Low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups criticized the budget-based funding formula changes. Advocates called for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula. The FY2007 funding bill reversed trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula based on previous year's usage. PHAs with large funding surpluses received less funding in FY2007. The FY2007 funding bill enacted a voucher renewal funding formula based on previous year's usage, resulting in PHAs with large funding surpluses receiving less funding. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, including reductions in budgets for agencies with excess reserve funding. Rescissions and offsets made unusable funding usable, reducing the amount of appropriations needed for the program. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in agency budgets for those with excess reserves. Rescissions and offsets made unused funding usable, reducing the appropriations needed. The FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar, without reductions related to reserves. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization. Rising costs and utilization are increasing the program's cost to Congress. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, leading to rising costs and utilization in the program. This could put pressure on policy makers to find ways to contain costs while maintaining service levels to families. Voucher reform legislation has proposed formula changes to maximize the number of families served. Policy makers may need to tailor policies to maintain service levels for families while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform aims to serve more families without capping cost growth, subject to potential override by future appropriations legislation."
