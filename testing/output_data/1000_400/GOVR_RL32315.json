    "content": "Significant amounts of technically recoverable oil and gas resources are projected to be on federal public lands, but energy development on some restricted environmentally sensitive areas may be limited. These areas could still hold substantial oil and gas reserves. The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue. Initiatives are being considered to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on public lands. The omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and Senate substitute, S. 2095, include provisions to address restrictions on oil and gas development on public lands. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the permitting process for oil and gas on federal lands. Debate over oil and gas development practices dates back to the early years of the industry, with concerns about abuse of the Mining Law of 1872 leading to wasteful use of public lands. President Taft withdrew millions of acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California in 1909. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California in 1909, leading to the Pickett Act of 1910 which recognized executive branch authority for public land withdrawals. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system. This created split-estate situations where minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands, leading to the dominance of the mineral estate over surface rights. The federal government can issue patents for land but reserve mineral rights, creating split-estate situations. Mineral estate holders must follow specific procedures for developing minerals, including obtaining consent from surface owners or paying for damages. In Wyoming, 50% of lands have split-estate, while in Montana it's about 57%. Environmentalists support public land withdrawals. Environmentalists and ranchers have expressed concerns about the impact of oil and gas development on water and land. Development supporters argue that existing environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, regulate oil and gas development on public lands. Development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands, including compliance with NEPA, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, and reclamation standards. The industry faces delays due to environmental reviews, but proposed energy bills aim to address concerns over increasing domestic oil and gas supplies. The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill (H.R. 6) and S. 2095 aims to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas development. Title III of the bills would establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to address industry concerns. Environmentalists argue that these provisions could harm the environment. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action after a cloture motion failed to pass. The conference report on the energy bill aims to expedite oil and gas development on public lands, which has been approved by the House but not the Senate. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action. The report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. It also discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas towards meeting U.S. energy demand. The curr_chunk discusses the leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development, based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts of public land with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter, and drilling permits are required for exploratory or production wells. Development on federal public lands for oil and gas is based on Resource Management Plans by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts with potential are leased quarterly, with drilling permits needed for wells. In FY2002, 1,765 new leases were issued totaling 1.4 million acres. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires Land Use Plans before development, considering environmental impacts. In FY2002, 18.6 million acres of public lands were leased for oil and gas development under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Resource Management Plans are required for land use planning, considering diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, and energy. The plans aim to weigh the benefits of public lands for the community and must be consistent with environmental regulations. The Resource Management Plans (RMPs) aim to balance various uses of public lands, including recreation and energy, while considering present and future needs. The plans identify impacts early on to weigh them equitably and determine which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing. The Mineral Leasing Act requires public lands to be offered for lease through competitive bidding to provide a fair market value return to the federal government. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holds quarterly auctions for public lands leases, offering them to the highest bidder to ensure a fair market value return to the federal government. If no bids meet the $2/acre minimum, leases are offered noncompetitively. Noncompetitive leases can be obtained by the first qualified applicant for a fee of at least $75. Leasing on public lands may be obtained by the first qualified applicant with a nonrefundable fee of at least $75. Simultaneous lease applications are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for further exploration and development. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved after obtaining a lease. After obtaining a lease on public lands, the lessee must file a notice of intent with the BLM and comply with specific practices outlined by the surface managing agency. The lessee is granted exclusive rights to explore, develop, and produce on the land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, including a drilling plan, surface use plan, and evidence of bond/surety coverage. The Secretary must analyze and approve a plan of operations for proposed surface-disturbing activities within the lease area. The lessee must submit an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) with a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The APD is reviewed for 30 days, followed by consultation with the surface managing agency. The BLM must process the application within 35 days, and it may be approved, approved with stipulations, rejected, or delayed. Despite the 35-day review requirement, a recent study by a trade association found delays in the process. The Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be processed by the BLM within 35 days and can result in approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay. A study by the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS) found delays in APD approval, with an average of 137 days in 2002 compared to 84 days in 2001. Delays are often due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development. The BLM and IPAMS both require updating outdated RMPs due to increased natural gas leasing and development, which may exceed old plan limits. This revision is necessary before drilling permits can be issued. The process involves public involvement, EIS preparation, and approval by the BLM under FLPMA Section 1712. The BLM and IPAMS are updating outdated RMPs to address new land use concerns, particularly related to coalbed methane development. The process involves public involvement, EIS preparation, and approval by the BLM. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs can now take up to three years, compared to less than one year in the past. The usefulness of an RMP is now estimated to be seven years, down from potentially 20 years in the past. The rewriting of RMPs can now take up to three years, compared to less than one year in the past. The usefulness of an RMP is now estimated to be seven years, down from potentially 20 years in the past. The rapid pace of coalbed methane development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in RMPs. Environmentalists argue that 20-year-old plans are not suitable for current land management decisions, leading to delays in site-specific analysis for drilling permits. The BLM announced new strategies in 2003 to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing geographic area development planning, and establishing standard operating practice agreements. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized into lands open under standard lease terms. The BLM announced new strategies in 2003 to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing geographic area development planning, and establishing standard operating practice agreements. Public lands for oil and gas leasing can be categorized into three categories: lands open under standard lease terms, open to leasing with restrictions, and closed to leasing. Areas closed to leasing consist of wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, and environmentally sensitive areas unlikely to be reopened for oil and gas leasing. Some lands are closed pending land use planning or NEPA compliance, while others are closed due to federal land management decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites. Some lands are closed to leasing due to federal land management decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites. Approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, while another 182 million acres are subject to mineral development. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those that are statutorily withdrawn. Approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, subject to valid existing subsurface mineral rights. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those that are statutorily withdrawn. Another 182 million acres are subject to mineral development, with restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior. Wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas, and roadless areas are examples of lands that may be open to leasing with restrictions. Roadless areas and wildlife refuges are examples of lands withdrawn from leasing, with various restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior. These restrictions include no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans. Industry sources argue that some stipulations act as de facto closures to oil and gas development, hindering exploration and limiting reserve bases. Despite this, development has proceeded under certain stipulations. Energy and mineral industry representatives claim that federal withdrawals inhibit exploration even under favorable production conditions. Some lease stipulations act as de facto closures to oil and gas development, hindering exploration and limiting reserve bases. Despite this, development has proceeded under certain stipulations. The industry argues that federal withdrawals inhibit exploration and limit the reserve base, while environmental groups believe the withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of the natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands in the lower 48 states. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands in the lower 48 states, with 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region on public lands. About 40% of that amount is not accessible or is subject to lease stipulations and restrictions. The region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to increased interest in access to natural gas. The Rocky Mountain region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy. Recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the region, with data from the National Petroleum Council (NPC) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EPCA Report focuses on five major geologic basins within the region. The EIA and NPC studies provide data on total domestic natural gas supplies, with a focus on federal lands and their accessibility for development. The Rocky Mountain region has been a key focus for U.S. oil and gas policy. Data from the EIA and NPC studies show similar amounts of natural gas resources in the region. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in five major geologic basins. The NPC study indicates a natural gas resource base of 335 tcf, while the EIA estimates 293.6 tcf of technically recoverable natural gas resources. The relative amounts of natural gas closed and restricted are similar across the studies. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region. The NPC and EIA studies show differences in the amount of natural gas open to leasing, with 60% and 51.5% respectively. Proven reserves on federal lands account for a significant portion of the difference. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region. Proven reserves on federal lands contribute to the differences in natural gas open to leasing, with 60% and 51.5% shown in Table 1. If Rocky Mountain reserves were included in the EIA report, the percentage of natural gas open for leasing would likely increase. Oil resources in the Rocky Mountains have less significance for U.S. oil supply, with 600 million barrels falling under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing. The EPCA study found that oil resources in the Rocky Mountains have less significance for U.S. oil supply. About 600 million barrels fall under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels are available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. Additionally, 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The relative rate of no access was similar to other reports at 11.6%, while the amount of restricted gas was less at 26%. The EPCA study found that about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States is available on non-federal lands in the Rockies. The NPC and EIA studies suggest that developing natural gas in restricted land areas would likely face costly delays, but with greater flexibility in federal regulations, up to 80 tcf of natural gas could become available for development. The EIA report suggests that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, up to 80 tcf of natural gas could become available for development from restricted land areas in the Rockies. Environmental groups argue that relaxing these restrictions would pose a risk to the environment. The NPC study estimates a total of 335 tcf of natural gas resources in the region, with 41% being closed or restricted. The Rocky Mountain region has substantial oil and gas reserves on public lands, with disagreements on their importance for meeting U.S. energy needs. Approximately 108 tcf of natural gas in the region is currently restricted, which could last 20-30 years if produced at a rate of 4-5 tcf per year, meeting about 15% of projected demand. The United States has 37% of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas resource base onshore lower 48. If the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region were produced, it could last 20-30 years, meeting about 15% of projected demand. The Wilderness Society testified that the US has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, based on annual demand growth. The Wilderness Society testified that the United States has sufficient natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, based on annual demand growth projections. The NPC report estimated that 1,351 tcf of natural gas could be available for development in the future, with 16% subject to restrictions. The NPC report estimates that 16% of the 1,351 tcf of natural gas cited could be subject to restrictions, with 70 tcf in the Rocky Mountains potentially available for production if restrictions are lifted. The NPC suggests resolving impediments to access this gas by relaxing land-use constraints on federal lands in the intermountain west. This includes addressing \"no surface occupancy\" designations and restrictive environmental resource protections. The RAND Corporation proposed relaxing land-use constraints on federal lands in the intermountain west to allow for more drilling. They suggest focusing on the reserve category of the resource base and considering access restrictions only for the most viable resources. This approach would reduce the amount of restricted resources, but the analysis would be complicated by the conversion rate of oil and gas resources to reserves. Total U.S. oil production is forecasted to decline annually, with imports expected to make up a significant portion of supply by 2025. Natural gas production has increased, with federal onshore oil production accounting for a small percentage of total U.S. oil production. Oil production from federal onshore leases in the U.S. has been declining over the past decade, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top three states for onshore federal oil production. Natural gas production in the U.S. has been increasing steadily, with projections showing a potential increase to 24.3 tcf by 2025. Oil imports are expected to make up nearly 65% of total U.S. supply by 2025. U.S. natural gas production has varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections indicating a potential increase to 24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are forecasted to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. LNG imports are projected to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands has increased to 2.2 tcf. U.S. natural gas production has been increasing steadily, with projections indicating a potential rise to 24.3 tcf by 2025. Gas production on public lands has increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002. Proved U.S. oil reserves were reported to be 22.7 billion barrels. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is expected to remain stable at 85% (1.87 tcf). Proved U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with Texas leading in both oil and natural gas reserves. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past decade, while U.S. production decreased by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, significantly higher than the average annual discovery since 1976. The U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, with production decreasing by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, three times higher than the average annual discovery since 1976. Discoveries in 2002 were about 950 million barrels, 6% over the annual average since 1976. The technically recoverable onshore and state offshore oil resources are estimated at 92 billion barrels, but not all may be recoverable. The rate of production is expected to continue declining in the long term. The United States has seen an increase in gas reserves by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual gas discoveries have increased by 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount. Gas reserves have increased by 16.5 tcf (10%) since 1991, with production also rising. U.S. gas imports have increased to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries were up 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount of current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of the total onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is classified as unconventional, with 25% being coalbed methane. The resource assessment in the Rocky Mountain West estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands make up 53.6%, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. Federal onshore oil is estimated to be 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, and natural gas on public lands is estimated at 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, and undiscovered conventional natural gas resources are estimated at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. The EPCA Study from January 2003 provides estimates by the EIA on federal onshore oil and natural gas resources. Federal onshore oil accounts for 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands is estimated at 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet, and unconventional natural gas at 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is dissolved in water and trapped in coalbeds, with extraction requiring the removal of water pressure to allow the gas to flow. Methane gas, a natural gas dissolved in water and trapped in coalbeds, is extracted by removing water pressure through pumping. Operators may fracture coal formations to release gas and water, raising concerns about groundwater contamination. Water quality and disposal methods are central issues in coalbed methane production. Coalbed methane (CBM) production involves extracting methane gas trapped in coalbeds by removing water pressure. Water quality and disposal methods are key concerns in CBM production. A 1980 tax credit incentivized CBM development, leading to significant production growth since 1987. In 2002, CBM accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the US, with 10,000 wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Production rates vary due to coalbed geology, with leading producers in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. In 2002, 18.8 tcf of natural gas was produced in the United States, with 10,000 CBM wells also producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Leading CBM producers are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. DOE estimates 39,000 new wells by 2010, with 23,900 on federal lands. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the US are economically recoverable. Coalbed methane proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, doubling since 1991. The EIA study of U.S. oil and gas resources found that 46 tcf of coalbed methane in the Rocky Mountain region, with 20% falling under \"no access.\" Coalbed methane reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, doubling since 1991. Colorado and New Mexico hold over half of U.S. CBM reserves, while Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, followed by the Warrior Basin in Alabama. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf, with split-estates ownership. The Powder River Basin (PRB) in Wyoming has significant CBM resources estimated at 39 tcf, with split-estates ownership. Over 80% of CBM wells are on privately or state-held land, leading to concerns about surface use agreements and fair compensation for damages. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to address concerns between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees regarding compensation for damages from CBM or other extractive industries. Environmental concerns focus on land and water issues related to CBM production, including infrastructure, water usage, and effects on the water table. Environmental concerns about CBM production primarily focus on land disturbance and water issues, including surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM has raised concerns about the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water, with a draft EPA report stating no evidence of contamination but expressing worry over the use of diesel fuel in the process. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing for CBM due to its potential impact on underground drinking water. An agreement was reached to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation includes provisions to prohibit EPA regulation of fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Dennis Hemmer of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality noted that most water from CBM production does not reach the surface. Proposed energy legislation (H.R. 6 and S. 2095) may prevent EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. CBM production results in water discharges of 602 million barrels annually, with concerns about pollution and water sources. Environmentalists worry about the impact of holding ponds leaking into groundwater. CBM production results in discharges of 602 million barrels annually, typically into surface waters or holding ponds. Environmentalists are concerned about the impact on groundwater from leaking holding ponds. Wildlife habitats may be threatened by the infrastructure required for CBM production. BLM has mandated monitoring wells to address concerns over groundwater quality and quantity. The impact of CBM production on natural vegetation and aquatic life in waterways is a concern, as well as the threat to wildlife habitats from the infrastructure. BLM requires monitoring wells for CBM leases to monitor water quality and levels, with one set per four townships. Private lands are exempt from this requirement. Three leases were invalidated in 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. The Interior Board of Land Appeals invalidated three leases in April 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw additional leases from a June 2002 sale in Wyoming. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw leases from a June 2002 sale in Wyoming, leading to a halt in lease sales on public lands with high CBM content. The IBLA ruling was dismissed in December 2003, and the Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP for approving 39,000 permits for new wells. DOI made a decision to begin issuing permits in July 2003. Oil demand is forecasted to rise annually to 28 mbd by 2025. The Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP, anticipating approving 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. Demand for oil is forecasted to rise 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports projected to reach nearly 65%. U.S. demand for natural gas is expected to rise 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is mixed, with uncertainty on how much will come from currently restricted areas. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions where possible. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on U.S. public lands for natural gas production. Uncertainty remains on the amount of domestic supply that will come from currently restricted areas. Challenges have been reported based on alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use mandate. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, while onshore unconventional natural gas is forecasted to increase its share by 2025. The Bush Administration is taking action to ease restrictions on U.S. public lands for natural gas production. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, while onshore unconventional natural gas is forecasted to increase its share by 2025. The industry is concerned about access to federal lands and expediting the permitting process, while environmental groups worry about potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. The U.S. will likely meet energy demand through a mix of increased domestic output and higher imports, with the Rocky Mountain region potentially accounting for 40% of U.S. natural gas production in 2025. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms are exploring worldwide for the best return on investment, considering factors like political stability and resource base. The U.S. is considered politically stable with an attractive resource endowment, but concerns about environmental impact and residents remain. Oil and gas firms worldwide seek the best return on investment, considering factors like political stability and resource base. The United States is politically stable with an attractive resource endowment, but concerns about environmental impact and public land use decisions must be weighed. Terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases include maximum acreage, bonus bids, term length, bond requirements, rentals, and royalties. The onshore leasing program in the United States generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. The terms for noncompetitive leases include a maximum acreage of 10,240 acres, a 10-year term, and a $10,000 bond requirement. Rentals start at $1.50/acre for 1-5 years and increase to $2/acre thereafter, with a royalty of at least 12.5% on production sold from the lease. The onshore leasing program in the United States generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and other programs. States receive a percentage of revenues collected from public land oil and gas leases within their boundaries, with Alaska receiving a higher percentage. Revenues from federal leases fluctuate due to price changes, with the number of federal oil and gas leases standing at 23,000 in 2001. The National Park System (NPS) was established in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. Yellowstone National Park was the first public lands withdrawal in 1872, with Congress creating other national parks regularly. The NPS philosophy initially differed from the Forest Service's focus on resource use in forest reserves. In the early days of the National Park System (NPS), there was tension with the Forest Service (FS) over differing philosophies on resource use. The focus of the public lands withdrawal debate in the early 1900s was on the President's authority to make withdrawal orders based on national security. The public lands withdrawal debate focused on the President's authority to make withdrawal orders based on national security. Withdrawals changed the designation of specific land parcels from available to unavailable for various activities. Presidents have historically exercised the power to withdraw or reserve lands, such as establishing military reservations. Withdrawals also occurred under various acts, including the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Presidents have historically exercised the power to withdraw or reserve lands for various purposes, such as establishing military reservations. This authority is granted under acts like the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. National monuments can be created through statutory delegation, allowing the President to reserve the smallest area necessary for proper care and management of protected sites on federal lands. The President can reserve the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of protected sites on federal lands under the Antiquities Act. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws. The Organic Act regulated recreation and primitive areas. FLPMA allows withdrawals by the executive branch or Congress. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas from resource use. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. The Wilderness Act requires the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. Wilderness is defined as an area off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Federal lands can only be designated as wilderness areas by Congress or as provided for in the Wilderness Act. Congress has the authority to create National Parks and wilderness areas, while the executive branch can reserve public lands. The Wilderness Act and Acts of Congress govern the withdrawal of public lands. Congress has sole authority to create National Parks and wilderness areas. The executive branch can reserve public lands under delegated power. Congress may withdraw specific resources like oil and minerals. Modern executive withdrawals are regulated by FLPMA, which established a federal land use management policy based on multiple-use planning. The General Mining Law of 1872 allowed for the removal of minerals from public lands. The \"general congressional\" withdrawal permits lands to be excluded from development until a final decision is made. FLPMA governs modern executive withdrawals and emphasizes a multiple-use approach to land management with public and congressional input. Withdrawals under FLPMA can be temporary or permanent, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval for withdrawal lasting up to 20 years. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval for up to 20 years. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years, with a report due three months after the withdrawal. FLPMA also mandates a review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states to determine their necessity and duration. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years under FLPMA. A review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states is mandated to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals. BLM is prioritizing the review of approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, focusing on 26 million acres expected to be returned for various uses. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, with a focus on 26 million acres expected to be returned for various uses. As of November 2000, BLM had completed reviewing 7 million acres, with withdrawals on over 6 million acres revoked. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need, with continuous review process. The review process for land withdrawals by the BLM requires a compelling show of need and approval from agency managers, the BLM Director, and the Secretary. The process is continuous and must be supported by documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act. Some lands may be opened for oil and gas development, while others will likely remain closed or restricted."
