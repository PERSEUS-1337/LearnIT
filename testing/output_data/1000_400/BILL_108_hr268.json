The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, quick progress in impactful areas, and collaborative scientific efforts. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts through collaborative scientific efforts and research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts through collaborative scientific efforts and research grants to universities and research institutions. The program research priorities are outlined in Section 3. The United States Weather Research Program's research priorities include improving hurricane forecasts for landfall location and strength, enhancing forecasts for heavy precipitation events like winter storms and rain storms, improving flood forecasting and warning systems, and enhancing two-to-fourteen day forecasting for high-impact weather events. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving hurricane forecasts, enhancing forecasts for heavy precipitation events, improving flood forecasting systems, and enhancing two-to-fourteen day forecasting for high-impact weather events. This includes hydrologic prediction, forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones, Hemispheric Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORpex), and evaluating advanced data assimilation techniques in global models to identify effective ways of delivering weather information. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on testing and evaluating advanced data assimilation techniques in global models, assessing societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, identifying effective ways of delivering weather information, and researching the connection between weather research and improving human conditions. Additionally, research concepts are tested at United States Weather Research Program-sponsored test bed centers. The United States Weather Research Program tests research concepts at test bed centers to enable technology transfer to operational meteorologists and ensure a connection between weather research and improving human conditions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the United States Weather Research Program and collaborates with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan for research, dissemination of weather information, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is required to report annually to specific congressional committees on the five-year plan for weather research, funding details, changes to the plan, and the assessment of plan objectives. The Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to receive appropriations for fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006, totaling $15,000,000, $15,500,000, and $16,000,000 respectively. At least 50 percent of the funds are designated for competitive grants, contracts, or agreements with higher education institutions. For fiscal year 2006, the Office of Atmospheric Research is authorized to receive $16,000,000, with at least 50 percent allocated for competitive grants, contracts, or agreements with higher education institutions."
