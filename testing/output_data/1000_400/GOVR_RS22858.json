    "content": "This report provides a cumulative history of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy compared with funding for other energy technologies over the past 71 years. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 set funding levels for DOE energy technologies. Figure 1 and Table 1 provide historical funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978, while Table 2 shows relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. The funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978 are presented in Table 1, showing cumulative funding totals for the past 10 years, 41 years, and 71 years. Table 2 converts this data into relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. Figures 2, 3, and 4 display pie charts illustrating the relative shares of cumulative DOE spending for different periods. Energy availability, especially during World War II, and research applications are highlighted. During the post-World War II era, the federal government applied research and development to energy sources for economic growth, focusing on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to manage nuclear weapon development and civilian control of nuclear power. DOE spending for various technologies and energy sources is shown in charts for different time periods. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee nuclear weapon development and civilian control of nuclear power. The Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was formed in 1975 to consolidate various energy programs, leading to the establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977. The Federal Energy Administration was established in 1974, followed by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975, which later led to the creation of the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977. DOE consolidated various energy R&D programs, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency technologies. The federal government primarily focused on fossil energy and nuclear power R&D from FY1948 to FY1977, with significant spending on fossil energy technologies totaling about $17.1 billion in constant FY2016 dollars. Since FY1948, federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies, with spending totaling about $17.1 billion for fossil energy and $51.6 billion for nuclear energy in constant FY2016 dollars. The energy crises of the 1970s prompted the expansion of R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, with DOE becoming the main funder since FY1978. The federal government expanded R&D programs in the 1970s to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. DOE has been the main funder since FY1978, with funding for energy technologies peaking in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 dollars) and dropping to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has gradually increased, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion (2016 dollars)."
