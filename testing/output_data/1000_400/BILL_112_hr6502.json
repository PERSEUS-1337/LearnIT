The Secretary has the authority to designate a combination of drugs as significant if it includes 2 or more drugs that have the potential to advance treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease. The criteria for codevelopment of drug combinations must be met as specified in the FDA's guidance document.

The Codevelopment Task Force is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes an interagency task force to promote the codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations. The task force includes experts in research and drug development for serious diseases like cancer.
