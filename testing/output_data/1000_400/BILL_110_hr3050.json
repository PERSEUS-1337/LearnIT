Each state can appoint a forest fire control officer as the compact administrator to coordinate forest fire prevention and control efforts with other member states. Member states can collaborate to organize and integrate services for the purpose of the compact. Each state can develop and implement a forest fire plan. ARTICLE IV states that if a state's forest fire control agency requests aid from another state's agency to combat forest fires, the requested state can provide assistance while ensuring protection at home. ARTICLE V is not summarized in this text chunk. When member states provide aid to each other under the compact, employees have similar powers, duties, and immunities as those in the receiving state. There is no liability for actions or equipment used during the aid, except as specified in the compact. The compact states that liability for any loss or damage incurred during the aid shall be assumed by the requesting state. The aiding state will be reimbursed for expenses related to equipment, materials, transportation, and employee costs. Each member state shall ensure workers' compensation benefits for employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state under this compact. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state. The compact ensures workers' compensation benefits for all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with member state laws. \"ARTICLE VI outlines procedures for claims and reimbursement of workers' compensation benefits for employees and contract firefighters under the compact.\" The compact does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fire fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities. Each state must maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection as if the compact was not in place. States are still empowered to prevent, control, and extinguish forest fires and enact laws for fire prevention. The compact does not limit states' powers to prevent, control, and extinguish forest fires or enact laws for fire prevention. It also does not impact existing or future relationships between the United States Forest Service and member states. ``ARTICLE VII\n\nRepresentatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators.\n\n``ARTICLE VIII\n\nProvisions of this compact regarding reciprocal aid in combating forest fires apply between states party to this compact and those in other regional compacts if the other state's Legislature agrees to mutual aid provisions.\n\n``ARTICLE IX\" \"ARTICLE IX states that the compact remains in force until a state takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period required.\""
