These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care, as federal law requires states to have a plan for overseeing prescription drug use in this population. The efficacy of psychotropics in children is limited, and Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate their use in foster care. Federal law requires states to oversee prescription drug use in this population. The report discusses congressional oversight, efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assist states, and state monitoring of psychotropic medication use for foster children. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides assistance to states in ensuring appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Child welfare agencies intervene in cases of abuse or neglect, placing children in foster care when necessary. Placement in foster care indicates a judge's decision that the child's home is not safe, giving the state responsibility for the child's care. Foster care is a temporary placement for children removed from unsafe homes due to neglect or abuse. It is intended for reunification with parents or permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or a legal guardian. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children while working towards finding them permanent homes. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system. Nearly 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year, showing a decline in the national foster care caseload over the past decade. States focus on the safety and well-being of children in foster care, aiming for reunification with parents or permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or a legal guardian. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, impacting their brain development and socialization. This can lead to difficulty regulating emotions, interpreting cues, and result in problem behaviors like violence or aggression. Children in foster care may experience altered brain development due to stress from abuse or neglect, leading to difficulties in regulating emotions and interpreting social cues. This can result in problem behaviors such as violence or aggression. A national survey found that a significant percentage of children in foster care are at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, with higher rates in group homes or institutions compared to the general population. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or institutions, have a higher risk of behavioral or emotional problems compared to the general population. Rates of such issues among these children range from 61% to 70%, much higher than the 7% to 11% found in all children of similar age groups. Medicaid-eligible foster care children are increasingly diagnosed with mental health conditions like attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or institutions, have a higher risk of behavioral or emotional problems compared to the general population. Rates of such issues among these children range from 61% to 70%, much higher than the 7% to 11% found in all children of similar age groups. Nearly all children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid-funded health care services, with a significant increase in mental health diagnoses from 2002 to 2007. Older children were more likely to be diagnosed with conditions such as conduct disorders and attention disorders. The prevalence of mental health disorders among children in foster care increased from 2002 to 2007, with older children more likely to be diagnosed. The most common diagnoses varied by age group, with conduct disorders and attention disorders being prevalent. Rates of major mental health diagnoses by age group are shown in Figure 1, indicating an overall increase in diagnoses except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia. Figure 1 displays rates of major mental health diagnoses among children in foster care based on Medicaid eligibility in 2002 and 2007. Rates increased for most diagnoses across age groups, except for depression in children aged 6 to 11 and schizophrenia. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for children in foster care, with coordinated services available through Medicaid. Subsequent comprehensive mental health assessment by a professional within a month of placement in care, with coordinated delivery of services to meet ongoing mental health needs, available through Medicaid. States design their own plans for medical assistance under Medicaid, including primary, acute, and long-term care services. Children in foster care are generally eligible for Medicaid and entitled to the same services as other children in the state's Medicaid program. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid and entitled to the same services as other children in the state's Medicaid program, including comprehensive health screenings and services through the EPSDT program. The EPSDT program under Medicaid covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services for children. States must provide treatment for children's identified health needs, including mental health, using Medicaid financing. Services may include case management, psychiatric care, counseling, and prescription drugs for children with mental health challenges. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management. Evidence shows that interventions such as behavioral therapy, family-focused treatment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy are moderately effective for children with disruptive behaviors. Activities like anger management and social skills training are part of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Medical professionals may also prescribe psychotropics without accompanying psychosocial therapies. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. However, psychotropics may still be prescribed without accompanying psychosocial therapies due to a lack of resources and support. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted that over-reliance on medication for children in care may indicate a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care. There is a need for more evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children in care. \"An over-reliance on medication for children in care may stem from a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care and fewer evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children compared to adults. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports than those who remain at home following an investigation of abuse or neglect.\" Children entering foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports than those who remain at home following an investigation of abuse or neglect. Research shows an increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children compared to non-foster children in Medicaid. However, studies have also found that children in foster care who need mental health services do not always receive them. Between 2009 and 2011, children in foster care had higher rates of Medicaid coverage compared to non-foster children. Studies show that many foster children with mental health needs do not receive necessary services, with some only receiving psychotropic medication without counseling or other treatments. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in out-of-home care vary based on factors such as age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may be using psychotropic medication on any given day, with rates varying based on factors such as age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency. Children in foster care have significantly higher rates of psychotropic medication use compared to children generally. Medicaid-eligible foster children receive psychotropic medication at a much higher rate than other children served by Medicaid, similar to older children with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Children in foster care receive psychotropic medication at a higher rate compared to other children served by Medicaid, similar to older children with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in the child welfare system vary by state and over time. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Research from the early 2000s found great variation in prescription of psychotropic medication for these children. State practices play a significant role in prescribing psychotropic medication, as shown by differences across states. Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 also revealed variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. It found an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications, with 45 states experiencing a relative increase, two states experiencing a relative decrease, and one state experiencing no change over the period. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 found an increase in antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care across 45 states. In 2007, the annual rate of antipsychotic use ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. Subsequent analysis from 2005 to 2010 showed a slight decrease in antipsychotic use among foster care children. Non-foster care children with Medicaid or private insurance had lower levels of antipsychotic use compared to foster care children. The analysis revealed an increase in antipsychotic use among children from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children with Medicaid or private insurance had lower levels of antipsychotic use. Privately insured children saw an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2009, remaining steady through 2013. Data primarily from NSCAW II was used to discuss psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. NSCAW II funded by HHS examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The survey included children who stayed in their homes or were placed in foster care. Initial survey results were collected 4 to 6 months after the investigation. The NSCAW II survey funded by HHS looked at psychotropic medication use in children in foster care, including those living with their own parents or in foster care placements. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up points. They may have entered and re-entered care during the 18- or 36-month period. Children in the NSCAW II study, aged 34 months to 20 years old, may have entered and re-entered foster care. Those living with their own parents were less likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care. Living in congregate care and being school age increased the likelihood of medication use. There was no significant difference in medication use between children placed in foster care and those who remained at home after an investigation. At 18 months following the investigation, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications than those who remained in their homes. By the 36-month follow-up, about one out of three children in care was taking psychotropics, compared to children who remained in their homes. Psychotropic medication use was significantly greater for children in foster group homes or residential treatment programs than those in foster family homes. At 18 months following the investigation, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications than those who remained in their homes. About one out of three children in care was taking psychotropics, with higher prevalence in foster group homes or residential treatment programs. Children in group foster care settings had a higher rate of psychotropic medication use compared to other placement settings. At 18 months after the initial investigation of child abuse or neglect, children in foster care settings had higher rates of psychotropic medication use compared to those who remained in their own homes. Children in group settings had the highest rate of medication use (67.4%), followed by other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), children in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%). This pattern persisted 36 months after the investigation, with over half of children in group settings still taking psychotropics (52%). Children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use, with about half of them taking two or more drugs. This rate was significantly higher compared to children in other placement settings. At 36 months after the initial investigation, children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use, with about 4 out of 10 children in group settings taking two or more drugs. Children in group settings were also more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. At 36 months after the initial investigation, children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use, with about 4 out of 10 children in group settings taking two or more drugs. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropics, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. Older youth, ages 18 and older, were less likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to children ages 6 through 17. The research found that youth ages 11 to 17 had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. Older youth, ages 18 and older, were less likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to children ages 6 through 17. Polypharmacy, defined as the concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 30 days, was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually among all children in foster care. The analysis from 2002 to 2007 showed that polypharmacy, defined as using three or more psychotropic medication classes concurrently for at least 30 days, was consistent at 5.2% to 5.9% annually among children in foster care. In 2011, Medicaid claims data for 20 states indicated similar rates of polypharmacy with antipsychotic drugs for children in foster care (2.8%) and non-foster care (3.1%). Children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child per day. Figure 3 illustrates the percentage of children prescribed different numbers of psychotropic medications. The NSCAW II study found that children in foster care were prescribed an average of 1.9 psychotropic medications per day. Concerns have been raised about the use of multiple antipsychotic medications, as it can lead to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Overprescribing, especially in dosages exceeding recommendations, is a particular concern for foster children. Antipsychotic polypharmacy in foster children has shown greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Concerns include prescriptions exceeding recommendations and very young children being prescribed psychotropics. Studies on safety and efficacy of these medications for children are limited. Studies found that 2.2% of children under 6 in out-of-home care were prescribed psychotropics. Government data from 2008 showed 0.3% to 2.1% of children under 1 were prescribed psychotropic drugs in five states. Health experts have raised concerns about the use of psychotropic drugs in infants and young children in foster care, as studies show increased prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with age. The Government Accountability Office found that 0.3% to 2.1% of children under age 1 in foster care were prescribed psychotropics, compared to a lower rate for infants not in foster care. There are no established mental health indications for the use of these drugs in infants, and their use can lead to serious health effects. Children in foster care, especially those ages 3 to 6, may receive psychotropic medications due to limited mental health services available. However, experts caution against the use of these drugs in infants and young children as they can have serious health effects. Children in foster care may receive psychotropic medications due to limited mental health services available, particularly for those with complex trauma. The use of antipsychotics, prescribed off-label for bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, has increased among children in foster care, with a slight decrease in recent years. The use of antipsychotic medication among children in foster care has steadily increased, with a slight decrease in recent years. This trend may be influenced by limited research on efficacy, pharmaceutical marketing, and a rise in psychotropic prescriptions for children overall. Policymakers and stakeholders are scrutinizing the use of psychotropics in children in foster care, despite limited evidence on their safety. The use of psychotropic medications in children in foster care has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders in the child welfare field. Research on the safety and effectiveness of these medications, particularly antipsychotics, is limited. Studies have shown insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs for various mental health disorders in children, including disruptive behavior disorders and eating disorders. The short duration of most studies hinders the evaluation of long-term effects. The analysis found limited evidence supporting the use of psychotropic medications for child mental health disorders, with concerns about bias in studies and harmful health outcomes associated with antipsychotics. Despite these issues, some children in foster care may benefit from these medications. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma. Stimulants for ADHD are well-researched and effective at reducing core symptoms. Stimulants for ADHD are well-researched and effective at reducing core symptoms. Children in foster care may require higher levels of psychotropic medication due to increased prevalence and severity of mental health conditions. Multiple foster care placements and inconsistent state oversight practices may contribute to this. Children in foster care may require higher levels of psychotropic medication due to increased prevalence and severity of mental health conditions. Multiple foster care placements and inconsistent state oversight practices may contribute to this. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medications used by these children, particularly in clinical drug trials. In 2005, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing to examine the enrollment of children in foster care in clinical drug trials. Congress required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for children in foster care's health and treatment. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care was discussed at a 2007 congressional hearing on health care oversight for these children. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care was discussed at congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan for the health and well-being of children in foster care. In 2008, Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan for the health and well-being of children in foster care, including access to health care and mental health services. This included oversight of drugs prescribed to children in foster care. In 2011, further amendments stipulated protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. In October 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act (P.L. 112-34) amended provisions for a coordinated strategy including protocols for psychotropic medication use in foster care. Senate oversight in December 2011 focused on a study by the Government Accountability Office comparing state policies on prescribing psychotropics for vulnerable child populations. The study compared state policies on prescribing psychotropic medications for foster children and vulnerable child populations against best practice guidelines by AACAP. GAO found that all six state programs lacked comprehensive oversight, with only Texas fully implementing consent procedures. This lack of implementation may lead to caregivers not fully understanding the risks and benefits of using psychotropic medications. According to the report, only Texas fully implemented consent procedures for prescribing psychotropic medications to foster children. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance for monitoring these medications, which was implemented. Witnesses discussed increasing cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use in foster care. Witnesses at a hearing discussed the need for increased guidance from HHS on best practices for overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications. The Senate Finance Committee also held a roundtable to address issues related to prescribing psychotropic medications for children in foster care and to explore alternative strategies for trauma response. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee convened a roundtable discussion with child welfare stakeholders to address issues related to psychotropic medication use in foster care. Former foster youth shared their experiences, noting that therapy helped them transition from medication. The importance of an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional in mental health treatment was highlighted. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses discussed the prevalence of medication use, the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives, tools for determining medication necessity, and the involvement of schools, mental health system, and foster parents in decision-making. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau, GAO, a researcher focusing on medication use among children in care, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO's remarks focused on their work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication prescription among children in care. GAO focused on the agency's work from 2011 to 2014 regarding psychotropic medication prescription among children in foster care. They examined prescribing rates in five states and found varying quality in documentation supporting the use of psychotropics. Experts found that documentation was partially supported for dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidelines. The GAO examined documentation supporting the use of psychotropics in pediatric exams, finding partial support for dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. They recommended HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication by third-party managed care organizations administering Medicaid benefits for children in foster care. However, the guidance did not address the role of MCOs in oversight of psychotropic use among foster children. The GAO found that HHS guidance on oversight of psychotropic medication use among foster children did not address the role of third-party MCOs. State agencies developed practices to support mental health diagnoses and treatment for children in foster care, including guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services. State agencies in seven states developed guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services for children in foster care. Strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, along with state outreach to stakeholders, was critical for implementing oversight practices. GAO did not assess the effectiveness of these state practices or compliance with policies. State agencies in seven states collaborated with child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies to develop guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services for children in foster care. The partnership with stakeholders and gradual rollout of new practices were crucial for implementing oversight work. GAO did not evaluate the effectiveness of state practices or compliance with policies. State officials use various measures to assess their efforts, including monitoring physician prescribing practices and child outcomes. HHS has not organized meetings with stakeholders involved in state oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in care since 2014. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that Health and Human Services (HHS) consider cost-effective ways to convene state stakeholders to collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight for children in care. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use and various federal agencies have worked together to better understand this issue, especially among children in foster care. Interagency cooperation efforts have been made to publicize best practices. The federal government requires states to have protocols for monitoring psychotropic medication use, with federal agencies collaborating to understand the issue, especially among children in foster care. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets, including for FY2017. States under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. This plan must be developed collaboratively with Medicaid agencies and health care experts, outlining a schedule for health screenings. The coordinated strategy for oversight of psychotropic medications in foster care must be developed collaboratively with Medicaid agencies and health care experts. It should include a schedule for initial and follow-up health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, updating and sharing of medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, and oversight of prescription medicines. The oversight of psychotropic medications in foster care includes developing a strategy with Medicaid agencies and health care experts. It involves initial and follow-up health screenings, updating medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, and monitoring prescription medicines. Additionally, federal child welfare law mandates a written plan for each child in foster care, including steps for transition planning for children aging out of foster care. The federal child welfare law requires a written plan for each child in foster care, including health-related records like immunizations, medication, and provider information. These records must be reviewed, updated, and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement, and to the youth upon leaving care. States report their oversight policies to HHS. The federal child welfare law mandates that health records, including information on psychotropic medications, must be reviewed, updated, and shared with foster care parents or providers at each placement. States report their oversight policies to HHS annually. Jurisdictions seeking federal funds for child welfare programs must submit information on psychotropic oversight, as mandated by the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act. State oversight protocols must address screening, consent to treatment, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. The most recent five-year CFSP covers FY2015-FY2019 and includes reporting on the oversight of prescription medicines. The most recent five-year CFSP for FY2015-FY2019 includes reporting on oversight of prescription medicines, specifically protocols for appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. In 2011, HHS convened a working group to address research on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, aiming to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, and research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care. The working group led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, and research on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. It includes representatives from other HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA, which administer Medicaid and provide services for children with complex trauma needs. The working group led by ACF, CMS, and SAMHSA aims to support effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care through Medicaid and block grant funding. In November 2011, a letter was released addressing actions taken by federal agencies to address trauma in children and provide evidence-based treatment. In November 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter addressing the collaboration needed between state agencies to improve medication use for children in foster care. The letter emphasized the importance of State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities working together to ensure continuous access to quality mental health services for these children. Additionally, the agencies discussed raising awareness about psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities must collaborate to improve health, including medication use and prescription monitoring structures. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. Webinars presented data, research, and practices for monitoring medication use, followed by question and answer sessions for state child welfare and mental health stakeholders. In early 2012, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS conducted webinars and Q&A sessions for stakeholders on monitoring psychotropic medication use in foster care. A summit in August 2012 brought together state directors to address medication use and mental health needs of traumatized children. The summit aimed to enhance collaboration on oversight of medication use. The \"Because Minds Matter\" summit in August 2012 aimed to address the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and the mental health needs of traumatized children. State leaders were asked to collaborate on improving oversight, outlining activities, challenges, partners, and a timeline for implementation. Presentations from HHS staff, researchers, and state teams were given on psychotropic oversight. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS took steps to further their work on oversight of psychotropic medications after the summit. The \"Because Minds Matter\" summit in August 2012 focused on psychotropic medication oversight for children in foster care. HHS staff, researchers, and state teams presented on this topic. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS have since taken steps to enhance oversight, including providing guidance to state agencies on monitoring psychotropic medication use. This guidance emphasizes coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. States are required to report on the implementation of these elements. The ACF issued guidance to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development and social-emotional impacts. Additionally, ACF published guides to help youth in foster care ask questions about medications during physician visits. The ACF provided guidance on improving social-emotional outcomes for children who have experienced abuse and neglect, focusing on brain development and its impact. They also published guides to assist youth in foster care with asking questions about medications during physician visits. Additionally, ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs. The ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs, partnering with various entities like universities and a children's hospital. SAMHSA provided funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth, as well as funding a medical director position at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work. SAMHSA funds a medical director position at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work to oversee psychotropic medication monitoring for children and youth. The network disseminates best practices through webinars and a community listerv. CMS issued an informational bulletin in 2012 to address the use of psychotropic medication in vulnerable populations, including children in foster care. The CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services issued an informational bulletin in 2012 to address the oversight of psychotropic medication use for vulnerable populations, including children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place to monitor drug prescribing for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples of oversight methods such as automated system \"edit checks\" and multidisciplinary teams. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children receiving Medicaid. A new measure was added to core measures for states to voluntarily use in improving healthcare delivery to children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued joint guidance on oversight of psychotropic medication use for vulnerable populations, including children in foster care. The new measure added to core measures for states aims to improve healthcare delivery to children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Joint guidance was issued by CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA in 2013 to emphasize the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma.\" This includes children in foster care who may be more likely to receive psychotropic medication. The guidance emphasized the need for psychosocial interventions for children who have experienced complex trauma, such as those in foster care who may be at higher risk of receiving improper psychotropic medication due to the complexity of their symptoms. It promoted the use of functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome measurement to ensure proper treatment services. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. The FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative to reduce psychotropic medication use for foster care children and improve their well-being through incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. This includes $500 million in incentive funding over five years for improved care coordination and evidence-based interventions, as well as $250 million in grant funding for state capacity building. The welfare agency is offering competitive grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program to build state capacity for implementing alternative psychosocial interventions. Activities include child welfare funding for evidence-based interventions for children in care, evaluating the work, and overseeing the use of psychotropic medication. Researchers have focused on states' roles in obtaining consent and monitoring procedures for psychotropics in foster care. Researchers have conducted surveys of states to learn about their policies related to the oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2010, collecting information from 48 states and the District of Columbia. The surveys addressed challenges and solutions identified by states in overseeing the use of psychotropic medication. In 2009 and 2010, researchers surveyed states to assess policies on psychotropic medication use in foster care. Over half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. 26 states had a policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had none. More than half of states used a \"red flag\" marker to identify problems. Researchers surveyed states to assess policies on psychotropic medication use in foster care. 13% rated it of low concern, 26 states had a policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had none. More than half of states used a \"red flag\" marker to identify problems with the safety and quality of psychotropic drug use. Researchers reviewed state policies on psychotropic medication use in foster care, highlighting concerns such as the use of multiple medications simultaneously and exceeding recommended dosages. They found a lack of systematic implementation and study of approaches to improve outcomes for children in care. A 2014 study revealed that many reported policies were missing or underdeveloped, raising further concerns about oversight of psychotropic drug use. States have made efforts to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with some implementing working groups and collaborative initiatives. However, a 2014 study found that existing policies were underdeveloped and lacked key criteria for protecting children, such as appropriate medication use for young children and monitoring of dosage levels. States have taken steps to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with some implementing working groups and collaborative initiatives. For example, the Center for Health Care Strategies worked with six states from 2012 to 2015 to improve oversight by defining common terms, measures, and best practices in monitoring psychotropic medication use among foster youth. The collaborative effort involved representatives from state child welfare, mental health, and Medicaid agencies to define common terms and measures for monitoring psychotropic medication use among foster youth. They developed best practices for oversight and monitoring, with each state setting individual goals and implementing protocols in key areas. The Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from SAMSHA, is providing technical assistance to states on psychotropic medication oversight. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II examined psychotropic medication use among children in families investigated for abuse or neglect. Data was collected in 2008-2009, with follow-up surveys conducted later. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II collected data in 2008-2009 on psychotropic medication use among children in families investigated for abuse or neglect. Follow-up surveys at 18 and 36 months after the initial investigation tracked medication use among these children, including those in foster care settings. Table A-1 displays psychotropic medication use by age and foster care status at initial survey, 18 months, and 36 months. Foster care includes non-relative foster homes, kin placements, and group settings. \"In home\" category includes biological/adoptive parents and informal kinship care. Initial survey did not show statistically significant differences in medication use between foster care and non-foster care children. The initial survey did not show statistically significant differences in medication use between foster care and non-foster care children. However, at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications. For children ages 6 to 10, there was a statistically significant percentage difference between those in foster care and those at home at the 18-month follow-up, but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. For children ages 11 to 17, there was no significant difference at the initial survey, but significant differences were found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up."
