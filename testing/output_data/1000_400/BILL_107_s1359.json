    "content": "The Act titled \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" aims to improve access to fast transmissions for networks, e-commerce, and telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to accelerate the deployment of services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on carriers serving less populated regions will accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives for the benefit of consumers. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives to benefit consumers in less densely populated regions of the Nation. This Act aims to promote the development of competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers in all regions. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide. It reduces regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources to increase investment in initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers to promote competition and investment in telecommunications services. Regulatory relief is granted to \"two percent carriers\" under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, reducing regulatory requirements for these carriers. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced against two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. This does not apply if the rules adopted do not pertain to two percent carriers. The Commission will not enforce the rule against two percent carriers unless a separate evaluation is conducted. This does not apply if the rules adopted do not pertain to two percent carriers. Size-based differentiation among carriers is allowed by law. The Commission limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224. However, the Commission retains authority to access information under specific sections. Integrated operation of two percent carriers is addressed in Section 283. The Commission exempts two percent carriers from maintaining separate affiliates or operations for various services. Additionally, they are not required to participate in tariff pools or adhere to price cap regulation as outlined in Section 284. The Commission allows two percent carriers to opt in or out of participating in common line tariffs administered by NECA without obligation for other study areas. They must give 60 days notice and their election is binding for one year. Carriers can also choose to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for some study areas. \"A two percent carrier may elect to be regulated by the Commission under price cap rate regulation for one or more study areas. The election is binding for one year from the date of the election.\" The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for the rate structure. This includes services not previously offered that expand options for ratepayers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under certain conditions. (a) Pricing Flexibility allows two percent carriers to adjust interstate rates quickly upon certification of competition, streamlining the pricing regulation process. The two percent carrier can adjust interstate rates based on competition certification, streamlining pricing regulation. The Commission will regulate the carrier as non-dominant if engaged in facilities-based entry, exempting them from tariffing interstate service offerings. The two percent carrier, if engaged in facilities-based entry, can adjust interstate rates based on competition certification and is regulated as non-dominant, exempting them from tariffing interstate service offerings. They can participate in the common line tariff by including their study areas in it. Facilities-based entry refers to providing local telephone exchange switching and service to at least one unaffiliated customer within a two percent carrier's service area. A contract-based tariff is a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and its customers, including contract terms, service descriptions, and volume commitments. A contract-based tariff for a two percent carrier includes contract terms, service descriptions, volume commitments, pricing, discounts, and regulations. The term 'service area' is defined as in section 214(e)(5). The text discusses savings provisions related to the authority of the Commission, rights of rural telephone companies, and state authority. Additionally, there is a limitation on merger review. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline for the Commission to make public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must act within 60 days of receiving an application for such mergers. The Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to rule on merger applications involving two percent carriers within 60 days. If no action is taken within the specified period, the application is deemed approved without conditions. The Commission also allows carriers to make elections regarding local exchange facilities acquired through mergers or acquisitions. The Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 mandates the Commission to decide on merger applications involving two percent carriers within 60 days. If no action is taken within this timeframe, the application is automatically approved without conditions. Carriers are also allowed to make elections regarding local exchange facilities acquired through mergers or acquisitions. The provisions of this section apply to applications submitted to the Commission on or after the enactment date of this Act. Applications pending with the Commission at the enactment date are subject to these requirements as if they were filed on that date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being deemed granted. The Commission must act on petitions within 90 days, or relief will be granted. Failure to act results in a stay of enforcement until a decision is made. Any order issued is final and can be appealed. The provisions of this section apply to petitions for reconsideration or waiver submitted to the Commission after the enactment of the Act. Pending petitions will be subject to these requirements as if filed on the enactment date. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS.\n\nExecutive Branch agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and the FBI can request an extension beyond the 60-day or 90-day time limits for petitions or applications under sections 310 or 405 of the Communications Act if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are involved."
