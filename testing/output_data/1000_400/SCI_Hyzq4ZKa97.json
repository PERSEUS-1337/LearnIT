    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. NetScore aims to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. This metric is part of a comparative analysis that includes the top-1 accuracy metric and the information density metric. NetScore is a new metric that evaluates the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of deep neural networks. It was compared with top-1 accuracy and information density metrics across 60 different networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The results serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field amidst growing interest in deep learning. The study presents results on various metrics for a diverse set of networks, serving as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. There is a growing interest in deep learning, with a focus on designing deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity. One key challenge is assessing how well a network strikes this balance, with the information density metric being a widely cited measure. In the study, the focus is on designing deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity. One challenge is assessing this balance, with the information density metric being a widely cited measure. There is a need for universal performance metrics that consider accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity to improve network model search and design. NetScore is a new metric introduced in this study to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture. The study evaluates deep convolutional neural networks like AlexNet BID22, aiming to provide a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The study evaluates deep convolutional neural networks like AlexNet BID22, setting \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5. The results can guide practitioners in the field."
