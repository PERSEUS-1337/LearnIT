    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but the machine learning literature lacks tools for this. A procedure is described to measure compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with a model that composes inferred representational primitives. This procedure helps characterize compositional structure in various settings. The procedure evaluates compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with a model that composes inferred representational primitives. It characterizes compositional structure in various settings, exploring the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The learned speaker model encodes an observation as a character sequence for a downstream task, aiming to measure the reflection of known compositional structure in the learned codes. Understanding the structure of learned representations, including compositionality, is essential in representation learning techniques. The capacity to represent complex concepts by combining simple parts is a key aspect of machine learning approaches. The question of compositionality in learning problems where structure is not pre-built is explored, such as in a hypothetical character-based encoding scheme for communication tasks. Research aims to understand if encoding schemes are compositional and how messages are built from smaller pieces. The current work aims to provide a formal and quantitative technique for evaluating the compositional structure in learned representations. Existing solutions for analyzing compositional structure in agents' messages are subjective and difficult to compare. The focus is on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known, aiming to address the need for a standardized approach in evaluating claims about compositional structure. The current work introduces a formal framework, including the TRE evaluation metric, to assess how well learned representations reflect the compositional structure of model inputs in an oracle setting. The paper introduces a formal framework with the TRE evaluation metric to measure how well representations reflect the compositional structure of model inputs. It optimizes over primitive meaning representations to find a compositional model that approximates the true model.

It discusses searching for attribute vectors and value vectors to produce object representations, and presents experiments on the relationship between compositionality and learning. The paper introduces a formal framework with the TRE evaluation metric to measure how well representations reflect the compositional structure of model inputs. It discusses the evolution of compositionality in relation to other model properties during the learning process, tracks human judgments about compositionality, analyzes the constraints on distances between representations, and explores the necessity of compositional representations for generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. The conclusion includes a discussion on possible applications and generalizations of TRE-based analysis. The discussion concludes with possible applications and generalizations of TRE-based analysis, focusing on the emergence of compositionality in models without explicit composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy offer insights into determining the presence of compositional structure. The experimental question is when and how compositionality arises in models without explicit composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy offer evaluations of compositionality, specialized in linguistic representations. Techniques from this literature are not easily applicable to general settings with non-string-valued representation spaces. There is a lack of existing work describing a suitable procedure for analyzing compositionality in the general case. Machine learning research has responded to the challenge of analyzing compositionality in general settings with non-string-valued representation spaces by proposing alternative evaluation methods. These methods aim to provide a standard and scalable approach compared to manual analyses or task-specific evaluations. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model- and task-specific evaluations for measuring compositionality in natural language processing. This approach examines how surrogate measures track stricter notions of compositionality, including similarity and generalization to structurally novel inputs.

It is complementary to existing work on compositional representation learning, which focuses on learning composition functions for modeling purposes. In NLP, compositionality is measured by examining how surrogate measures track similarity and generalization to novel inputs. This approach focuses on learning composition functions for modeling purposes, such as in a communication task where speaker and listener models use messages to identify referents from a collection of distractors. The goal is to determine if the representations of input objects are compositional, based on the structure of the inputs themselves. The section proposes an automated procedure to determine if representations of input objects are compositional based on the structure of the inputs themselves. It defines a representation learning problem with a dataset of observations, a space of representations, and a model mapping observations to representations. The technique assumes prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs. The technique proposed assumes prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs, where representations computed by the model f are compositional if determined by the structure of D(x). The model f is compositional if each f(x) is determined by the structure of D(x). Compositionality is defined by a composition operation \u03b8 a * \u03b8 b \u2192 \u03b8 in the space of representations. In linguistic contexts, inputs x are natural language strings, derivations D(x) are syntax trees, and representations \u03b8 are logical representations of meaning. To show that a language fragment is compositional, a lexicon D0 mapping words to meaning representations and a grammar for composing meanings are needed. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of identifying lexicon entries and dealing with languages that do not have a clearly-defined syntax in the context of syntactic composition and semantic parsing.

The curr_chunk discusses the compositional nature of speaker models in deriving representations for primitives like dark, blue, green, square, and triangle. It highlights the challenges in reproducing model predictions exactly but shows that approximate reproductions can measure the compositionality of the true predictor. The curr_chunk discusses measuring the compositionality of true predictors by approximating them with compositional models. It introduces the Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluation procedure for finding representations that allow for close approximation of the true function f. The curr_chunk introduces the Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluation procedure for measuring the compositionality of true predictors by approximating them with compositional models. It defines parameters \u03b7 i to optimize representations from parts and evaluates how well the compositional prediction matches the true model prediction. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluates the constructability of representations by optimizing over parts to match true model predictions. The choice of composition function is left to the evaluator, with caution needed to avoid trivial solutions. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluates representations by optimizing parts to match model predictions. Care is needed in choosing the composition function to avoid trivial solutions. Experiments in the paper feature * in fixed and learned forms. Models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and * make TRE(X) differentiable, solvable using gradient descent.

Implementation details for solving Equation 2 using gradient descent are provided, along with strategies for discrete \u0398. Task-specific optimizers can be applied to Equation 2 for other problems. The paper discusses using task-specific optimizers for various problems, including machine translation alignment models. It also explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, focusing on the information bottleneck theory proposed by BID45. This theory suggests that learning in deep models involves an error minimization phase followed by a compression phase, leading to a decrease in mutual information between inputs and their representations. The compression phase aims to find a compositional representation of the input distribution. The framework proposed by BID45 suggests that learning in deep models involves an error minimization phase followed by a compression phase, where mutual information between inputs and their representations decreases. The compression phase aims to find a compositional representation of the input distribution, isolating decision-relevant attributes and discarding irrelevant information. The model predicts classifiers in a meta-learning framework by analyzing example images and labels. The model analyzes images to determine if they match a specific visual concept. It uses a classifier to minimize logistic loss and evaluates using cosine similarity. The training dataset includes 9000 image triplets for positive and negative examples. The model analyzes images using a classifier to determine visual concepts. Attributes like background color and digit identity are considered. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets with a validation set of 500 examples. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average. The relationship between information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to mutual information I(\u03b8; x) during training. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) during training. Both quantities are computed on the validation set, with small TRE indicating a high degree of compositionality. The mutual information and reconstruction error initially start low and increase over training, decreasing together after mutual information reaches a maximum. The small TRE indicates high compositionality. Mutual information and reconstruction error start low, increase during training, and decrease together after mutual information peaks. Results suggest compression in the information bottleneck framework leads to discovering compositional representations. Next, exploring conventional representation learning tasks like high-dimensional embeddings for natural language processing applications. The framework is linked to discovering compositional representations. The focus is on the compositional nature of individual phrase representations, with low reconstruction error indicating compositional meaning. This task is well-studied in natural language processing, with the use of TRE to search for atomic representations. The analysis presented focuses on discovering compositional representations in natural language processing. The goal is to validate the approach in a language processing context and show how existing work on compositionality fits into the proposed framework.

BID7 introduce a notion of topographic similarity to analyze representations with help from oracle derivations. The study explores the compositionality of phrase embeddings versus word embeddings using vector addition and cosine distance. Results indicate an inverse relationship between TRE(x) and human ratings of compositionality for specific collocations. BID7 introduces the concept of topographic similarity to assess representations with oracle derivations, focusing on the correlation between distances in learned representations and derivations. The paper introduces a distance function for derivations in tree-structured data, showing that representations cannot be much farther apart than the derivations that produce them. Proof is provided in the appendix. The paper introduces a distance function for derivations in tree-structured data, showing that representations cannot be much farther apart than the derivations that produce them. Proof is provided in Appendix B. Small Total Rank Error (TRE) is not enough for topographic similarity as defined by BID7. Compositionality imposes constraints on inferences from similarity judgments between representations. Experiments investigate the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games. In the final set of experiments, the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games is investigated. Agents are trained from random initial conditions to measure the compositional structure of the language that emerges. The speaker model describes target objects to the listener model, who reconstructs the targets based on the description. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where two policies, a speaker and a listener, are trained to communicate about target objects using discrete codes. The speaker sends a message to the listener, who reconstructs the targets based on the message received. Rewards are given for correct predictions. The speaker sends a message to the listener, who reconstructs the targets based on the message received. Both speaker and listener receive a reward for correct predictions. The communication protocol is discrete, and policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective. The communication protocol involves two objects with two attributes each. A subset of object pairs is held out during training for evaluation. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes with complex semantics. Agent messages are represented as one-hot vectors. The communication protocol involves fixed-length discrete codes with complex semantics. Agent messages are represented as one-hot vectors, with a composition function that captures non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages show lower absolute performance, even in \"successful\" training runs where agents achieve a reward > 0.5.

The training results suggest a nuanced relationship between compositionality, generalization, and performance. Our results show a nuanced relationship between compositionality, generalization, and performance in a communication protocol using fixed-length discrete codes. The correlation between Total Reward Error (TRE) and generalization error suggests that \"compositional\" languages often stem from poor communication strategies. However, low TRE is not a necessary condition for good generalization. The correlation between Total Reward Error (TRE) and generalization error suggests that \"compositional\" languages often stem from poor communication strategies. Low TRE is not necessary for good generalization, as shown by our technique for mining languages achieving good generalization at different levels of compositionality.
