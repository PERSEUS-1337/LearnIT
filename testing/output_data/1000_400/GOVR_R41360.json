    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or coercive sterilization with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Congressional debates on these issues have been ongoing since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. Members of Congress have debated issues related to health services in developing countries, particularly in connection with U.S. abortion policy since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. Legislation has been introduced to prohibit abortion in the U.S. and restrict federal funding for abortions. Discussions have expanded from domestic authorization to include foreign aid appropriations. Since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, debates in Congress have expanded to include restrictions on federal funding for abortions in both domestic and foreign aid appropriations. President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to refrain from performing or promoting abortion as a method of family planning. The \"Mexico City policy,\" implemented by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. This policy has been rescinded and reinstated by various Administrations, most recently by President Trump in 2017. The 115th Congress continues to debate restrictions on abortion and family planning activities abroad. During the 115th Congress, debates continued on restrictions regarding abortion and family planning activities abroad. Some Members sought to modify language in State-Foreign Operations legislation, while others introduced bills to make the Mexico City policy permanent law. Federal funding for these activities remains controversial in foreign assistance, with ongoing congressional interest expected in the next session. The report examines legislative and executive branch policies on U.S. funding for abortion and family planning abroad. The report discusses legislative and executive branch policies that restrict U.S. funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. Many restrictions are included in foreign aid authorizations and appropriations, affecting different types of foreign assistance. Congressional interest in this controversial issue is expected to continue into the next session. Legislation authorizing foreign aid, like the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, covers various types of assistance such as development, military, and debt reduction. Provisions are named after lawmakers or subjects they address, like the \"Helms amendment\" or \"involuntary sterilization.\" These laws establish, continue, or modify aid programs for specific or indefinite periods. The Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) authorizes different types of foreign aid, including development assistance, military and security assistance, and debt reduction. Congress has amended the FAA since 1961 but has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs since 1985. Authorization bills often face debates on controversial issues, tight legislative calendars, or foreign policy disputes, leading Congress to consider annual appropriations measures instead. In the absence of regular foreign aid authorizations, Congress annually considers appropriations measures setting spending levels for foreign assistance accounts. Recent measures increasingly influence how U.S. foreign aid is distributed, often including family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The complex links among requirements and restrictions are not always immediately apparent, with amendments like the Helms and Biden provisions being added to other foreign assistance legislation. The complex links among various abortion-related restrictions and requirements in U.S. foreign aid legislation are not always immediately apparent. Amendments like the Helms and Biden provisions may be added to different legislation for emphasis or to apply to additional categories of foreign aid. Some restrictions stand alone, while others seek to clarify or amend existing restrictions. For example, the Leahy amendment defines the term \"motivate\" in the Helms amendment, and the Livingston amendment clarifies prohibitions in the DeConcini amendment. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals. It was introduced in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms to address concerns about federal funds being used for abortions overseas. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals. It was adopted as an amendment to the FAA to address concerns about federal funds being used for abortions overseas. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA, including development assistance. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes the amendment in two sections, ensuring that foreign assistance activities are not used for involuntary sterilizations or coercion. The FAA prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion. This provision was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act to ensure compliance with the Helms amendment.

The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits funding abortions for Peace Corps volunteers, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Medical evacuation for abortions is not restricted, and the Peace Corps covers the cost to locations where abortions are legally permissible. Congress also passed an amendment in 1981 prohibiting foreign assistance for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Peace Corps covers the cost of evacuation for abortions in locations where they are legally permissible. The Biden amendment prohibits funding for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Biden amendment prohibits funding for abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning in foreign assistance activities. The Siljander amendment specifies that no U.S. funds may be used to lobby for or against abortion in annual foreign operations appropriations acts. The Siljander amendment prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign operations appropriations acts. Congress modified the amendment to include this restriction. In 1985, Congress enacted a provision to the FY1986 Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act specifying that the United States would only fund family planning projects that offer a range of family planning methods and services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. The measure was introduced to counter a Reagan Administration policy that funded overseas groups advocating only \"natural\" family planning methods. The provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985. To reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations, funds are available only to family planning projects offering a broad range of methods and services. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY1986 Foreign Assistance Act also included a provision stating that funds may not be used if they violate the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a provision that prohibits funds from being used for any country or organization if the President certifies that the use of such funds would violate the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision applies to all foreign assistance activities in the act. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a provision known as the Kemp-Kasten amendment, which prohibits funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since 1985. The Kemp-Kasten amendment in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs, specifically targeting the UNFPA's program in China. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since 1985. The Kemp-Kasten amendment in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act targets organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs, particularly the UNFPA in China. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since 1985, with the US withholding funding from UNFPA for violating the Kemp-Kasten amendment in 16 of the past 34 years. The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to violations of the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing commitment to family planning and women's health. The Trump Administration determined that UNFPA supports coercive abortion in China. Congress has raised concerns about UNFPA's program in China. The Trump Administration determined that UNFPA supports coercive abortion in China, leading to restrictions on U.S. funding. Congress enacted conditions for funding UNFPA, including restrictions on funds for China programs and segregation of U.S. contributions. The Trump Administration restricted U.S. funding to UNFPA due to concerns about coercive abortion in China. Congress imposed conditions on funding, including restrictions on funds for China programs and segregation of U.S. contributions. The Secretary must report UNFPA's budget for China programs within four months of the act's enactment. If funds are allocated, they will be deducted from UNFPA's budget for that fiscal year. In 1986, an amendment prohibited discrimination based on religious beliefs for grants related to natural family planning. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination against organizations that offer only natural family planning methods when awarding family planning grants, as long as they comply with certain requirements. The United States funds family planning projects that offer a range of methods and services, without discrimination against organizations supporting natural family planning. The provision is included in foreign operations appropriations, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding funds for abortions. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding funds for abortions and family planning assistance, addressing concerns about violating the Helms amendment by providing information or counseling on legal pregnancy options. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of funds for abortion and family planning assistance, but the Leahy amendment clarifies that providing information or counseling about all pregnancy options is allowed. This amendment has been included in various forms in foreign operations appropriations since 1998. The Tiahrt amendment, enacted in 1998, directs voluntary family planning projects supported by the United States to comply with specific requirements. It has been included in foreign operations appropriations each fiscal year since. The provision states that funds are only available to projects that do not implement quotas or numerical targets for births. The Tiahrt amendment, included in foreign operations appropriations annually, mandates that funds for voluntary family planning projects can only be used if they meet specific requirements regarding quotas and incentives. The project for voluntary family planning must adhere to specific requirements: no payment of incentives or bribes for accepting family planning services, no denial of rights for not accepting services, provision of comprehensive information on chosen methods, and ensuring experimental contraceptive drugs are safe. The project for voluntary family planning must provide comprehensible information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods, ensure experimental contraceptives are only used in scientific studies, and report violations to the Committees on Appropriations. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must report any violations of family planning requirements to the Committees on Appropriations. An amendment was introduced to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilizations in Peru. The Tiahrt amendment was introduced to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilizations in Peru and other countries. USAID issued guidance on implementing the amendment for voluntary family planning projects, but reports of violations have been found in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 by the USAID Inspector General found compliance issues with the amendment in various operating units. The Tiahrt amendment was enacted to prevent forced sterilizations in foreign countries. USAID reported violations in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 found compliance issues, but a later report in 2008 showed no further violations. The amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, applying to family planning assistance. Additionally, two executive branch policies address abortion and voluntary family planning: the Mexico City policy and USAID Policy Determination 3 on voluntary sterilization. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. It has been implemented and reversed through executive branch actions, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" has been implemented and reversed through executive branch actions, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently reinstated and expanded the policy to include all global health assistance, making it a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortions or involuntary sterilizations. Foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance must certify in writing that they do not promote abortion as a method of family planning. The Mexico City policy, implemented under President Reagan, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they do not promote abortion. President George H. W. Bush maintained the policy, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001 and 2003. Exceptions were made for cases of rape, incest, threats to the mother's life, and postabortion care. President Bush expanded the Mexico City policy in August 2003 to include all voluntary population planning assistance to foreign NGOs by the State Department. Exceptions were made for cases of rape, incest, threats to the mother's life, and postabortion care. President Obama revoked the policy in January 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants. President Trump reinstated the policy in January 2017, expanding it to include global health.

The PLGHA policy includes programs addressing HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning and reproductive health. Exemptions are provided for rape, incest, conditions threatening the life of the mother, and postabortion care. In May 2018, a six-month review was published summarizing the implementation of PLGHA based on feedback from U.S. government agencies, health groups, and NGOs. The Trump Administration's \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy includes exemptions for rape, incest, and conditions threatening the mother's life, as well as postabortion care. A six-month review in May 2018 acknowledged challenges in implementing the policy, with some recipients refusing to agree to its terms. Improving understanding of the policy's intent, compliance, and oversight was identified as a key action item. The Trump Administration's \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy faced challenges with some subrecipients refusing to agree to its terms. Improving understanding of the policy's intent, compliance, and oversight was identified as a key action item. USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization in September 1982 to ensure protection of individuals' needs and rights during funded services.
