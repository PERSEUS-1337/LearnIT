    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1993\" establishes a program for research on women and AIDS. This includes a new section on research regarding women in the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary shall establish a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. Research will focus on HIV transmission to women, the link between HIV and other STDs, and clinical trials on preventing HIV through STD treatment in women. Research will focus on measures for preventing the transmission of HIV to women, including the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases that may facilitate HIV transmission, rapid diagnostic tests for STDs in women, affordable single-dose therapy for treatable STDs, and the development of prevention methods. Research will also cover the development and progression of symptoms resulting from infection with the virus, including gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, and menopause changes. Additionally, prevention programs and materials will be developed to reduce substance abuse among women. The research will focus on the development and progression of symptoms from virus infection, including gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, and menopause changes. Clinical trials will also address treatment and behavioral research for prevention. The Secretary shall ensure that female subjects infected with HIV undergo gynecological evaluations in clinical trials, with appropriate follow-up services. Results will be analyzed to determine the relationship between gynecological conditions and HIV infection. The Secretary will conduct clinical trials to evaluate gynecological conditions in HIV-infected females, analyze the results for the relationship between conditions and HIV infection, and determine the effectiveness of standard treatments for these conditions. The Secretary will conduct clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols for gynecological conditions in HIV-infected women, providing support services such as transportation and child care. The Secretary will provide support services, including transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, and treatment for drug abuse, to enable women to participate in clinical trials under this title. Services will address the particular needs of women, including training for trial conductors. The Secretary will provide support services for women to participate in clinical trials, including training for trial conductors. Research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, that women can use without their partner's knowledge will be conducted or supported. The Secretary will prioritize research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases in women, including HIV, without their partner's knowledge. This includes research on early infectious stages and developing new preparations. The Secretary will conduct research on topical microbicides, focusing on early infectious stages, formulation of new preparations, clinical testing, and acceptability studies. Additionally, epidemiological research will be done to identify risk factors for HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods. The Secretary will conduct epidemiological research to determine risk factors for HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods, tampons, relationship with other STDs, substance abuse, and sexual activity. The Secretary will conduct a study on the relationship between HIV infection in women and substance abuse, sexual activity, and the progression of the virus. The study aims to include at least 5,000 women with HIV infection. The Women's Interagency HIV Study will include at least 5,000 women with HIV infection and will last for a minimum of 8 years. The study will focus on the relationship between CD4 cells and the development of serious illnesses in women with HIV. The Secretary will ensure a study on women with HIV infection addresses the relationship between CD4 cells and serious illnesses. The study will cover gynecological and other conditions specific to women not currently included in the CDC's list for surveillance. The term 'human immunodeficiency virus' refers to the agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Authorization of appropriations is provided for clinical trials. The term 'human immunodeficiency virus' refers to the agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Authorization of appropriations is provided for clinical trials, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 1994 through 1996. For fiscal years 1994 through 1996, specific amounts are authorized to be appropriated for carrying out subsections (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of the clinical trials related to human immunodeficiency virus. For fiscal years 1994 through 1996, specific amounts are authorized to be appropriated for prevention programs related to human immunodeficiency virus. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1995 and 1996. For fiscal years 1994 through 1996, specific amounts are authorized to be appropriated for prevention programs related to human immunodeficiency virus. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1995 through 1996 for various subsections."
