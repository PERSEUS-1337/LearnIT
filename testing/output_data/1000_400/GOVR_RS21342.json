It allocates immigrant visas based on family ties and employment needs. The program was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1990 to promote new and varied migration. The lottery began in FY1995 and offers 55,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years. The diversity lottery, established in FY1995, allocates 55,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years.

The Diversity Visa Lottery program, established in 1995, allocates 55,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years. Each country is limited to 7% of the visa limit, with Northern Ireland treated separately. Recipients become legal permanent residents of the US. The program has not been directly amended since its inception, but the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 temporarily reduces the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries for diversity visas were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. These countries consistently rank among the top diversity visa senders. In FY2002, immigrants from Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine comprised 3.9% of all LPRs. These countries consistently ranked among the top diversity visa senders, along with Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Morocco, Romania, and Russia. Albania and Nigeria were the top sending countries, with Russia and Ukraine possibly understated due to reporting issues. In FY2002, immigrants from Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine were among the top diversity visa senders. Russia and Ukraine's numbers may be understated due to reporting issues from nationals born in the Soviet Union. European and African immigrants dominated diversity visas, while Caribbean, Latin American, and Asian immigrants were more prevalent in family-based and employment-based immigration. In FY2002, diversity visas were dominated by European and African immigrants, with African immigrants receiving a significant portion of the visas. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must have a high school education or two years of relevant work experience. Visa winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure compliance. The diversity visa lottery winners must be natives of eligible countries and undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure they meet the criteria for exclusion under various categories. The FY2005 lottery was announced in August 2003 with a 60-day application period. The FY2005 diversity visa lottery had eligibility criteria including criminal history, security concerns, and public charge issues. Applications had to be submitted electronically for the first time, with ineligible countries including Canada, China, India, and Mexico. The application period ran from November 1 to December 30, 2003. For FY2005 diversity visa lottery, paper forms were not accepted. Natives of countries with high admissions were usually ineligible, including Canada, China, India, Mexico, and others. Petitioners had to follow State Department instructions precisely to avoid disqualification. Over 2 million applications were disqualified in FY2003 for not complying with instructions. Multiple applications from the same alien were supposed to be disqualified, but spouses could submit separate entries. In the FY2003 diversity visa lottery, over 2 million applications were disqualified for not following instructions. Aliens submitting more than one application should be disqualified, but spouses can submit separate entries. Derivative beneficiaries must be listed on the petition initially, and if the winner dies, the visa is revoked. Winners were selected randomly by computer, and unsuccessful petitioners were not notified. Visas from the diversity lottery are subject to a 50,000 cap. If a winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked, and derivative beneficiaries lose their eligibility. Winners are selected randomly by computer, and notifications are sent out between May and July 2004. Winning the lottery does not guarantee a visa, as more applications are drawn than visas available. Applicants must act quickly to demonstrate admissibility as LPRs. Winners of the diversity visa lottery must act quickly to file necessary documentation by September 30, 2005 to receive visas. Some question the continuation of the lottery, suggesting the visas be used for backlog reduction in other categories. Supporters argue that the diversity visa provides new immigrants from a variety of countries. Critics argue for amending the INA to prevent nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from participating in the diversity visa lottery due to background check difficulties and terrorism concerns. Supporters of the diversity visa highlight its role in providing new immigrants for a system dominated by family-based immigrants. Critics suggest amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from the diversity visa lottery due to background check challenges and terrorism risks. Supporters argue for maintaining the current policy, noting that LPRs from such countries can enter the US through other visa categories. The issue of who should bear the costs of operating the lottery has also been raised, with some proposing a fee to enter the lottery. Despite criticism of the diversity visa for being susceptible to fraud, the State Department asserts that they are addressing these concerns."
