The Act \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\" highlights findings on severe poverty in the developing world, high child mortality rates, and the impact of aiding women in poverty on family well-being. Women in the developing world face limited access to education and economic opportunities compared to men. Directly assisting the poorest, especially women, can improve family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Many women in poverty rely on self-employment but struggle to access credit to grow their businesses. The poor entrepreneurs face challenges in accessing credit at reasonable rates, leading them to pay high interest rates to money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, benefiting nearly half of the world's absolute poor. The Microcredit Summit aimed to provide business services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. This goal would benefit nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor by expanding their incomes and businesses through access to loans at reasonable interest rates. NGOs like Grameen Bank, Accion International, and FINCA have successfully lent directly to the very poor, enabling them to lead the fight against hunger and poverty. Microcredit institutions, led by NGOs like Grameen Bank, Accion International, and FINCA, have successfully lent to the very poor, with repayment rates averaging 95% or higher. These institutions not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign assistance by leveraging interest income to cover institutional costs and recycle loans for sustainable development. Microcredit institutions leverage foreign assistance resources by recycling loans to generate new benefits for program participants. The development of sustainable microcredit institutions is crucial for global poverty reduction and economic development. AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative in 1994 to expand funding for microenterprise programs, with a goal to support credit programs by the end of fiscal year 1996. The Microenterprise Initiative aimed to increase funding for AID's microenterprise programs, setting a goal for half of resources to support credit programs for the poorest with loans under $300 by 1996. However, funding fell in 1996, with only 39% benefiting the poorest. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to align with the growing capacity of microcredit. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the Microcredit Summit will require only a modest increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest. In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microcredit institutions. Microcredit institutions need assistance in developing. To reach millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand successful microcredit institutions. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions for the very poor. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations to enhance their institutional capacity and tap commercial sources of capital. To expand successful microcredit institutions for the very poor, AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and NGOs to create a global infrastructure for financial services. AID can lead in supporting microenterprise for the poorest and improve coordination efforts among development aid agencies. The Act aims to expand AID's commitment to developing microcredit institutions and making microenterprise the focus of AID's economic growth strategy. It also seeks to enhance coordination efforts among development aid agencies to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor. The Act aims to expand AID's commitment to developing microcredit institutions, making microenterprise the focus of AID's economic growth strategy, supporting US PVOs and international NGOs in providing credit and training services to microentrepreneurs, and increasing assistance for providing credit access to the poorest sectors in developing countries, especially women. The Act aims to expand AID's commitment to developing microcredit institutions, focusing on microenterprise as part of its economic growth strategy. The Act defines terms like \"AID\", \"microcredit\", \"microenterprise\", and \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\" in the context of the 1994 Microenterprise Initiative of AID. \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\" refer to private voluntary organizations, including cooperative organizations, and international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations active in the project's region with the capacity to develop microenterprise programs for the poor, especially women. SEC. 4. MICROENTERPRISE ASSISTANCE. The President, through the Administrator of AID, is authorized to establish programs for microenterprise assistance in developing countries. Programs will be carried out by US PVOs and other organizations. Eligibility criteria will be set by the Administrator of AID to determine eligible entities for carrying out the purposes described. The Administrator of AID will establish eligibility criteria for entities to provide microenterprise assistance in developing countries. Criteria include access to formal financial sector, serving the poorest, focusing on poor women, and self-reliance through realistic interest rates. Funding levels for Fiscal Year 1999 will be determined accordingly. The entity providing microenterprise assistance must work directly with poor women and implement a plan for financial self-reliance by charging realistic interest rates. Funding levels for Fiscal Year 1999 will ensure at least $160,000,000 is used for assistance under this Act. In addition to funds for microenterprise activities in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe under the FREEDOM Support Act, funds are allocated for special assistance initiatives in Europe, the newly independent states of the Former Soviet Union, Asia, and the Near East. $80,000,000 is designated for poverty lending, and $35,000,000 is allocated for support of United States PVOs and NGOs through AID's central funding mechanisms. The funds allocated for poverty lending and support of United States PVOs and NGOs through AID's central funding mechanisms are specified. At least $35,000,000 is designated for PVOs and NGOs, while $10,000,000 is allocated for a matching grant program for PVOs. The term \"to support poverty lending\" is defined. $10,000,000 allocated for private voluntary organizations matching grant program of AID to support United States PVOs. Definitions include funds for poverty lending to target population in low-income countries. The curr_chunk discusses funds allocated for institutional development of entities engaged in making loans of $300 or less to the poorest 50% of individuals living below the poverty line in low-income countries. The curr_chunk discusses program performance criteria for funds allocated for institutional development of entities making small loans to the poorest individuals in low-income countries. The Administrator of AID will strengthen mechanisms for microenterprise programs and develop mechanisms for targeting microcredit to the poorest population. A monitoring system will be established to measure project performance and goals objectively. The Administrator of AID will establish a monitoring system to set performance goals, measure project achievements, and recommend adjustments to enhance assistance for the very poor, especially women. Additionally, data from lending institutions will be used to monitor the amount of microenterprise credit and loans provided to the poverty target population. The Administrator of AID will monitor microenterprise credit and loans for the very poor, especially women, using data from lending institutions. Reporting to Congress annually on progress in implementing AID's institutional plan of action is required. The Administrator of AID will monitor funding allocated to organizations providing loans under $300 to the poverty target population. They will report annually to Congress on progress towards expanding access to credit for the world's poorest families, especially women, and include this information in AID's annual presentation to Congress."
