    "content": "Since the 1930s, federal job training and employment programs have aimed to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. WIA includes titles for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation, with youth programs falling under Title I and administered by the Department of Labor. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for adults, youth, and dislocated workers. Youth job training programs under Title I include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. These programs aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. Funding for WIA programs continues through annual appropriation acts. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for adults, youth, and dislocated workers. Youth programs aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. WIA programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the near future. Relevant provisions of two bills are discussed: H.R. 803 and Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). The discussion includes key provisions of two bills: H.R. 803 and the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). Job training and employment services for youth under WIA encompass various programs such as WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants for youth job training and education. Although WIA's authorization expired in FY2003, Congress continues to fund these programs, except for Youth Opportunity Grants which have not been funded since FY2003. These programs are managed by the Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration. Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, with the exception of the YOG program which has not been funded since FY2003. These programs, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and the youth component of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, aim to connect low-income youth with educational and employment opportunities. YouthBuild specifically targets high school dropouts, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth involved in the justice system. Youth Opportunity Grants programs aim to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. Each program serves youth with specific employment barriers, with YouthBuild targeting high school dropouts. The programs provide employment and educational services in different ways, such as mentoring and construction work. Job Corps is the only program offering residential services. Under the Youth Activities program, local areas must provide 10 specific elements to youth, including mentoring and follow-up. YouthBuild participants engage in construction work, while Job Corps offers residential services. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program provides various activities for youth returning from secure facilities. Funding for these programs is allocated differently, with DOL distributing funds to local WIBs for Youth Activities and entering agreements with organizations to operate Job Corps centers. The programs for youth include Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program. Funding is allocated differently for each program, with DOL distributing funds to local WIBs for Youth Activities and entering agreements with organizations to operate Job Corps centers. Congress is working towards reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40929 on Vulnerable Youth: Employment and Job Training Programs. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program awards grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress is taking steps to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act, with recent hearings addressing issues related to WIA youth programs. Stakeholders have discussed ways to improve the Youth Activities grant program during listening sessions held by the Senate HELP Committee. The Senate HELP Committee and House Education and Workforce Committee held hearings to discuss updating the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to address issues related to youth employment and job training programs. Discussions focused on refining the law to improve the Youth Activities grant program and modernizing WIA to meet the demands of a changing economy. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to address declining youth employment and update job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Legislation was introduced to reauthorize WIA, with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordering reported the SKILLS Act in the 113th Congress. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was passed by the House and a similar bill, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356), was introduced in the Senate. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) was introduced in the Senate by Senators Patty Murray, Lamar Alexander, Tom Harkin, and Johnny Isakson on July 24, 2013. The Senate HELP Committee ordered the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3 on July 31, 2013. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth to make them more efficient and less costly. Proposed consolidation of workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth aims to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Concerns exist that at-risk youth and other vulnerable groups may be overlooked if programs are collectively funded. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, like education, is seen as crucial to meeting the diverse needs of youth as intended by WIA. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies, such as youth councils, in addressing youth needs effectively. The perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, such as education, is a key issue. Stakeholders believe that greater coordination can help meet the varied needs of youth as intended by WIA. Congress is interested in the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with only Job Corps having completed an impact evaluation so far. An impact evaluation of YouthBuild is also underway. Additionally, there are specific concerns regarding Youth Activities and Job Corps eligibility requirements. Congress is interested in issues specific to Youth Activities and Job Corps eligibility requirements. State and local workforce officials have concerns about income eligibility requirements potentially excluding needy youth. The emphasis on serving older youth is also a separate concern. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. The requirements for the Youth Activities program are crucial to ensure enrollment of vulnerable young people. There is a debate on whether the program should focus on serving older youth, aged 22-24, and whether federal funding should be provided for Job Corps centers. Stakeholders are also discussing the school status of youth in the program and the eligibility age for participation. The Youth Activities program is under scrutiny for its focus on out-of-school youth and the age eligibility for participation. Congress is considering federal funding for Job Corps centers due to concerns about mixed performance outcomes and low-performing centers. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted the overlap in federal workforce programs, noting differences in services and populations served. The report highlighted overlap in federal workforce programs, recommending consolidation of selected programs. Legislation has aimed to consolidate certain workforce programs in the past. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to consolidate various workforce programs, including those for youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. Job Corps would remain separate, with substantive changes proposed. The 113th Congress aims to consolidate workforce programs, including those for youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. Job Corps would remain separate, with substantive changes proposed, such as providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system. Services would include assessment of skills, job search assistance, career planning, case management, internship, and work experience. Funding allocation to states would consider factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. The proposed bill aims to enhance workforce programs for youth by providing services like career planning, case management, internships, and work experience at one-stop centers. States would receive funding based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth, with a portion set aside for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment. Eligible individuals must be 16 or older, low-income, or from low-income families. Grants could be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. The proposed bill aims to enhance workforce programs for youth by providing services like career planning, case management, internships, and work experience at one-stop centers. States could award grants to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services to individuals with barriers to employment, including at-risk and out-of-school youth. Eligible individuals must be 16 or older, low-income, or from low-income families. State and local workforce investment boards would be required to describe strategies and services to assist youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth aged 16-24 in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. It defines at-risk youth as low-income high school dropouts, youth in foster care, offenders, those with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. At-risk youth aged 16-24, defined as low-income high school dropouts, foster care youth, offenders, those with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth, could be affected by the proposed consolidation of workforce programs under H.R. 803. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced funding for youth programs, including Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program. S. 1356 aims to maintain these programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants. S. 1356 does not allocate a specific amount of funding for youth programs but appropriates $900,000 annually for Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and the youth component of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program. The bill also introduces Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) to improve education and employment outcomes for youth through competitive grants to states and localities. Consolidation of youth programs with other workforce programs may impact the role of one-stop centers in serving youth. One-stop centers play a crucial role in connecting adults and youth to job training, employment, and other services in a community. These centers, which are part of nearly 20 federal programs, use various methods to attract youth, but some areas face challenges in engaging them. Some local WIB directors use different methods to attract youth to one-stop centers, but some areas struggle to engage them. Recommendations include catering more to youth and providing better training for service professionals. DOL supports targeting youth by funding planning projects and providing guidance. DOL encourages one-stop centers to target youth by providing funding for planning projects and guidance on enhancing youth connections. Methods include co-locating youth program staff, cross-training staff, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" States would be required to continue funding one-stop centers under H.R. 803 and S. 1356. The bills H.R. 803 and S. 1356 require states to continue funding one-stop centers for job search and assistance, without specifying the extent of youth services. Local Workforce Investment Boards have youth councils responsible for developing workforce plans for eligible youth. The WIB youth council, composed of various stakeholders, is tasked with developing workforce plans for eligible youth. However, challenges have been identified in their ability to go beyond being advisory bodies. The Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Reports from GAO and DOL in 2002 highlighted difficulties in establishing youth councils, including issues with youth and parent participation due to transportation and scheduling conflicts. Innovative youth councils have succeeded by having established intermediary organizations and strong school-to-career partnerships. The Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has identified challenges faced by youth councils in expanding their roles beyond advisory positions to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Recommendations include the need for established intermediary organizations, strong school-to-career partnerships, and community-wide planning processes to leverage funds effectively. Stakeholders suggest giving youth councils more flexibility in choosing partners and priorities. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, suggesting they develop a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities and consolidate funding streams. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional, with H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress proposing this change. State boards would be required to have representatives with youth interests. H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress proposes making youth councils optional and requiring state boards to have representatives with youth interests. S. 1356 would change local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards (LWDB) and require LWDBs to establish standing committees for youth services. The bill would require LWDBs to establish standing committees for youth services, including community-based organizations with a successful track record. Existing entities can fulfill these requirements if they meet the criteria. Congress may consider best practices from existing youth councils to improve coordination between the workforce system and other youth-serving systems. The bill proposes establishing standing committees for youth services within LWDBs, potentially looking to existing youth councils for best practices. Coordination between the workforce system and education system is a key issue, with WIA already including provisions for collaboration. Stakeholders suggest that better coordination can address the diverse needs of youth. Some stakeholders suggest that greater coordination between local education entities and youth councils can help meet the multiple needs of youth as intended by WIA. Existing WIA infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils are seen as facilitators of this coordination, as discussed in a 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office on the Youth Activities program. The Government Accountability Office's 2004 report on the Youth Activities program highlighted collaboration between workforce and education systems, focusing on local WIBs contracting with entities to provide services to youth. The report found that about half of all youth received services through community-based organizations, secondary schools, and colleges. However, some educators were cautious about partnering due to perceived inconsistencies with schools' academic mission. For example, in Wisconsin, some schools hesitated to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds. Some education entities were cautious about partnering with WIA due to perceived inconsistencies with schools' academic mission. In Wisconsin, schools hesitated to allow WIA Youth Activities on school grounds. The Department of Labor and Department of Education are committed to ensuring that youth receive necessary services and supports. The Department of Labor and Department of Education are collaborating to provide services and support for youth, both in-school and out-of-school. They have previously worked together on programs like School-to-Work (STW) to combine work-based learning with job training. Congress could learn from the successes and challenges of such partnerships. The School-to-Work (STW) program combined work-based learning in schools with job training. H.R. 803, a reauthorization legislation, includes provisions for coordinating workforce and education systems, but this coordination is not explicit. Local areas could include education officials on workforce investment boards to assist youth in acquiring education and skills for the labor market. The reauthorization legislation H.R. 803 aims to coordinate workforce and education systems by including education officials on local workforce investment boards. This coordination would assist youth in acquiring education and skills needed for the labor market. Additionally, the Senate bill S. 1356 requires states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA, including education and vocational training programs. The reauthorization legislation H.R. 803 aims to coordinate workforce and education systems by including education officials on local workforce investment boards. Additionally, the Senate bill S. 1356 requires states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA, including education and vocational training programs. This plan must include an analysis of state economic conditions and goals for preparing a skilled workforce, including youth. Congress and stakeholders are concerned about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA in serving at-risk youth. Current law allows states the option of submitting a unified plan covering WIA Title I, WIA Title II, and activities under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education programs. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA in serving at-risk youth. Evaluations of Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs are limited. The three programs have met or exceeded their goals under a common set of performance measures known as the \"common measures.\" Section 172 of WIA requires continuous evaluation of programs and activities by the Department of Labor. The three programs under WIA have met or exceeded their goals set by the Department of Labor. Evaluations are required to assess their effectiveness and cost, with a focus on continuous evaluation as mandated by Section 172 of WIA. Legislation is being proposed to conduct independent evaluations every five years. Limited evaluations have been conducted on youth programs under WIA. The Department of Labor is required to conduct evaluations of programs funded under WIA every five years. Limited information is available on the effectiveness of these programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to determine the effectiveness of the programs. The Department of Labor is required to conduct evaluations of programs funded under WIA every five years. Limited information is available on the effectiveness of these programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to determine the effectiveness of the programs. None of the five programs identified in the GAO report were the youth programs authorized under WIA. Policy makers may have difficulty determining the effectiveness of these programs without proper evaluation. Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants, with limited comprehensive studies conducted primarily on program implementation. DOL has contracted a social science research organization to conduct an impact evaluation of YouthBuild. The Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants. DOL has contracted a research organization to evaluate YouthBuild's impact on youth employment. Initial results are expected in 2015. DOL also completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to identify practices associated with center performance. The Job Corps program underwent a process evaluation to assess center practices linked to performance measures such as job placement rate and post-program earnings. Factors like robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships were found to be associated with strong performance. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. Strong performance factors included robust student support, staff accountability, and partner relationships. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. A follow-up report analyzed the longer-term impacts of the program on earnings and employment rates 5 to 10 years after enrollment. The study found that while the positive employment effects diminished over time, older youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application saw increased earnings. The follow-up study found increased earnings for older youth aged 20-24 who applied for the program. WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs. H.R. 803 would eliminate current youth core performance measures and add new ones for participants in Workforce activities. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to replace current youth core performance measures with new indicators for participants in Workforce activities. These new measures include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, earnings change, attainment of credentials, and participation in education. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, introduces new performance indicators for participants in Workforce activities, including entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in employment, earnings change, attainment of credentials, and participation in education or training programs. These indicators aim to measure the success of eligible youth in the program. S. 1356 establishes performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities, including entry into education or employment, retention, earnings, credential attainment, skills gains, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States can add more indicators, and Job Corps operators must follow these measures. Section 136 of WIA outlines state and local performance measures for the Youth Activities program. S. 1356 requires performance measures for Job Corps operators based on indicators for youth in Youth Activities. State and local performance measures under WIA assess effectiveness and continuous improvement in workforce investment activities. State performance measures include core indicators and additional state-identified indicators. Under WIA, state performance measures for youth ages 14-18 include basic skills, secondary school diplomas, and postsecondary education or employment placement. For youth ages 19-21, the indicators are employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment. States negotiate performance levels with DOL to optimize federal funds in workforce investment activities. The core indicators for youth ages 19-21 under WIA include entry into employment, retention in employment, earnings, and attainment of a credential. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures may not fully capture the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to focus on higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. The Government Accountability Office found that some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted youth at a specific grade level to meet program goals. Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist lower-skilled youth while still achieving performance targets. In response to a report by the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to state workforce agencies on strategies to help service providers serve youth most in need while still meeting performance goals. The guidance focused on six key strategies, including multiyear contracting, using real-time indicators for performance assessment, and creating positive incentives for providers to enroll and assist at-risk youth. The 2010 Department of Labor guidance focused on strategies to help service providers serve at-risk youth while meeting performance goals. It emphasized factors like participant characteristics, positive incentives for enrollment, and interagency collaboration. The guidance also suggested using common measures for flexibility in working with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 Department of Labor guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Some suggest adjusting performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations. Some recommendations include adjusting performance levels for workforce investment boards serving higher-risk youth populations, similar to the DOL guidance. Insights from the Job Training Partnership Act suggest adjustments based on economic and demographic factors for areas serving the neediest youth. The WIA reauthorization allowed for adjustments to national performance standards for youth and other populations. Governors adjusted standards for service delivery areas based on economic and demographic factors. The process aimed to level the playing field across areas with different conditions, using DOL adjustment models or state-developed approaches. WIA requires Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including measures for entered employment, average wage, and retention. Under JTPA, areas with varying local conditions used DOL adjustment models or state-approved approaches. WIA mandates Job Corps to establish 20+ core performance metrics, covering outcomes like entered employment and average wage. DOL has added 33 performance metrics based on GPRA requirements. A 2011 DOL Inspector General report raised concerns about Job Corps' implementation of these metrics. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report to Congress. A 2011 DOL Inspector General report raised concerns about Job Corps' inaccurate performance metrics and cost calculations. YouthBuild program applicants must include descriptions of results for common performance indicators. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, includes performance indicators for grantees such as employment or education placement, degree attainment, and literacy gains. DOL will provide further details on performance indicators through administrative guidance. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, includes performance indicators for grantees such as employment or education placement, degree attainment, and literacy gains. DOL will provide further details on performance indicators through administrative guidance, including retention and recidivism rates for program participants. The YouthBuild program focuses on placing participants in employment or education after exit, with a goal of reducing recidivism rates. Stakeholders are discussing eligibility criteria and the program's emphasis on serving out-of-school and older youth. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would be required to have strategies and services to assist participants. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would need to have strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth ages 16 through 24. Eligibility for the Youth Activities formula program includes being age 14 through 21, low-income, and having barriers like deficient literacy skills or being homeless. States and localities would not be required to serve a specific percentage of these young people or allocate a minimum amount of funding for such services. The Youth Activities formula program eligibility includes being age 14 through 21, low-income, and having barriers like deficient literacy skills or being homeless. There is ongoing discussion about the extent to which youth should prove their low-income status for the program. State and local officials find documenting income eligibility challenging. State and local officials find it challenging to document youth's income eligibility for the WIA Youth program, diverting resources from service delivery. State and local workforce officials find it challenging to document youth's eligibility for the WIA Youth program, including income requirements and other criteria like involvement in foster care or the justice system. Youth may face difficulties providing necessary documentation, such as criminal records, if they have run away or are homeless. Challenges exist in obtaining documentation to prove eligibility for the WIA Youth program, such as involvement in foster care, the justice system, or being a runaway or homeless youth. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria, but DOL cannot waive participant eligibility requirements. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility for the WIA Youth program, but waivers for participant eligibility cannot be allowed by DOL. Some stakeholders have expressed concerns about the lack of flexibility in documenting income and other eligibility factors under WIA regulations. Some states and localities have preferred using certain eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act. Some states and localities preferred using specific eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act, for the WIA Youth program in 2002. In-school youth were eligible if they qualified for the federal free lunch program or participated in a program authorized under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for low-income school districts. Out-of-school youth were eligible if they were economically disadvantaged. Other stakeholders suggested adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty census tracts or Youth Opportunity grant program sites for automatic eligibility. Some stakeholders propose expanding eligibility for WIA Youth program to include at-risk youth like dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth, regardless of income. The goal is to serve the most vulnerable youth, but it is uncertain how changing eligibility requirements would impact the number of eligible youth. The WIA Youth program aims to serve vulnerable youth, but there are concerns about eligibility criteria. Stakeholders suggest including at-risk youth like dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth, regardless of income. There is a debate on whether changing eligibility requirements to means-tested programs would affect the number of eligible youth. Additionally, there is a discussion on focusing more on out-of-school youth in the Youth Activities program. The WIA Youth program faces challenges in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth, who are more costly to serve and harder to maintain contact with. Stakeholders suggest allocating more funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, even those still in school. Local officials have difficulty maintaining contact with out-of-school youth, who also face transportation challenges. Stakeholders propose allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, including those still in school. Some suggest prioritizing out-of-school youth, while others advocate for maintaining current funding levels but increasing technical assistance to states. Prior legislation in Congress proposed prioritizing out-of-school youth for WIA funds, but some argue for maintaining current funding levels while increasing technical assistance. DOL has provided guidance on serving out-of-school and at-risk in-school youth, recommending strong alternative education programs. DOL issued guidance recommending strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth, funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants, and provided $3.4 million to reconnect youth who have dropped out to education pathways. Successful strategies included technical assistance networks and resource lists for out-of-school youth. The 2004 report for DOL addressed the implementation of WIA programs for out-of-school youth, highlighting successful strategies such as technical assistance networks, resource lists, and contracting with service providers for GED and vocational training. Currently, youth aged 14-21 are eligible for WIA, with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extending services to youth up to age 24. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extended WIA Youth services to youth up to age 24 to reach a growing number of unemployed young adults. Research suggests that many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage and high living costs. This extended transition period complicates the journey to adulthood for vulnerable youth populations. Many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage, high living costs, and additional educational opportunities. For vulnerable youth populations, challenges include family conflict, obstacles to employment, and being disconnected from work or school. Addressing older disconnected youth in WIA reauthorization legislation may strain program resources if funding remains stable. Older youth, particularly those disconnected from work or school, may need to be targeted in WIA reauthorization legislation. Increasing the age limit for the program could strain resources if funding remains stable. DOL has advised workforce systems to co-enroll older youth in both Youth and Adult Activities programs to meet their needs. The age limit for the Youth program under WIA may be expanded to include older youth, ages 22 through 24, resulting in an increase in the number of youth seeking services. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both Youth and Adult Activities programs to meet individual needs, such as receiving mentoring services under the Youth program and funding occupational skills training through the Adult program. It is unclear how youth ages 18 through 21 decide to participate in either program or both. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% to 34.8% in recent years. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% to 34.8% in recent years, compared to youth ages 18 through 21 in the Adult Activities program. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring, while the Adult program focuses on occupational skills training. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services, as well as leadership development and community service activities. In contrast, the Adult program provides information on dropout services, job search assistance, workplace training, and related instruction. Both programs offer occupational skills training and links to employment, with a higher emphasis on academic services in the Youth program. The Youth program focuses on leadership development, community service activities, and supportive services like child care and transportation. In contrast, the Adult program provides referrals to services and emphasizes occupational skills training. The Youth program focuses on leadership development, community service activities, and supportive services like child care and transportation. The Adult program provides referrals to services and emphasizes occupational skills training. The Department of Labor published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance ratings and on-board strength criteria. The Department of Labor is considering closing a number of chronically low-performing centers based on performance ratings, on-board strength, and facility condition criteria. They aim to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, while exempting certain centers and considering the impact on specific student subpopulations. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers based on performance, on-board strength, and facility condition criteria. They aim to keep at least one center in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, while exempting certain centers and considering the impact on specific student subpopulations. The closures are part of DOL's reform agenda to improve center performance, with federal oversight and a focus on maximizing results within budget constraints. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers to improve performance and maximize results within budget constraints. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve centers and close those that do not improve, with new performance measures and criteria for closure after four consecutive years of low performance. The bill H.R. 803 requires the Department of Labor to develop a program improvement plan for centers reporting less than 50% on performance indicators. Centers low-performing for more than four years will be closed, with an audit ranking centers based on performance and incidents of violence. Within 12 months, the bottom 25 centers will be closed. The bill H.R. 803 mandates the closure of Job Corps centers ranked in the bottom quintile of performance indicators within 12 months of enactment. Previous proposals to close underperforming centers have been considered but not implemented. The DOL was tasked with identifying inefficient Job Corps centers, but they were not closed. Legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming centers based on various criteria. There was also a proposal to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to states. The 104th Congress proposed transferring Job Corps operations from the federal government to states, citing states' ability to manage centers integrated with workforce development systems. Some members objected, fearing states could reduce student numbers or limit access to programs outside their state. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) was passed, but differences between House and Senate bills were not resolved in a conference committee. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) passed, but differences between House and Senate bills were not resolved in a conference committee. The bill would direct the Secretary to determine center closures, establish performance levels, develop a performance improvement plan, and take required actions within a one-year period. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would require the DOL Secretary to establish performance levels and develop a performance improvement plan within a one-year period. Common measures include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy gains. ETA implemented common measures in 2003 for various workforce programs. In 2003, ETA implemented common measures for workforce programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. The common measures include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy gains. ETA introduced three measures for youth and issued additional policy guidance on the common measures. These measures were not meant to replace existing statutory performance reporting requirements for WIA programs. ETA has issued additional policy guidance on common measures, stating they do not supersede existing statutory performance reporting requirements for WIA. States will continue to negotiate performance goals for indicators in the Youth Activities program. Common measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Table A-1 shows goals and outcomes for common measures in Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs for PY2011 and PY2012. Data for YouthBuild is based on aggregated program data from the 2007 grant cycle onwards. The common measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs include goals and outcomes for PY2011 and PY2012. The goals are set ambitiously and may be adjusted for individual grantees. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis to determine the relationship between outcomes and explanatory factors. DOL sets ambitious program goals for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, which may be adjusted for individual grantees. Performance targets are determined using regression analysis, considering factors like program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics. The targets for Job Corps are set similarly based on economic assumptions. The performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are set based on regression analysis considering program results, labor market conditions, and economic assumptions. Each program met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012, with placement in employment or education being a key measure of success. Placement in Employment or Education measures the success of youth who were not enrolled in postsecondary education or employed when they began the program. It includes those enrolled in postsecondary education, advanced training, occupational skills training, or employed in the first quarter after the exit quarter. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate measures the share of youth participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after the exit quarter.

It is only for out-of-school youth and is assessed through pre-tests administered up to six months prior to the first service received. The measure assesses out-of-school youth for increases in educational functional levels in reading, writing, and math. Pre-tests are administered up to six months before the first service, with regular testing required within one year of program entry. Those not basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on remediation. DOL provides guidance on test types and accommodations for disabilities.
