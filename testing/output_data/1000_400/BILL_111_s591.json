Future nuclear fuel inventories at reactor sites need to be managed for public safety and security, including transferring spent nuclear fuel to at-reactor dry casks after 7 years in a cooling pond. Long-term solutions for spent nuclear fuel management involve permanent deep geologic disposal for civilian and defense wastes, along with interim strategies for treating defense wastes. Additional management and technological advancements are also necessary. The Commission will consult with various stakeholders to make recommendations on the disposition of nuclear fuel inventories, including long-term solutions for permanent deep geologic disposal and interim strategies for treating defense wastes. Additional management and technological approaches will also be considered. The Commission, in consultation with stakeholders, will submit recommendations on the disposition of nuclear fuel inventories, including long-term deep geologic disposal and interim strategies for defense wastes.
