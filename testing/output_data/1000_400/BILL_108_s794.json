    "content": "The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" may be cited as the Act. It includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. The standards for model years after 2014 shall be 40 miles per gallon. Amendments include increasing the standard otherwise applicable and removing certain paragraphs. The amendment increases the fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles to 17 miles per gallon for model years after 1984 and before 2006. It removes certain paragraphs and realigns others within the text. The amendment raises the fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles to 17 miles per gallon for model years after 1984 and before 2006. It adjusts the standards for subsequent model years, increasing to 19, 21.5, 24.5, and 27.5 miles per gallon. The fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles is set to increase to 24.5 miles per gallon after model year 2011 and before model year 2015, and to 27.5 miles per gallon after model year 2014. If the Secretary does not increase the standard within 24 months after the latest increase, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not doing so. SEC. 3. Increased inclusiveness of definitions of automobile and passenger automobile. SEC. 3. Increased inclusiveness of definitions of automobile and passenger automobile. In general, the weight limits for automobiles are increased to 12,000 pounds and for passenger automobiles to 14,000 pounds. Additionally, the average fuel economy standard clause is removed for conservation purposes. The weight limits for automobiles are increased to 12,000 pounds and for passenger automobiles to 14,000 pounds. The definition of a passenger automobile is clarified to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons. The definition of a passenger automobile is clarified to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in interior length that does not extend beyond the frame of the vehicle. The definition of a passenger automobile is clarified to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in interior length that does not extend beyond the frame of the vehicle and is enclosed by a cap. The amendments apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, amended to raise the dollar amount to $10 annually based on price index adjustments. The dollar amount for penalties under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, is increased annually based on price index adjustments. The Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers is used to calculate the adjustment each year. The amendments made to section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, involve striking certain subparagraphs and redesignating others. These changes will apply to automobiles manufactured after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing and any changes in testing methodology. The biennial report on automobile fuel economy testing must assess accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology, with consultation between the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult on the preparation of the biennial report on automobile fuel economy testing. The first biennial report on testing quality under section 32920 of title 49, United States Code, is due to be submitted to Congress in 2005. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process. The automobile fuel economy testing process aims to provide accurate measures of fuel economy in various driving conditions and compare them with existing ratings. A report is due two years after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of this Act, including determinations and comparisons of automobile fuel economy ratings. An estimate of the average adjustment to fuel economy will also be provided. The Secretary will provide determinations and comparisons of automobile fuel economy ratings, as well as an estimate of the average adjustment needed to conform ratings closely to the most accurate testing process. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy within 180 days of submitting a required report to Congress. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy, to be applied for determining the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. The testing procedure will be based on the process identified in a report as providing the most accurate results. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 based on a revised testing procedure for accurate measurement. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 to reflect improved accuracy in calculating fuel economy using a revised testing procedure. The standards will be at least as stringent as those that would have been applied without the revised procedure. The fuel economy standards for post-2006 automobiles will be amended to be as strict as the original standards, even with the revised testing procedure. Standards for executive agency automobiles are outlined in Section 6. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to establish fleet average fuel economy requirements for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, establishes fleet average fuel economy requirements for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. This includes meeting the average fuel economy standards for the model year. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code establishes fleet average fuel economy requirements for non-passenger and passenger automobiles, including the minimum number of exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles. The President shall prescribe regulations requiring that at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles must meet this requirement. Starting in fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must ensure that at least 10,000 vehicles in their fleet have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard."
