The Congress finds that the United States must maintain its position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Over half of the US economic growth is attributed to research and development in science and technology. The growth of the United States today is directly linked to research and development in science and technology. Fundamental research explores the universe and seeks answers to new questions, while applied research applies these answers to real-world problems. The effectiveness of promoting economic growth in the US depends on intellectual capital and innovation, with education playing a critical role in developing these resources. The United States' economic growth relies on intellectual capital and innovation, with education being crucial in developing these resources. The country needs scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate voters and consumers to drive research, development, and success in a science-based, high-technology workplace. The United States relies on research and development for economic growth, requiring technologically proficient workers and scientifically literate individuals. Student performance in math and science shows shortcomings in K-12 education compared to other countries, emphasizing the need for improved teaching methods in these subjects. The current state of K-12 science and mathematics education in the United States requires new teaching methods, improved curricula, better teacher training, and strong parental involvement. Science education should focus on inquiry, experimentation, and concept-based learning. Science education should be hands-on and focused on the scientific process, starting at an early age and continuing throughout school. Teachers play a crucial role in connecting students with the content they are learning. High-quality teachers should be recruited by offering a respected and rewarding career. Teachers are essential in connecting students with the content they learn. Recruiting high-quality teachers who are knowledgeable in their subject area and up-to-date on teaching techniques is crucial for superior results in education. Incentives and ongoing training are necessary to retain teachers in the classroom and improve their practice.
