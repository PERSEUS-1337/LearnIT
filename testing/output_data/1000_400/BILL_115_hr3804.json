    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\". The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. While land use planning is primarily a State and local responsibility, the Federal Government should support integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development. The Federal Government and State governments should support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into comprehensive land use planning to prevent costly post-disaster recovery efforts. Mitigation strategies from various professional fields should be proactively integrated into urban development. Disaster planning should include mitigation strategies from urban, community, and regional planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and urban design fields. Comprehensive planning is essential for reducing risks posed by natural disasters and terrorist acts. States need to update land use statutes to support safe community planning. Efforts are being made by many States to update land use statutes to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, incorporating long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. State and regional investments need to be coordinated with local plans, requiring additional State-level planning. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, water and wastewater facilities, open space, and critical infrastructure to promote safety and economic viability. Comprehensive urban planning integrates safety considerations and modern techniques for safe housing options in communities, addressing risks posed by prevailing land use patterns. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to enhance housing safety and socioeconomic conditions, including regional impacts on disaster-reduction systems. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards and improve emergency preparedness efforts. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards and improve emergency preparedness efforts. Eligibility for the grant requires submission of an application demonstrating the basic goals of the State or local government regarding land use planning legislation or regulation. To be eligible for a grant under subsection (a), a State or local planning director must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating that their land use planning goals align with guidelines on citizen engagement and multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Land use plans involve multi-jurisdictional cooperation between different government agencies to assess risks posed by natural hazards and terrorist acts. Implementation elements include a timetable for action and defining roles and responsibilities. Regulations are created through cooperation between Federal, State, and local government agencies. Land use plans include implementation elements such as timetables, roles and responsibilities, consistency with budget objectives, and decision frameworks for future infrastructure development. Comprehensive planning encourages risk assessment and mitigation in State or locally incorporated land use plans. The comprehensive planning process includes incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into State or locally adopted land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. It also addresses how these plans will be updated over time to reflect an approach that meets standards. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) shall be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, assessing critical public infrastructure, and mapping for land use and community development policies. The grant funds received by a State or local government can be used for various purposes such as developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation and security plans, assessing public infrastructure, developing geographical information systems, acquiring scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, and implementing CPTED initiatives. (4) Acquiring scenario planning, risk assessment, or vulnerability analysis technology.\n(5) Reviewing and updating building codes, zoning, land use regulations, and State-level enabling legislation.\n(6) Implementing CPTED initiatives.\n(7) Assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use.\n(8) Incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans.\n(9) Integrating regional security plans with transportation or land use plans.\n(10) Encouraging interagency cooperation between first-responders and planning agencies.\n(11) Identifying natural hazard areas for comprehensive plan updates. (d) The maximum grant amount is $1,125,000, with a federal share not exceeding 90% of project funding. Increased federal share may be considered for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations. The federal share of a project funded with a grant shall not exceed 90%, but the Secretary may increase it for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations lacking funds. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits to ensure grant funds are used as specified. Audit results influence future grant awards to States. Definitions for land use planning legislation are provided in this section. In this section, definitions for \"land use planning legislation\" and \"comprehensive plan\" are provided. Land use planning legislation refers to actions taken by governments to guide land use, while a comprehensive plan is a document for regulating land use and development practices. The term \"comprehensive plan\" refers to a planning document adopted for regulating land use, natural resources, development practices, and infrastructure investments at the state level. The term \"comprehensive plan\" refers to a planning document adopted for regulating land use, natural resources, development practices, and infrastructure investments at the state level. The term \"State planning director\" refers to a State official responsible for drafting and updating State guide plans that regulate land use on a statewide basis. The term \"local planning director\" refers to a local official responsible for similar duties at the local level. The responsibility of the local planning director is to draft and update local comprehensive plans that regulate land use and development within the local government's jurisdiction. The term \"Tribal government\" refers to the Tribal government of an Indian Tribe. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on best practices in land use and community planning to reduce threats from natural hazards and terrorism. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, examining the impacts of security strategies on communities, and using mapping and risk-assessment tools. A report to Congress is required within 2 years. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes, software tools for safe development, and design standards for safe planning. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate hazards, terrorism, software tools for safe development, design standards, and best practices for incorporating safety into infrastructure planning. Consideration will be given to regional, State, and local differences in terms of risk-reduction and cost. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023 totaling $57,250,000, with $56,250,000 allocated for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4 implementation."
