Airlines need this insurance for loan agreements, lease agreements, and to comply with foreign countries' requirements. After 9/11, there was a worldwide cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage, leading to increased costs for airlines. The U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. air carriers could still receive coverage. After the 9/11 attacks, airlines faced cancellations of war risk coverage and increased insurance costs. The U.S. government expanded the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to help carriers obtain coverage. Private insurers now offer coverage for passenger and aircraft damage from terrorist attacks, but limited coverage for third-party damage from war or terrorism. Liability and hull risks are typically covered together by insurers. According to a 2012 EU study, private insurance covers loss or damage to passengers and aircraft in terrorist attacks, but third-party damage coverage for war or terrorism is limited. Airlines typically have a single policy covering liability and hull risks. The cost of airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying around $2.3 billion in 2011. Insurance prices vary based on airline location, size, safety record, and other factors. The private market for aviation insurance has limited capacity. The cost of airline insurance is around $60 per flight or $0.80 per passenger, varying based on airline factors. The private market for aviation risk insurance is deemed adequate, but could change in the event of a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage for airlines, with availability and prices for aviation coverage outside of war risk being relatively soft in recent years. A series of airliner losses in 2014 may lead to increases in aviation insurance. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, with ample availability and lower prices. However, a series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to premium increases. Attacks on airports have also contributed to a potentially 50% rise in insurance premiums. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years with lower prices, but a series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to premium increases. Damage to aircraft in recent attacks on airports could result in insurance premiums rising as much as 50%, with war risk insurance premiums potentially tripling. Uncertainty remains on how the commercial market will react, and the availability of private coverage may become prohibitively expensive or even unavailable. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years with lower prices, but a series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to premium increases. Damage to aircraft in recent attacks on airports could result in insurance premiums rising as much as 50%, with war risk insurance premiums potentially tripling. Uncertainty remains on how the commercial market will react, and the availability of private coverage may become prohibitively expensive or even unavailable. The unavailability of private coverage, should it occur, would be especially consequential for U.S. air carriers flying to destinations within the European Union. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates that air carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory must have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. Non-EU carriers overflying EU territory must have insurance against third-party liability, even if their country of registration does not require war risk insurance. This regulation has made war risk insurance mandatory for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires air carriers to have war risk insurance, making it mandatory for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU. The federal government provided war risk insurance to the merchant fleet during World War I and World War II. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance was commercially available but with 48-hour cancellation clauses. A 1951 law gave the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance when necessary for air commerce. The 1951 law amended the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, giving the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance for U.S. and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Coverage included aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and liabilities, with premium rates set by the Secretary of Commerce. A revolving fund was established within the Treasury. The 1951 law amended the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, allowing the Secretary of Commerce to provide war risk insurance for aircraft. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce, and a revolving fund was established within the Treasury to fund the insurance program. The program could be underwritten by any authorized aviation insurance company, and disputes could be settled in federal district court. The program was continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The war risk insurance program for aircraft was established in 1951, allowing any authorized aviation insurance company to underwrite it. Disputes could be settled in federal district court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The era of international terrorism is often traced back to the 1968 hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) initiated international terrorism with the hijacking of a Boeing 707 in Rome, Italy. Subsequent hijackings in 1969 and 1970 led to the Dawson's Field hijackings, where three aircraft were successfully hijacked and destroyed in Jordan. The Dawson's Field hijackings in 1970 involved three aircraft being successfully hijacked and destroyed in Jordan. One of the aircraft, a Pan Am 747, was ordered to fly to Beirut and then Cairo where it was destroyed by an explosive, despite all on board managing to escape. The aircraft was leased and insured. The hijackers redirected the Pan Am 747 to Beirut and Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive, causing the jet to be completely ruined. The incident raised concerns in the insurance industry about insuring Boeing 747s due to their size and passenger capacity. Federal action was taken to maintain war risk insurance coverage in the Middle East after the hijackings at Dawson's Field in 1970. The insurance industry had reservations about insuring Boeing 747s due to their size and passenger capacity. Federal action was taken to maintain war risk insurance coverage in the Middle East after the Dawson Field hijackings. The government offered new insurance at a rate of 20 cents per $100 of insurance, less than what the private market would have charged post-hijackings. This new insurance was part of the existing Aviation War Risk Insurance Program as an emergency response to the Middle East crisis. The new insurance offered at a rate of 20 cents per $100 of insurance was a response to the Middle East crisis and provided coverage for hijacking and terrorist risks. A landmark 1973 federal court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard policy, not its war risk policies, defining \"act of war\" as an operation for military advantage. The court ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not its war risk policies. The definition of \"act of war\" was narrowed to specify that combatants must have significant attributes of sovereignty. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were held liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft. The court ruling held insurers offering \"all risk\" policies liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft. Prior to 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was mainly issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. Premium war risk insurance was only available for specific foreign locations deemed necessary for U.S. foreign policy interests. The FAA issued premium war risk insurance for DOD charter flights to move troops, cargo, and relief supplies overseas. This insurance was only available for specific routes or destinations in conflict areas, last used during the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, airlines began canceling flights to the Middle East due to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates, with premiums increasing significantly for flights to Israel. During Desert Storm, air carriers canceled flights to the Middle East due to high war risk insurance rates. Premiums for flights to Israel increased twentyfold to $125,000 per flight. TWA and Pan Am suspended flights to Israel and other high-risk destinations like Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue flights from Israel under a government war risk policy. FAA did not insure Tower Air's flights to Tel Aviv after Iraqi missile attacks. During Desert Storm, air carriers canceled flights to high-risk destinations like Israel, Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue flights from Israel under a government war risk policy. FAA did not insure Tower Air's flights to Tel Aviv after Iraqi missile attacks. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers canceled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines, leading to increased premiums. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 to address these issues. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-42) was passed in response to the 9/11 attacks, expanding coverage under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism. The program was extended through various acts, with the current authority expiring on September 30, 2014. The scope of policies issued under the federal program was also expanded to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-42) expanded coverage under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism. The program authority expires on September 30, 2014. P.L. 107-296 further expanded the scope of policies to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at specified limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was expanded by P.L. 107-296 to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at specified limits. Rates were set to match commercial rates in force on the date of enactment on November 25, 2002, with a cap on premiums. Coverage would begin with the first dollar of any covered loss incurred. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was expanded by P.L. 107-296 to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at specified limits. Rates were set to match commercial rates in force on the date of enactment on November 25, 2002, with a cap on premiums. Additionally, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA, P.L. 107-297) to create a broader reinsurance program for terrorism losses for most lines of commercial property/casualty insurance. Airlines leaving the FAA program and purchasing commercial insurance may still have terrorism losses covered under TRIA, which has been extended and is set to expire at the end of December 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to U.S. air carriers, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. The program covers 99% of total revenue-passenger-miles flown by U.S. carriers in FY2013, with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion. Premiums are collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, with a balance of $163 million in FY2013. Insurance coverage for U.S. air carriers ranges from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier, with an average coverage of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. The total maximum per occurrence coverage for all insured carriers in January 2014 was $68 billion. Premiums are collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, which had a balance of approximately $2.2 billion as of July 31, 2014. 17 U.S. air carriers cancelled their FAA war risk insurance policies between April 2014 and August 2014. Currently, the FAA insures 27 air carriers, covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. The total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force is $31 billion. The FAA currently insures 27 air carriers, covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. Coverage ranges from $100 million to $3 billion per carrier occurrence, with an average of $1.1 billion. The total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Premium collections for FY2015 are estimated to be $18 million, assuming Congress extends the existing program through FY2015. The FAA reduced its estimated collection from $167 million to $125 million in August 2014. Premium collections for FY2015 are projected to be $18 million if the existing program is extended by Congress. The coverage includes hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability without deductibles or coinsurance. The definition of \"war risk occurrence\" encompasses various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The FAA's policy document outlines various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks, including war between Great Powers, invasion, civil war, acts of foreign enemies, strikes, riots, labor disturbances, and malicious acts for political or terrorist purposes. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered under this policy. Any malicious acts, sabotage, vandalism, or intentional damage are not covered under this policy. Additionally, confiscation, nationalization, seizure, or appropriation by foreign governments are excluded. Hijacking or unlawful seizure is also not covered. The policy does not cover government seizures due to legal debts, taxes, fines, or unlawful acts. It excludes hijacking, unlawful seizure, and detonation of weapons on the aircraft. Premiums charged by the FAA are based on the risk assumed by the program. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program covers the discharge or detonation of weapons on an aircraft. Premiums are based on the risk assumed by the program, with a cap set at twice the premium paid by air carriers to the Department of Transportation. The program has a small administrative staff and has paid over $10 million in compensation since the 9/11 attacks. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program has a small administrative staff and has paid over $10 million in compensation since the 9/11 attacks. Claims were filed for specific incidents, including an attempted bombing in 2009 and an aircraft seizure in 2012. Total claims paid to date amount to $205,600. In July 2012, an unattended SkyWest aircraft was seized by a fugitive airline employee who caused damage to airport facilities and personal vehicles before taking his own life. Total claims paid for this incident amount to $9.6 million. In April 2014, FAA paid $256,890 for repairs to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft damaged by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed aviation reform to Congress in March 2014. In March 2014, the Secretary of Transportation proposed aviation reform to Congress, including a legislative proposal to reform the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. This proposal would permanently authorize the program with a reduced overall scope, providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in the event of a widespread cancellation of coverage by the private insurance market. The proposal aims to provide aviation war risk coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical, and/or radioactive (NBCR) weapons, as well as full coverage for 90 days in case of widespread cancellation by private insurers. This proposal is part of ongoing efforts to reform the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, with previous proposals seeking collaboration with commercial insurers for shared-risk coverage. The President's FY2014 budget proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, aiming for collaboration with commercial insurers to establish a shared-risk model. Commercial insurers would take on 20% of the war risk market annually from FY2015 to FY2018, reducing FAA's share to 20% by FY2018. Previous budgets suggested a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures. The airline industry has been hesitant about changes to the program due to concerns about cost. The FY2014 budget proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, including a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures. Airlines for America opposed the changes, stating they could cost airlines hundreds of millions of dollars and lead to service reductions. They recommended maintaining the program as is and extending it for three years. A4A opposed proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, citing potential cost increases and service reductions. They recommended maintaining the program as is and extending it for three years. The Secretary of Transportation's proposal argued against the extension due to budgetary concerns. The current Administration proposal to extend the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program is not considered prudent due to budgetary concerns, with a projected cost of over $1 billion over 10 years. Two approaches to reduce budgetary costs include increasing premiums or seeking higher returns on funds, and reducing assumed risk to lower eventual payouts. Premiums collected by FAA totaled $165 million in FY2013, with the maximum amount largely set by statute. Raising the statutory cap could potentially increase funds. The FAA collected $165 million in premiums in FY2013, with the maximum amount set by statute. Increasing the statutory cap could raise premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies. Airlines with low risk profiles might seek private insurance or operate with less coverage if premiums increase. Premiums received by insurers are typically invested until needed. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical lows. Private insurers invest in a wider range of instruments with higher historical returns. Total net investment income and realized gains are significant. Private insurers invest in a wide range of instruments with higher historical returns compared to U.S. Treasury securities. In 2013, private property/casualty insurers earned approximately $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in cash and investments. If the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund had similar returns, it could have earned around $91 million instead of $26 million in interest on its $2 billion holding of federal securities in FY2013. Private insurance policies are riskier and typically do not cover the full amount of potential losses, leaving the insured to bear some of the risk through deductibles, co-insurance, and maximums. Private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities, as they do not cover the full amount of potential losses. Risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance discourage behavior changes that may lead to losses, known as \"moral hazard.\" Since 2002, the government has offered coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance, ensuring full coverage up to maximum limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers losses that may not be covered by private insurers. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance since 2002, ensuring full coverage up to maximum limits. It also covers losses not typically considered \"war risks,\" such as vandalism or labor disturbances. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers to spread risk and achieve significant savings. Private insurers often share risks among two or more insurers, using reinsurance to spread risk and achieve significant savings. Loss sharing in insurance contracts can be tailored to achieve desired risk-sharing forms. Loss sharing in insurance contracts can be tailored to achieve desired risk-sharing forms, allowing companies to draw on their particular strengths more effectively. Private insurers enter into reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements not only to share financial risk but also to benefit from each party's expertise or capacity in insurance operations. For example, one insurer may excel in judging risks and underwriting policies but lack sufficient financial capital, while another insurer may have high capital levels but lack the same expertise. A well-constructed loss-sharing arrangement could benefit both insurers. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a loss-sharing program where insurers with expertise but limited capital can benefit from those with high capital but lacking expertise. The program kicks in when losses reach 20% of premiums, with the government covering 85%. The minimum losses for government coverage have increased over time, reducing the government's share of future losses. Initially intended to expire quickly, the program has continued. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a loss-sharing program where insurers benefit from government coverage when losses reach a certain level. The program was initially intended to expire quickly but has since been reauthorized with a gradual decrease in government share of losses. Improved international guidance for risk decisions in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance. Interest has grown in disseminating threat information for civilian flight operations in high-risk regions after the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17. Insurance underwriters are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in conflict zones due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. Airlines have been overflying certain high-risk regions until formal restrictions were imposed in August 2014. Insurance underwriters are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in conflict zones due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. Insurers have raised concerns about airlines overflying certain high-risk regions until formal restrictions were imposed in August 2014. Airlines fly over conflict zones to minimize costs unless expressly restricted, a practice questioned after the Malaysia Airlines crash. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convened a task force in August 2014 to assess conflict zone risks more collaboratively. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formed a task force to address inconsistent risk assessment in conflict zones for civilian aircraft. Countries are supposed to identify conflict areas, assess risks, and establish safety measures, but not all countries share this information or take necessary precautions. This lack of cooperation could impact travel and tourism. Aviation authorities like the FAA may issue warnings or restrict flights to mitigate risks. Aviation authorities, like the FAA, may issue warnings or restrict flights in conflict zones to protect civil aviation. However, conflicting views on risk and precautions among regulators, airlines, and insurers can lead to inconsistent practices. For example, in July 2014, FAA imposed restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict, prompting international airlines to suspend service as well. In July 2014, FAA imposed restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict, leading to international airlines suspending service. Israeli authorities later asked carriers to resume flights, highlighting the challenges of disseminating warnings in conflict zones. Improved processes for assessing hazards and issuing warnings could address concerns over aviation safety. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation, issuing warnings, and restricting flights could address concerns over private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage by potentially reducing uncertainties and ambiguities in assessing risk. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. Minimum insurance coverage is mandated to ensure liability protection. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates insurance for air carriers and aircraft operators for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. Minimum coverage requirements are set at 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger for passenger liability, higher than the Montreal Convention's 113,100 SDRs ($171,259) per passenger. Non-commercial aircraft with a MTOM of 2,700 kg have a lower minimum of 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger, and cargo liability needs 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram in commercial operations. Article 7 of EU Regulation 785/2004 outlines insurance requirements for third-party liability in aviation. The minimum coverage per accident varies based on the aircraft's maximum take-off mass (MTOM), ranging from 750,000 SDRs ($1,135,568) for smaller aircraft to 700 million SDRs (nearly $1.06 billion) for larger aircraft. Sanctions for non-compliance with the regulation are meant to be effective, proportional, and dissuasive, potentially including the withdrawal of operating licenses for EU air carriers. The EU Regulation 785/2004 outlines insurance requirements for aviation based on aircraft's MTOM, with coverage ranging from 750,000 SDRs for smaller aircraft to 700 million SDRs for larger ones. Sanctions for non-compliance are meant to be effective and may include license withdrawal. The federal government also provides insurance programs, such as the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, created after 9/11, provides federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when private insurance is unavailable or expensive. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was created after 9/11 to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when private insurance is unavailable or expensive. The program was initially authorized for three years, but has been reauthorized multiple times due to the insurance industry's unwillingness to cover terrorism risk. Several bills have been introduced to further extend the program, with support from the insurance industry and others. TRIA and the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program share a common genesis but have different workings. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was created after 9/11 to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when private insurance is unavailable or expensive. Several bills have been introduced to extend the program, with support from the insurance industry. Unlike the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, TRIA does not provide coverage directly to businesses at risk of terrorism losses but offers government reinsurance for private insurers. Insurers must offer terrorism coverage and would cover any losses, with the government reimbursing them for some of their losses. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provides federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when private insurance is unavailable or expensive. Private insurers are required to offer terrorism coverage and would cover any losses, with the government reimbursing them for some of their losses. TRIA coverage is more limited than federal aviation war risk insurance and operates through private insurers. There are no upfront premiums, but a post-event recoupment fee may be applied to recover the government's costs. Losses covered under TRIA would be paid from the government's general fund. TRIA coverage is limited and operates through private insurers. Losses must reach $100 million from a terrorist act before federal funds flow. Acts certified for this threshold are narrower than those triggering federal aviation war risk insurance. No federal limits on costs. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act before federal funds are available. The acts certified for this threshold are narrower than those triggering federal aviation war risk insurance. Private insurers must offer terrorism coverage under the same terms as other causes of loss, but may charge a separate premium. Terrorism premiums may be limited under state insurance laws."
