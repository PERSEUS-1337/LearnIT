The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially in unstable regions. The United Nations has recognized the threat of weapons of mass destruction and has taken steps to prevent proliferation. The United Nations recognizes the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation and has established measures to prevent it. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are also pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the likelihood of nuclear weapons use in the future. Concerns have been raised about Russia's ability to secure its nuclear materials and weapons due to deteriorating conditions at nuclear sites and bases. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the 1990s. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports from western countries. In October 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement to exchange nuclear technology. Brazil and Argentina also had substantial nuclear programs. North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons raises concerns about proliferation, while Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa have renounced nuclear weapons and accepted safeguards. The United States' security interests align with South Korea's policies. The United States supports various nuclear weapons free zones, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA plays a crucial role in countering proliferation through its Strengthened Safeguards System program. The United States signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty in 1996. The IAEA's safeguard system may be affected by constraints, and the US supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors. Storage and disposal challenges arise from dismantled nuclear warheads' plutonium, which could be converted into nuclear warhead fuel if misused. The United States supports using plutonium as an energy source and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors. However, challenges arise from storing and disposing of plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads, which could potentially be converted into nuclear warhead fuel. Additional steps should be taken to strengthen the international nuclear nonproliferation regime. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It aims to establish more effective controls over the transfer of nuclear materials and technology to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote nonproliferation policies. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION POLICY. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads with Russia, and negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by signing treaties, reaching agreements with Russia to end new warhead production, negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals, and enforcing multilateral agreements to decrease nuclear arsenals globally. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by signing treaties and reaching agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty member states to halt the production of weapons-usable fissile materials and strengthen IAEA safeguards for compliance. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by signing treaties and agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty member states to halt the production of weapons-usable fissile materials. Additionally, efforts are being made to strengthen IAEA safeguards, enhance nuclear and dual-use export controls, impose sanctions on violators, and provide increased public information on nuclear export licenses. The United States and other nuclear supplier nations impose sanctions on individuals, companies, and countries contributing to nuclear proliferation. They also aim to reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons by reducing regional tensions and strengthening security agreements. Additionally, they seek to increase the role of the United Nations Security Council in enforcing international nonproliferation agreements and adopt a policy of \"no first use\" with other nuclear weapon states. The curr_chunk encourages the United Nations Security Council to increase its role in enforcing international nuclear nonproliferation agreements. It also suggests concluding agreements with other nuclear weapon states, including adopting a policy of \"no first use\" and dismantling tactical nuclear weapons. Additionally, it recommends ratifying specific nuclear-free zone treaties and monitoring North Korea's activities. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need to ratify specific nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's activities, and begin negotiations on START III between the United States and the Russian Federation. The President must report to Congress every February on actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries. Reports must be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. The Act defines key terms such as \"fissile materials,\" \"highly enriched uranium,\" \"IAEA,\" \"IAEA safeguards,\" \"no first use,\" \"non-nuclear weapon state,\" and \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to nuclear weapons, including \"non-nuclear weapon state,\" \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" and \"START I treaty.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to nuclear weapons treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, START I treaty, START II treaty, and START III treaty."
