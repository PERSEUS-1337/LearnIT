Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in approximately 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at genetic risk. There is no effective treatment to slow the disease's progression, which manifests in loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms between ages 30-50, while late-onset occurs after 50 with milder symptoms. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those not yet adults. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes like personality shifts, irritability, and depression. Late-onset Huntington's Disease occurs after 50 years of age with milder symptoms, while Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects individuals under 19 years old and progresses rapidly.
