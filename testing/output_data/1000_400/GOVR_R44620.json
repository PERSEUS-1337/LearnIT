    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a preparation made from living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, cells, or tissues. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their reference brand-name drugs. A generic drug is chemically identical to its reference brand-name drug, while biologics are more complex and made from living organisms. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs, with biosimilars like Inflectra being approved as alternatives to brand-name biologics. The drug Remicade, containing thousands of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, has a biosimilar called Inflectra approved by the FDA in 2016. The FDA regulates biologics and chemical drugs through different centers, with CBER overseeing traditional biologics and CDER handling prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics. See Appendix A for more details. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics, including monoclonal antibodies and cytokines used to treat various diseases. Biologics include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and immunomodulators used to treat diseases like cancer, infections, and autoimmune conditions. Biologics and biosimilars, including enzyme inhibitors and immunomodulators, require special handling and are often referred to as specialty drugs due to their administration via injection or infusion. Specialty drugs are expensive and may need specialized facilities for dispensing. Biologics, also known as specialty drugs, are expensive medications that are often administered through injection or infusion. The cost of some biologic medications can exceed $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase over the previous year. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, showing a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics subject to biosimilar competition accounted for $3.2 billion, with $2.9 billion spent on original biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011, driving up Medicare Part B program costs significantly. Spending on biologics in the Medicare Part B program has been increasing significantly, with biologics accounting for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologic drugs are more expensive in the United States compared to Europe and Canada, where the introduction of biosimilars has led to price reductions of up to 33%. Congress has made efforts to lower drug prices, including passing the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 and a similar approach in 2010 for biologics. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, leading to a 61% price reduction in Portugal. Generic medications decrease prices by 60% to 90% on branded oral-solid medications, helping the U.S. generic drug industry expand and lower costs for consumers. The generic drug industry achieves cost savings by avoiding the expense of clinical trials and initial research and development costs. Before marketing approval, generic companies must demonstrate to the FDA that their product is identical to the original. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with brand-name drugs and other generics using the same reference product. Manufacturing standards and reporting requirements must be met by the generic drug sponsor. The FDA allows generic drugs to rely on previous findings of safety and effectiveness for approved drugs. Generic drugs must meet manufacturing standards and reporting requirements. The biotechnology industry developed its first biologics for human therapeutic use in the 1980s, including human insulin, growth hormone, interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. These biological products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application. The biotechnology industry developed the first human drug, human insulin, in the 1980s, followed by growth hormone, interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. Biological products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application. After the development of human insulin in the 1980s, the biotechnology industry created various biological products like growth hormone and erythropoietin. These products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not provide a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA, leading to limitations in submitting applications for therapeutic biologics licensed under the PHSA. In 1941, Congress gave the FDA authority over the marketing of insulin, a small protein that regulates sugar metabolism. Despite being similar to other biologics, insulin was regulated as a drug rather than a biologic. This also applied to a few other natural source biological products like glucagon and human growth hormone. Insulin and a few other natural source biological products were regulated as drugs by the FDA rather than as biologics by the NIH. This included glucagon, human growth hormone, hormones for infertility, menopause, osteoporosis, and certain medical enzymes. FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars, hindering market competition for specialty biologic drug products. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars, hindering market competition for specialty biologic drug products. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system for biosimilars, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a petition that could inhibit biosimilar approvals. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers for marketing biosimilars, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing several biosimilar products. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency authorized the marketing of biosimilar products with fewer barriers. The first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, was approved in April 2006, followed by several others in subsequent years. In the United States, FDA approval of Omnitrope was granted in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of the sponsor, Sandoz, who alleged FDA delays in processing the application. The court ruled in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor of Omnitrope, stating that the FDA must consider the application submitted in 2003. The approval of Omnitrope in 2006 through the 505(b)(2) pathway created by the Hatch-Waxman Act did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress later established new regulatory authority for the FDA in March 2010. The FDA established a new regulatory authority in March 2010 for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009. Congress must change the law before the FDA can approve copies of other biotech products. The FDA gained authority through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, part of the Affordable Care Act. Congress allowed FDA to collect user fees from industry. The terms biosimilar and interchangeable are defined under the BPCIA. A biological product can be deemed \"biosimilar\" if it is highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. To be considered interchangeable, a sponsor must show the biosimilar product produces the same clinical result as the reference. The FDA requires a biosimilar product to be highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. To be considered interchangeable, the sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient, with no greater risk in alternating or switching between the two. Interchangeable products can be substituted by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. The FDA has released guidance documents on biosimilars, allowing interchangeable products to be substituted without the prescribing healthcare provider's intervention. Public meetings were held to gather feedback before final guidance was released in 2015. Additional guidance on various biosimilar topics is also available on the FDA's website. The FDA released final guidance on biosimilars in 2015, requiring companies to submit applications demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The agency may waive certain studies at its discretion. Any changes to the approved manufacturing process must be reported. The FDA requires companies to submit applications for biosimilars with analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The agency may waive certain studies if deemed unnecessary. Changes to the manufacturing process must demonstrate comparability to maintain product quality and safety. Brand-name biologics like Remicade underwent multiple manufacturing changes with each requiring a comparability demonstration. FDA and the drug industry deal with the variability in biological products from natural sources. The FDA requires companies to submit applications for biosimilars with analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Brand-name biologics like Remicade underwent multiple manufacturing changes, each requiring a comparability demonstration. FDA approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the United States, but sales of five have been delayed by brand-name manufacturers. Patent infringement lawsuits have delayed the marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars. Pfizer has FDA approval to market biosimilar Inflectra. The marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has FDA approval to market biosimilar Inflectra but has sued Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using anticompetitive tactics. These actions have negatively impacted the sales of other recently approved biosimilars. The FDA approved seven biosimilars between March 2015 and October 2017, with high costs of biologics leading to increased interest in the government's role in new therapeutics development. Brand-name drugs were discovered by public-sector research institutions, including Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, and Avastin. Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) was the first biosimilar approved in March 2015. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen discovered by scientists at Sloan Kettering. FDA also approved Inflectra in April 2016, a biosimilar to Remicade made by Janssen Biotech, Inc. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, marketed by Pfizer at a lower price. Remicade is a top-selling drug globally. Pfizer marketed the biosimilar Inflectra in the United States at a lower price than Remicade, a top-selling drug. In September 2017, Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts with health insurers. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts with health insurers, blocking coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. J&J's rebate trap incentivizes insurers to prefer Remicade over biosimilars. The biosimilar manufacturer faces challenges in competing with branded biologics due to the rebate trap, where the branded manufacturer can withdraw rebates, increasing costs for payers. Even with a 60% price difference, if only 50% of patients switch to the biosimilar, payer costs may still increase. Strategies to reduce biologic spending through biosimilar adoption must navigate this rebate trap. The rebate trap can increase payer costs if only 50% of patients switch to the biosimilar, requiring a near-complete switch to avoid this. Pfizer's lawsuit highlights providers declining to purchase Inflectra, even for covered patients. According to Pfizer's lawsuit, most healthcare providers have not purchased Inflectra, a biosimilar to infliximab, despite insurance coverage. Inflectra has only secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US since its FDA approval in April 2016. J&J, the maker of Remicade, has raised prices and government reimbursements, potentially hindering competition. Inflectra has secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US since FDA approval in April 2016. J&J, the maker of Remicade, has raised prices and government reimbursements, potentially hindering competition. Pfizer states in a lawsuit that J&J's anticompetitive practices could set a precedent for biologic originator firms to maintain dominance against biosimilar competition. J&J's president of Janssen Biotech, Scott White, claims they are competing on value and price, with competition expected to lower overall costs in the future. In response to the Pfizer lawsuit, J&J's Scott White stated they are competing on value and price, with competition expected to lower overall costs. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, which is biosimilar to Enbrel. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs in the world. Enbrel (etanercept) is manufactured by Amgen and was originally discovered by scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital. Immunex received a license from the FDA to market Enbrel in 1998, and was later acquired by Amgen in 2002. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs globally and in the United States. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, has been approved for all indications included on the label for Enbrel. Clinical studies have confirmed that Erelzi is highly similar to the US-licensed reference product. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, has been approved for all indications included on the label for Enbrel. Clinical studies confirmed Erelzi's similarity to the reference product. A release date for marketing of Erelzi is pending due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and Novartis. FDA approved another biosimilar, Amjevita, which is similar to Humira. In April 2018, a trial is scheduled for Novartis' biosimilar, Amjevita, which is similar to Humira. Amjevita was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Due to patent litigation, Amjevita may not be available commercially until 2018. FDA also approved another biosimilar, Renflexis, in April 2017. Humira (adalimumab) is a top-selling drug globally and in the US. Amjevita, a biosimilar, may not be available until 2018 due to patent litigation. Renflexis, another biosimilar, was approved by the FDA in April 2017. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the US at a price 35% below Remicade. In 1998, FDA licensed infliximab to Centocor Inc., now Janssen Biotech Inc. Remicade is a top-selling drug globally. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the US at a 35% lower price than Remicade. FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, in August 2017. Abbott Laboratories was licensed to market Humira in 2002. Cyltezo is a biosimilar to Humira, a top-selling drug originally discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement, delaying the launch date of Cyltezo. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, in September 2017. Avastin is also a top-selling drug in the United States. FDA approved Mvasi (bevacizumab-awwb), a biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab) by Amgen, which is a top-selling drug in the United States. The Purple Book lists licensed biological products, including biosimilars, and provides information on the proprietary names of drug products. The Purple Book lists biological products, including biosimilars, licensed by FDA under the PHS Act, along with the date of licensure. Appendix D provides examples of proprietary and nonproprietary names for CDER and CBER licensed biological products. FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2015, finalized in 2017, outlining naming conventions for biosimilars. The FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2015, finalized in 2017. The guidance outlines the naming convention for biosimilars, using a proper name that combines a core name with a distinguishing suffix devoid of meaning. An example is filgrastim-xzwy. The FDA continues to consider the appropriate suffix for each biological product. The FDA guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products includes using a proper name that combines a core name with a unique suffix devoid of meaning, such as filgrastim-xzwy. For originator biological products, the FDA intends to use a core name adopted by the USAN Council, while in Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the same International Nonproprietary Name (INN) selected by the WHO. The USAN Council selects names based on safety, consistency, and logic. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the same INN selected by the WHO. The WHO released the Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal in 2016 to uniquely identify biological substances. The BQ is a code with four random consonants used for prescription and dispensing of medicines. The Biological Qualifier (BQ) is a code with four random consonants used to uniquely identify biological substances for prescription and dispensing of medicines. The naming scheme for biosimilars is a point of contention between biosimilar industry groups and innovator companies, with concerns raised by the Federal Trade Commission about potential misperceptions that could hinder the development of biosimilar markets and competition. The FDA's naming proposal could deter physicians from prescribing biosimilars, impeding market development and competition. Historically, all originator biologics with the same nonproprietary name signal pharmacological and chemical relationship similarities. The FDA's proposal will use the same USAN for biosimilars and their reference biologics. The FDA's proposal to use the same nonproprietary name for biosimilars and their reference biologics may lead to misconceptions about their differences. This could impact physician prescribing habits and hinder market competition for biosimilars. The FDA's proposal to use the same nonproprietary name for biosimilars and their reference biologics may lead to misconceptions about their differences, contributing to misperceptions about biosimilars. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is misused to instill fear and misunderstanding. Biosimilars are not required to be identical to their reference biologics, as variability is inherent in biologics. FDA's labeling rules for prescription drug products provide information on safety and effectiveness for healthcare providers to make informed decisions. The FDA's labeling rules for prescription drug products convey safety and effectiveness information to healthcare providers for informed decision-making. The labeling, approved by the FDA, is based on a thorough analysis of the new drug application or biologics license application submitted by the applicant. It contains essential information for safe and effective use, written for healthcare practitioners. The FDA requires labeling for prescription drugs to provide essential information for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. This includes warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and patient counseling information. FDA also released draft guidance on biosimilar labeling. The FDA released draft guidance on biosimilar labeling in March 2016, recommending a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The biosimilar product may not have the same labeling as the reference product, and comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity should not be included in the labeling to avoid confusion. The FDA recommends a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in biosimilar product labeling, which may differ from the reference product. Comparative data should not be included in the labeling to prevent confusion. Views on FDA labeling guidance vary, with the generic industry preferring less information and the brand-name industry wanting more. The FDA is requiring more information in biosimilar product labeling, with the Generic Pharmaceutical Association arguing that the Biosimilarity Statement is unnecessary and confusing, while BIO believes more information is preferable for prescribers. The BPCIA provision will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. The BPCIA provision will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. FDA released draft guidance regarding the agency's interpretation of this provision in March 2016, emphasizing the need for transparent labeling to distinguish between biosimilar and reference products. The FDA released draft guidance in March 2016 on the BPCIA provision, stating that a biological product must be submitted under the PHS Act, with exceptions until March 23, 2020. Applications can be submitted under the FD&C Act if a similar product was approved before March 23, 2010, but not if there is a reference product approved under the PHS Act. The FDA guidance states that a biological product approved under the FD&C Act before March 23, 2010, can be submitted under the PHS Act, but not if there is a reference product approved under the PHS Act. Any biological product approved under the FD&C Act will be deemed a license under the PHS Act on March 23, 2020. Applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after this date and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA. FDA will not approve any pending applications for biological products subject to the transition provisions after March 23, 2020. FDA's interpretation as of March 23, 2020, states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA. FDA will not approve any pending applications for biological products subject to transition provisions after this date. Industry representatives have raised concerns about potential delays in the review and approval of competing biological products. The FDA's proposed policy may delay the approval of competing biological products. Industry groups are concerned about the impact of the FDA's interpretation on exclusivity rights for biological products. Orphan drug exclusivity will still apply after March 23, 2020, but other types of exclusivity may cease to have effect. Orphan drug exclusivity can block drug approval under certain acts. Industry groups have legal concerns about FDA's exclusivity policy. Transitional biological products won't have 12-year exclusivity. FDA aims to prevent exclusivity that hinders competition until 2032. The BPCI Act does not grant exclusivity to biological products approved under the FD&C Act, which could impede biosimilar competition until 2032. Interchangeable products can produce the same clinical result as the reference product and may be substituted without the prescribing health care provider's intervention. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability of biosimilar products in January 2017, allowing pharmacists to substitute interchangeable products without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. This process is separate from generic drug substitution, as biosimilars are not structurally identical to their reference biologics. The comment period for the interchangeability guidance was extended to May 19, 2017. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability of biosimilar products in January 2017, allowing pharmacists to substitute interchangeable products without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. The comment period for the interchangeability guidance was extended to May 19, 2017. In Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization purposes but does not make determinations on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability of biosimilar medicines. Some countries, like Denmark, consider all originators and biosimilars interchangeable unless proven otherwise, while Ireland allows a single switch but not multiple switches. In the United States, the FDA regulates the drug product, while states regulate pharmacies. At least 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution standards. At least 37 states have legislation on biosimilar substitution standards, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The agreement included performance goals and the use of fees solely for new product review activities. In 1992, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), allowing FDA to negotiate performance goals with industry and use fees for new product review activities. User fees now make up 43% of the FDA budget, and similar authority has been added for medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allows FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorizes FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews, including fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and facilitate early meetings with FDA. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allows FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews, including fees for products in the development phase. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program assists industry sponsors in early stages of developing biosimilar products. As of February 2017, there were 64 BPD programs for 23 reference products. Companies can choose to discontinue participation but would need to pay a reactivation fee. Small businesses may have the biosimilar biological product application fee waived for their first application. FY2017 fee rates under BsUFA I are detailed in Table 4. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allows FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews, including products in development. Companies can discontinue participation but must pay a reactivation fee. Small businesses may have the application fee waived for their first application. FY2017 fee rates under BsUFA I are detailed in Table 4. FDA held a public meeting on the reauthorization of the program\u2014BsUFA II\u2014in December 2015 and posted the draft agreement for FY2018 through FY2022 in September 2016. The FDA held public meetings and negotiation sessions for the reauthorization of the biosimilar user fee program, BsUFA II, from 2015 to 2016. The draft agreement for FY2018 through FY2022 was posted on the FDA website in September 2016. Congress reauthorized the program via the FDARA in 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals due to a lack of staff. The FDARA, signed into law in 2017, aims to address FDA challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals by enhancing staff capacity through new hiring authorities provided by the 21st Century Cures Act. These enhancements include modernizing the hiring system, utilizing expert contractors, setting clear hiring goals, and conducting continuous assessments to improve hiring and retention practices. Under BsUFA II, the FDA has made enhancements to meet performance goals, save time and resources for applicants, encourage price competition, and lower healthcare costs. Changes include dropping the supplement and establishment fees, retaining BPD fees, renaming the product fee to BsUFA Program fee, and limiting sponsors to five BsUFA Program fees per fiscal year per application. The application fee will no longer be reduced by cumulative BPD fees paid. FDA and industry estimate positive outcomes from these changes. The BsUFA II program has made changes to fees, including retaining BPD fees and renaming the product fee to BsUFA Program fee. Sponsors are now limited to five BsUFA Program fees per fiscal year per application, and the application fee will no longer be reduced by cumulative BPD fees paid. FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover BsUFA program costs. The federal government and pharmaceutical industry have different focuses in research funding, with the former on basic research and the latter on clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, as both basic and applied research play a role. Concerns over high drug costs have led to scrutiny of the federal role in developing new therapeutics. Studies have attempted to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery, with one study finding that 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from sources other than the pharmaceutical industry. The federal government and pharmaceutical industry have different focuses in research funding, with the former on basic research and the latter on clinical trials. Concerns over high drug costs have led to scrutiny of the federal role in developing new therapeutics. Studies have attempted to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery, with one study finding that 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from sources other than the pharmaceutical industry. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from non-industry sources. Between 1990 and 2007, 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA resulted from publicly funded research, with 19% of priority review applications coming from this source. Publicly funded labs have contributed significantly to new drug development. Between 1990 and 2007, 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs resulted from publicly funded research, with 19% of priority review applications coming from this source. Publicly funded labs have made significant contributions to new drug development, with a higher percentage of priority reviews for drugs discovered in public-sector research institutions compared to private-sector research. The 2011 Stevens study found that publicly funded research institutions have contributed significantly to the discovery of new drugs, with a higher percentage of priority review applications coming from this source. The study excluded the role of these institutions in developing platform technologies that have led to the creation of new drug classes. The Stevens study excluded the role of publicly funded research institutions in developing platform technologies that enabled the creation of new drug classes, despite their significant contribution to the discovery of new drugs. Key platform technologies excluded from the study include recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods for recombinant DNA, production methods for antibodies, methods to produce glycosylated recombinant proteins, and gene silencing methods using small interfering RNAs. The study excluded platform technologies developed by PSRI scientists, such as methods for glycosylated recombinant proteins and gene silencing with small interfering RNAs. These technologies played a crucial role in the development of FDA-approved products, including 36 biologic drugs discovered by PSRIs in the past 40 years. Regulatory oversight for biological products falls under the Public Health Service Act. The pharmaceutical industry outlook is discussed, with 36 biologic drugs discovered by PSRIs in the past 40 years. Biologics are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 marked the beginning of federal regulation for biologics. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes in response to contamination incidents. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 focused on premarket approval and manufacturing processes for biological products in response to contamination incidents, predating the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. It required facilities to be inspected before a federal license was issued. The Pure Food and Drugs Act did not have premarket control over new drugs, unlike the later-enacted Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application (NDA) before marketing. The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 did not have premarket control over new drugs, unlike the later-enacted Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938. The FFDCA required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application (NDA) before marketing. The Public Health Service Act revised the Biologics Control Act in 1944, specifying that biological products licensed under the PHSA are also subject to regulation under the FFDCA. The 1944 Public Health Service Act specified that biological products licensed under the PHSA are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Biological products include viruses, vaccines, blood products, and similar items used for disease prevention or treatment. The FFDCA applies to biological products regulated under the PHSA, with exceptions for products with approved licenses. The PHSA, amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, requires a single BLA for biological products. It also provides authority to suspend a license immediately in case of public health danger. The PHSA, amended by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, requires a single biological license application (BLA) for biological products. It also allows for the suspension of a license in case of public health danger. The BPCIA created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products and established regulatory exclusivity periods for certain brand-name biologics and biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established a pathway for biosimilar products and regulatory exclusivity periods for brand-name biologics and biosimilars. Regulatory responsibility for biologics has evolved from the Hygienic Laboratory to the FDA, with the creation of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In 1982, the FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics split into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER moved to the new FDA headquarters in October 2014. Determining jurisdictional status for biotechnology products has been challenging. FDA published an Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDER in 1991. In 1991, FDA established an Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDER to regulate traditional biologics and biotechnology products. FDA later reorganized review responsibilities in 2002, consolidating new pharmaceutical products under CDER and allowing CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. In 2002, the FDA reorganized review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. CDER now regulates licensed biologics like monoclonal antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines, while CBER focuses on traditional biologics such as vaccines and blood products. In 2002, the FDA reorganized review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. CDER now regulates monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines, while CBER focuses on traditional biologics like vaccines and blood products."
