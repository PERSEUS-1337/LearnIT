    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with higher scrutiny for more suspect classifications. This increases the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. The government's classification is subject to different levels of scrutiny based on its suspect nature or potential discrimination. Courts use strict scrutiny for classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review. Governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect are subject to strict scrutiny, which considers historical discrimination, minority status with unchangeable characteristics, and inadequate political protection. Suspect classifications include those based on race, national origin, and alienage. Strict scrutiny requires the government to prove that its actions are narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest and cannot be achieved through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny is a less rigorous standard. When reviewing governmental action, courts apply strict scrutiny to determine if it is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny, showing that less discriminatory means are not available. Intermediate scrutiny, applied to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender, assesses if the action is substantially related to an important government interest. The government bears the burden of proving the constitutional validity under intermediate scrutiny as well. Rational basis review is the least rigorous form of judicial review. When applying intermediate scrutiny, courts assess if governmental action is substantially related to an important government interest. The government must establish the constitutional validity of its actions under this level of scrutiny. Rational basis review, the least rigorous form of scrutiny, requires that governmental action be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and it only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose. When evaluating governmental action under rational basis review, courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action. The action needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose to survive this review, which is deferential to the government. Parties challenging governmental actions bear the burden of establishing their invalidity under rational basis review. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained within the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees, found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, prevent the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following certain procedural and substantive requirements. The Fifth Amendment applies to federal government actions, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state actions. The Constitution's due process language prohibits the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following procedural and substantive requirements. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights from undue governmental infringement, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. Fundamental rights are determined by historical recognition and their importance to liberty and justice. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions that infringe upon fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must demonstrate a substantial need for its actions to further a compelling interest without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. If alternative actions could have been less burdensome on rights while achieving the same goal, the government's action is not considered narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court recognizes fundamental rights, including the right to have children, use contraception, and marry. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court ruled state same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process guarantees. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges established that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages formed in other states based on due process and equal protection principles. The Court emphasized the fundamental right to marry, which it has long held as constitutionally protected. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order without distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order without distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights, stating that rights should not be limited by historical practices to allow new groups to exercise fundamental rights. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order without distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The Court found that rights do not solely come from ancient sources but also from a better understanding of constitutional imperatives. It determined that the fundamental right to marry includes the right of same-sex couples to marry and did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order. It did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from precedent and not addressing whether the bans were narrowly tailored to the states' justifications. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order. It did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from precedent and not addressing whether the bans were narrowly tailored to the states' justifications. The Court held that both equal protection and due process guarantees protect the fundamental right to marry, and that states can no longer deny this right to same-sex couples. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order. The Court did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny. Dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the majority overstepped by removing the issue of same-sex marriage from the democratic process. They also expressed concern about the majority establishing a fundamental right contrary to Supreme Court precedent. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell disagreed with the majority's decision to resolve the issue of same-sex marriage for the entire country, believing it should have been left to the people. They also criticized the majority for establishing a fundamental right contrary to Supreme Court precedent, emphasizing the importance of rights being rooted in tradition and history to prevent judicial policy-making. The decision raised questions about its broader impact on gay individuals' rights and the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell regarding state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on the rights of gay individuals and the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. It also sparked inquiries about the recognition of fundamental rights and laws prohibiting plural marriages. The Supreme Court's Obergefell decision raised questions about its impact on gay individuals' rights outside of marriage. The decision focused on marriage rights, not broader implications for sexual orientation classifications. If the Court had applied heightened scrutiny to sexual orientation classifications, it could have had wider implications for gay individuals' rights. The Court's Obergefell decision did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny. Prior to this decision, federal appeals courts had differing opinions on the level of scrutiny for such classifications. The Ninth Circuit suggested heightened scrutiny, while the Second Circuit also considered this issue. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing opinions on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth and Second Circuits suggest heightened scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit applies rational basis review. The Obergefell decision, focused on the right to marry, did not resolve this circuit split. The Sixth Circuit has held that classifications based on sexual orientation are subject only to rational basis review, unlike the Second and Ninth Circuits which suggest heightened scrutiny. The Obergefell decision, focused on the right to marry, did not resolve this circuit split, leaving the issue open for future lower courts to address. The ambiguity surrounding the level of scrutiny for laws based on sexual orientation could lead to differing outcomes in constitutional challenges, depending on the court. Some circuits apply heightened scrutiny, while others use rational basis review. This inconsistency may result in varying rulings on similar laws, creating potential for constitutional conflicts. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. However, the majority opinion seems limited to same-sex marriage, aiming to prevent extending the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The majority opinion in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, but some believe it may not apply to plural marriages. There are arguments both for and against extending the rationale of Obergefell to legalize plural marriage. Some commentators believe that the rationale of Obergefell may not apply to plural marriages, while others argue that it could potentially provide a basis for extending constitutional protections to plural marriages. The majority in Obergefell departed from precedent by considering individual autonomy and family in determining the fundamental right to marry, which could lead to an expansion of rights deemed fundamental in the future. The Court's departure from historical norms in Obergefell may lead to an expansion of fundamental rights in the future. It remains unclear which level of judicial review applies to state same-sex marriage bans, raising questions about scrutiny of government actions infringing on fundamental rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell expanded fundamental rights by applying heightened scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. This raises questions about the level of judicial review for government actions infringing on fundamental rights, potentially creating ambiguity in permissible government interference."
