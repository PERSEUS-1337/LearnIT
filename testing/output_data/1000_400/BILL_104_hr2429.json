The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for maintaining prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as agricultural producers lack incentives to retain such lands. States and local governments have also struggled to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to keep farmland in agricultural production. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands as owners lack competitive options to keep them in agricultural production, and states and local governments have not been able to provide sufficient incentives. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands as owners lack competitive options to maintain agricultural production. The Farms for the Future Act of 1990 is amended to include federal cost sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements. The term 'qualifying farmland' refers to land crucial for agricultural production and at risk of being converted to incompatible uses. A 'farmland protection easement' restricts land use to support continued agricultural production. Farmland protection easements restrict land use to support agricultural production in eligible states through a cost-sharing matching grant program. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements to preserve agricultural land from incompatible uses. Grants are typically on a 50-50 matching basis, but the Secretary can fund up to 90 percent of the acquisition cost. Matching grants under subsection (c) are provided on a 50-50 matching basis, but can be up to 90 percent for acquiring farmland protection easements. An eligible State cannot receive more than 10 percent of the total amount available for grants in a fiscal year, unless fewer than 10 states participate. In providing assistance under this section, the Secretary ensures that funds are used by eligible States to protect farmland, prioritizing lands crucial to the State's agriculture industry. The purchase price of farmland protection easements acquired should not exceed fair market value on average. The Secretary ensures that funds are used to protect farmland, prioritizing lands crucial to the State's agriculture industry. The purchase price of farmland protection easements acquired should not exceed fair market value. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
