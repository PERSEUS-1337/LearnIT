    "content": "The Navy conducted training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar, which environmentalists claimed harmed whales. The Navy issued an environmental assessment stating minimal harm to marine mammals. Environmental groups sought relief, leading to a preliminary injunction granted by the district court. The Navy conducted training exercises using sonar off the coast of southern California, leading to a legal battle with environmental groups seeking relief due to harm to marine mammals. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was later modified by the Ninth Circuit to allow the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. The Supreme Court ruled in November 2008, upholding the modified injunction. The Supreme Court ruled in November 2008 that the Ninth Circuit's test for issuing a preliminary injunction was too lenient. The Court stated that plaintiffs must show a \"likelihood\" of irreparable injury, not just a \"possibility.\" Despite potential harm to marine mammals, the Navy's need for effective training outweighed the plaintiffs' concerns. The Court ruled that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals, denying the requested injunctive relief. The decision was reversed, and the preliminary injunction was vacated. The Court did not address whether the Navy's exercises violated environmental laws. The Court's decision denied injunctive relief against the Navy's training exercises, citing national security interests. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, vacating the preliminary injunction without addressing the violation of environmental laws. The United States successfully challenged the Ninth Circuit's criteria for issuing injunctions. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's criteria for issuing injunctions related to environmental statutes, including regulations under the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act. The Forest Service promulgated regulations under the ARA, precluding notice, comment, and appeals for projects covered by categorical exclusions. This included salvage timber sales of 250 acres or less. The regulations were invalidated by the district court in a challenge related to a timber sale in 2003. The Ninth Circuit later held in Earth Island Institute v. Ruthenbeck that the regulations were invalid. The Ninth Circuit invalidated regulations under the ARA that precluded notice, comment, and appeals for post-fire forest projects. The court found that the regulations conflicted with the plain language of the ARA and issued a nationwide injunction against their application. The Ninth Circuit found that regulations under the ARA prohibiting notice, comment, and appeals for post-fire forest projects conflicted with the ARA. They issued a nationwide injunction against their application. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Forest Service's promulgation of these regulations and the standing of environmental groups challenging them. The Supreme Court is reviewing the Forest Service's regulations on post-fire forest projects, focusing on judicial review, standing of environmental groups, ripeness of challenges, and the Ninth Circuit's nationwide injunction. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform. The Supreme Court is reviewing the Forest Service's regulations on post-fire forest projects, focusing on judicial review, standing of environmental groups, ripeness of challenges, and the Ninth Circuit's nationwide injunction. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 8, 2008, but has not yet been decided. The stakes in this decision are potentially large as a defeat for environmental groups could increase the burden on public interest groups seeking to invalidate a government program. The Supreme Court is reviewing regulations on post-fire forest projects, focusing on judicial review, standing of environmental groups, ripeness of challenges, and the Ninth Circuit's nationwide injunction. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform. The case could impact public interest groups seeking to invalidate a government program. The Court may rule against a government program that harms aquatic organisms by withdrawing water from waterways for cooling facilities. Clean Water Act section 316(b) addresses this issue. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the issue of cooling water intake structures harming aquatic organisms. In 2004, EPA issued a rule governing these structures at existing power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available. However, in Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. In Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. EPA can consider cost in two other ways: to determine industry's capability and to conduct cost effectiveness analysis. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008, to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the \"best technology available\" for cooling water intake structures. The case was argued on December 2, 2008, with a focus on the resistance to cost-benefit analysis in the 1970s when federal environmental laws were enacted. In the 1970s, there was resistance to cost-benefit analysis when federal environmental laws were enacted. Recently, there has been a shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis, which will be tested in this Supreme Court case. The decision could potentially legitimize cost-benefit analysis in the Clean Water Act and federal pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's views are also under scrutiny in this case. The case involves Coeur Alaska proposing to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake. The industry hopes for a decision that could legitimize cost-benefit analysis in the Clean Water Act and federal pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation and cost considerations are also highlighted. Coeur Alaska plans to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake, which would harm aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act in 2005. In a legal case, the Ninth Circuit addressed different CWA regulations. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit in 2005 for Coeur Alaska's gold mine project in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. The Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting Clean Water Act regulations regarding the discharge of wastewater into a nearby lake, which would harm aquatic life. The Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting Clean Water Act regulations regarding the discharge of wastewater from Coeur Alaska's gold mine project into nearby waters. The court ruled that the CWA's Section 306 performance standard must apply through an NPDES permit, even if the discharge meets the definition of \"fill material\" under Section 404. EPA and the Corps did not intend for an exemption from performance standards when defining \"fill material.\" The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Section 306 performance standard must apply through an NPDES permit, even if the discharge meets the definition of \"fill material\" under Section 404. The court stated that EPA and the Corps did not intend for an exemption from performance standards when defining \"fill material.\" The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps to EPA under the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008, to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps to EPA under the Clean Water Act. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The consequences of a reversal could be significant if the Court gives the Corps wide latitude to remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" EPA and the State of California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA after cleaning up toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. The EPA and the State of California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA after cleaning up toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. Liability for cleanup costs under CERCLA attaches to past and present owners, operators, and those who arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at the site. The lawsuit targeted the defunct company that operated the facility, two railroads, including Burlington Northern, and Shell Oil Co. The EPA and the State of California sued for cleanup costs under CERCLA at an agricultural chemical facility. Liability attaches to past and present owners, operators, and those who arranged disposal of hazardous substances. The lawsuit targeted the defunct company, two railroads (including Burlington Northern), and Shell Oil Co. The district court found the railroads and Shell liable for a percentage of total cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed their liability for all cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of the railroads and Shell for cleanup costs at an agricultural chemical facility. The court found that the harm could be apportioned, but neither party provided a reasonable basis for doing so. The court found that the parcel became part of the facility, and only some toxic substances were stored there. Neither the railroads nor Shell provided a reasonable basis for apportionment of liability. The court also determined that Shell was liable as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA, as the transaction involved disposal of hazardous substances. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 1, 2008. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 1, 2008 to address the question of arranger liability under CERCLA, specifically focusing on whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells and ships a commercially useful product that results in disposal of hazardous substances. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address arranger liability under CERCLA, focusing on whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells a product leading to hazardous substance disposal. The case raises key Superfund Act issues, including joint and several liability for potentially responsible parties. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address arranger liability under CERCLA, focusing on whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells a product leading to hazardous substance disposal. This case raises fundamental Superfund Act issues, including joint and several liability for potentially responsible parties. The heart of the Superfund statute is its expansive liability scheme, designed by Congress to maximize the likelihood that solvent responsible parties would be found at a site to reimburse the government for its cleanup costs. The Supreme Court is addressing arranger liability under CERCLA, focusing on joint and several liability for responsible parties. The outcome could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs, potentially leading to the federal treasury absorbing more expenses. The Court's decision on what constitutes a reasonable basis for apportioning liability and \"arranger\" liability may affect the number of parties liable for cleanup costs. If the Supreme Court adopts a lax standard for finding a reasonable basis or a tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability than the Ninth Circuit, the federal treasury may have to cover more cleanup costs. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products that may not involve arranging for disposal. The outcome of the cases accepted by the Supreme Court could have implications beyond their individual programs. The Supreme Court cases accepted could have implications beyond their individual programs, with industry concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products that may not involve arranging for disposal. The environmental community is apprehensive about the direction the Roberts Court may take, as they have won in the decisions below in all five cases. The environmental community is apprehensive about the Supreme Court cases, especially since they have won in all five cases below. There is concern that the Court may rule against environmental interests, given past trends and the current Court's stance on regulation and business concerns. The Supreme Court has a history of ruling against environmental interests in NEPA cases. The current Court is less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns compared to previous decades. There is speculation that the increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random selection or conservative justices wanting to address these issues before potential changes in the Court's composition. The Supreme Court's increase in environmental cases this term may be due to various factors, including the Court's certiorari-granting process, conservative justices wanting to address these issues before potential changes in the Court's composition, and eminent Supreme Court practitioners showing interest in environmental cases. The Court continues to reject petitions for certiorari in difficult cases, such as the application of the Endangered Species Act and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court continues to reject petitions for certiorari in difficult cases, including the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, with the majority of petitions being turned down. The Supreme Court rejects petitions for certiorari in complex cases like the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act. Speculative reasons for nonacceptance include the majority of petitions being turned down. The Court's nonacceptance of cases is likely due to the same justices as in 2006 when Rapanos was decided, causing confusion in lower courts. If a post-Rapanos case were accepted now, a lack of majority support for a single rationale would likely result."
