    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" is cited as the short title of this Act. The Congress expresses its sense regarding the Act. The Congress acknowledges the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding permanent employment and emphasizes the importance of creating entry-level jobs. They believe that work experience in the private sector is crucial for developing valuable skills and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency. To maximize the economic value of AFDC payments, exchange them for work to provide recipients with a pathway to permanent employment. A one-year tax credit should be given to businesses for hiring AFDC recipients, as workfare programs are not a substitute for private sector experience in developing valuable skills. SEC. 35 introduces a refundable credit for hiring AFDC recipients under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A tax credit is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% credit for wages up to $6,000 and 25% for wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services rendered in the first year of employment. The tax credit allows for a 50% credit for wages up to $6,000 and 25% for wages between $6,000 and $12,000, attributable to services rendered during the 1-year period beginning with the day the individual begins work for the employer. Qualified wages are wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients. The tax credit provides a 50% credit for wages up to $6,000 and 25% for wages between $6,000 and $12,000, for services rendered within a 1-year period. Qualified wages are paid to qualified former AFDC recipients certified by the designated local agency. The tax credit provides a 50% credit for wages up to $6,000 and 25% for wages between $6,000 and $12,000, for services rendered within a 1-year period. Qualified wages are paid to certified former AFDC recipients by the designated local agency, who are members of families ineligible for benefits due to sufficient wages from the employer. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient replacing an employee terminated without cause. The tax credit provides a 50% credit for wages up to $6,000 and 25% for wages between $6,000 and $12,000, for services rendered within a 1-year period. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient replacing an employee terminated without cause. Technical amendments are made to certain sections of the Code. Amendments are made to various sections of the tax code, including inserting references to specific sections and updating the table of sections.
