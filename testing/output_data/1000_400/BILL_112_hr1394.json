    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with projections showing a significant increase in incidence by 2030. It causes more deaths annually than the next 4 leading causes of cancer combined. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a projected increase in incidence by 2030. It causes more deaths annually than the next 4 leading cancers combined. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 percent, while breast cancer has an 89 percent survival rate, prostate cancer 99 percent, and colon cancer 65 percent. Funding for lung cancer research is significantly lower compared to other major cancers. In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute highlighted the lack of funding for lung cancer research compared to other cancers. The report emphasized the need for an integrated research program but no comprehensive plan has been developed yet. Radon was identified as the second leading cause of lung cancer besides smoking, with 15 other environmental contaminants strongly associated with the disease. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants. Hormonal and genetic factors may also play a role in the onset of lung cancer. Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never smoked, and 60 percent are former smokers who quit years ago. Lung cancer in non-smokers is the sixth leading cause of cancer death. Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never smoked, with 60 percent being former smokers who quit years ago. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in various ethnic groups, including African-American males. Military personnel and veterans exposed to carcinogens are also at risk. African-American males are disproportionately impacted by lung cancer, with military personnel and veterans exposed to carcinogens at increased risk. Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment in health initiatives. An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 highlighted the risks associated with carcinogen exposure. An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 showed that early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 projected that the cost of life lost to lung cancer would exceed $433 billion by 2020, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could cut that in half. The National Cancer Institute's 2010 National Lung Screening Trial revealed promising initial results. The value of life lost to lung cancer is projected to exceed $433 billion by 2020, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could reduce that by more than half. The National Lung Screening Trial in 2010 found 20% fewer lung cancer deaths among participants screened with low-dose helical CT scans. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. Additionally, a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is proposed as an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020, involving various government agencies and stakeholders. The program includes specific requirements for the National Institutes of Health. The Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. The program includes requirements for the National Institutes of Health, such as strategic research grant prioritization and funding for research programs on lung cancer predispositions. The Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by funding research programs on lung cancer predispositions, interrelationships with other diseases, and innovative diagnostic and treatment methods. The Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering aims to accelerate the development of innovative screening, diagnostic, surgical, treatment, and drug testing methods for lung cancer. This includes expanding programs like the Quantum Grant Program and Image-Guided Interventions. Additionally, funds are provided to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for research on lung cancer incidence, and to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities for collaboration on prevention and early detection efforts. The Institute of Environmental Health Sciences will implement research programs on lung cancer incidence and provide funds for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to collaborate on prevention, early detection, and disease management research for minority populations. Funds will also be provided to the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiologic Health to establish quality standards and guidelines for various healthcare facilities. The Food and Drug Administration will provide funds to the Center for Devices and Radiologic Health to establish quality standards and guidelines for facilities conducting lung cancer screening using computed tomography. This includes expedited revisions for technological advances and conducting annual surveys to review compliance and evaluate performance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide funds for a Lung Cancer Early Detection Program targeting low-income, uninsured, and underserved populations at high risk for lung cancer. Additionally, funds will support research on environmental contaminants linked to lung cancer in the workplace by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program will provide funds for research on environmental contaminants associated with lung cancer in the workplace and implement measures to reduce lung cancer risk. State, tribal, and territorial plans under the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program must include measures to reduce lung cancer mortality. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will conduct an annual review of lung cancer early detection. The National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program includes measures to reduce lung cancer mortality, such as annual reviews of early detection methods and updated guidelines. Cooperation and coordination among programs within the Department of Health and Human Services aim to address the burden of lung cancer on women, minorities, and underserved populations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program within the Department of Health and Human Services focuses on addressing health disparities among women, minorities, rural, and underserved populations. It emphasizes cooperation and coordination of tobacco control and cessation programs to achieve its goals, including early detection protocols. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in developing a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program and implementing a demonstration project for military personnel and veterans at risk for lung cancer. They will also work on coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. (a) Sense of the Congress is to conduct a national computed tomography lung cancer screening demonstration project promptly to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with various agencies, will establish a demonstration project within a year to maximize public health benefits of screening. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project will identify optimal risk populations, develop effective screening processes, and ensure continuous quality improvements. The demonstration project aims to identify optimal risk populations for screening, develop effective and cost-efficient screening processes, ensure continuous quality improvements, and integrate health information technology into the healthcare system. Selected sites include National Cancer Institute Centers, Department of Defense Medical Treatment Centers, Veterans Affairs Healthcare Network sites, International Early Lung Cancer Action Program sites, and community health centers for minority and underserved populations. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer in various healthcare settings as part of the demonstration project. The Secretary will conduct a 5-year demonstration project for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer, requiring quality assurance programs and setting radiation dose standards. A report on project cost and progress will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will monitor programs under the Act, provide annual reports to Congress, and include members from various government agencies and fields related to lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, includes members from government agencies and fields related to lung cancer, such as clinical medicine, lung cancer research, radiology, drug development, minority health advocacy, veterans service organizations, and occupational medicine. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is provided to carry out the Act and its amendments."
