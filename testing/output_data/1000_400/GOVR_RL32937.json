    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 were reported in 2005, with the CSE program administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services. The CSE program, Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, was enacted in January 1975 and is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Other families must apply and states can charge an application fee not exceeding $25. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased from $1 billion to $21.2 billion. The number of children with established paternity increased by 1,274%. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations and payments for 50% of its caseload. In FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies reached $21.2 billion, with the number of children with established paternity increasing by 1,274%. The program collects only 18% of child support obligations and payments for 50% of its caseload, providing various services for children. The CSE program provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, child support order establishment, support order review and modification, support payment collection and distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods include income withholding, tax refund intercepts, liens, and reporting to credit bureaus. Additionally, there are civil and criminal contempt procedures and laws for criminal nonsupport. Federal legislation has established new criminal offenses for deadbeat parents. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States are required to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 mandated states to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and seizing assets of noncustodial parents. It also required states to withhold licenses of individuals who owe past-due support or fail to comply with legal obligations related to child support. Additionally, states were required to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize the financial resources of noncustodial parents in debt.

It also required states to withhold licenses of individuals who owe past-due support or fail to comply with legal obligations related to child support. Additionally, states were required to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize the financial resources of noncustodial parents in debt. P.L. 104-193 authorized the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents and required states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to clarify jurisdiction in cases involving multiple child support orders. The federal government reimburses states for administering their CSE programs and provides incentives for effective programs. The federal government reimburses states for administering their Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs and provides incentives for effective programs, including laboratory costs for establishing paternity. The CSE program has evolved into a multifaceted program focused on cost-recovery, service delivery, and promoting self-sufficiency and parental responsibility. The statutory limit for CSE incentive payments in FY2005 is $446 million. The Incentive Act of 1998 established a cost-neutral incentive payment system for the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The program aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents, promote self-sufficiency, and responsibility. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average and up to 30% for poor families. The CSE program aims to increase economic independence for single-parent families by improving child support collections. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 seek to simplify CSE rules and strengthen family-first policies, with the Senate bill including additional enforcement tools. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to simplify CSE rules and strengthen family-first policies for single-parent families with a noncustodial parent. The Senate bill includes more CSE provisions than the House bill, with details available in a side-by-side comparison table in the report. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state. As a condition of receiving TANF benefits, families must assign their child support rights to the state. This assignment covers all accrued child support payments, which are kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement for welfare benefits. Nonwelfare families applying for CSE services do not need to assign their child support rights and receive all collected payments. The assignment of child support rights to the state for TANF benefits determines which arrearages are permanently or temporarily assigned based on the date of the assignment. Pre-assistance arrearages are permanently assigned if the assignment was made before September 30, 1997, while post-assistance arrearages are only temporarily assigned. Nonwelfare families retain all child support collected on their behalf. The assignment of child support rights for TANF benefits determines which arrearages are permanently or temporarily assigned based on the date of the assignment. Arrearages accumulated while receiving assistance are permanently assigned to the state, while pre-assistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and revert back to the family when they leave TANF. Child support accrued before TANF benefits are not required to be assigned to the state under S. 667, allowing former-TANF families to receive any collected child support for pre-assistance arrearages. H.R. 240 does not change child support assignment rules for TANF families. Distribution rules determine the order of child support payments, crucial for paying off arrearages. The distribution rules determine the order of child support payments, crucial for paying off arrearages. States have discretion over their share of child support collections, but must pay the federal government. As of August 2004, 18 states continued the policy of passing through and disregarding $50 (or more in one state) of child support payments collected for TANF families. Both bills aim to incentivize states to allocate more child support directly to TANF families through federal cost sharing. As of August 2004, 18 states continued the $50 pass-through and disregard policy for child support payments collected for TANF families. Both bills aim to incentivize states to allocate more child support directly to families through federal cost sharing. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for states' pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month per child support collected for TANF families. The federal government would share the costs without requiring states to reimburse. This aims to increase direct child support payments to families. The House bill, H.R. 240, aims to incentivize states to increase their pass-through and disregard policies for child support payments to TANF families. It allows states to pay more child support to families without reimbursing the federal government. The subsidized payments would be above any amounts paid before December 31, 2001. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase child support payments to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The subsidized payments would be above any amounts paid before December 31, 2001, with the federal government sharing in the cost of the increase. The 1996 welfare reform law requires states to prioritize distributing child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursing the state and federal government. This \"family-first\" policy includes current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and pre-TANF arrearages. The goal is to increase child support payments to TANF families without federal reimbursement. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritizes distributing child support to former TANF families, including current support, never-assigned arrearages, and pre-TANF arrearages. Child support accrued before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. This aims to reduce reliance on public assistance by promoting TANF exit and preventing re-entry. States may choose to distribute the full amount to former TANF families under S. 667. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritizes distributing child support to former TANF families, including current support, never-assigned arrearages, and pre-TANF arrearages. S. 667 would simplify the distribution process and eliminate special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. The federal government would share costs with states to pay child support arrearages to families first. H.R. 240 also gives states the option to distribute the full amount of child support to former TANF families. The CSE distribution process would be simplified under S. 667 and H.R. 240, with the federal government sharing costs with states to pay child support arrearages to families first. Both bills also include provisions for lowering the passport denial threshold for noncustodial parents with past-due child support and facilitating child support collection. The bills aim to simplify the CSE distribution process by sharing costs with states to pay child support arrearages to families first. Provisions include lowering the passport denial threshold for noncustodial parents with past-due child support and facilitating child support collection from various sources. The bill aims to enhance child support collection by allowing the HHS Secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents with insurers, seize financial assets, and establish interstate child support cases. The bill includes provisions to expand states' ability to collect child support payments, such as authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators. It also mandates states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years and requires a report on locating custodial parents for undistributed child support. Both bills include provisions to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years, establish minimum funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service, and designate Indian tribes as authorized persons for accessing information. H.R. 240 proposes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but never on TANF, while S. 667 increases funding for the CSE access and visitation program. The CSE provisions in H.R. 240 and S. 667 include establishing a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but never on TANF, increasing funding for the CSE access and visitation program, requiring states to adopt a later version of UIFSA, and allowing Texas to operate its CSE program without a federal waiver. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of the CSE provisions in both bills with current law. Table 1 compares the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) provisions of S. 667 and H.R. 240 with current law, detailing the differences in each bill's sections."
