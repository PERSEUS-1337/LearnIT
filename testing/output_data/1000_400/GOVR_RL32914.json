    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. This has led to reduced ship procurement rates, causing concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Congress is concerned about the impact of reduced ship procurement rates on the Navy's future size and shipyards. Decisions on rising Navy ship procurement costs could affect Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Options include increasing funding, changing budget allocation, using multiyear procurement, altering acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard overhead costs, and improving efficiency. The report discusses options to reduce Navy ship procurement costs, such as using multiyear procurement, changing acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard overhead costs, improving efficiency, building ships without some equipment, and shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. It discusses potential advantages and disadvantages of this option and reviews recent legislative activity related to rising Navy ship procurement costs. The report reviews recent legislative activity on Navy ship procurement costs and discusses shifting to lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. Options for lower-cost designs include reducing ship size to decrease procurement costs. Options for lower-cost Navy ship designs can include reducing ship size and shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, which can significantly decrease procurement costs. The Navy is considering equipping ships with conventional propulsion to reduce costs significantly. They are also looking into building ships with commercial-like hulls and using a common hull design for multiple ship classes. The Navy is considering building ships with commercial-like hulls and using a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. This strategy can be applied more widely, such as using the hull design for the DDG-1000 destroyer as the hull for the planned CG(X) cruiser. The OFT report suggests building four large surface ships with a common merchant-like hull. The Navy plans to use a common hull design for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. The strategy can be applied more widely, such as using the hull design for the DDG-1000 destroyer as the hull for the planned CG(X) cruiser. The OFT report suggests building four large surface ships with a common merchant-like hull. Lower-cost ship designs using these approaches will be individually less capable than currently planned ship designs. Lower-cost ship designs derived from currently planned designs will be less capable individually. The report discusses potential lower-cost options for the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia class submarine per year. The report discusses potential lower-cost options for the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" submarines. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia class submarine per year, with plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. Maintaining the current procurement rate could result in fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The Navy's plan to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs, could involve procuring 35 boats during FY2007-FY2022. Options for lower-cost attack submarines include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered subs and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" submarines. Non-nuclear-powered subs are cheaper due to propulsion differences. The Navy is considering procuring reduced-cost SSNs using new \"Tango Bravo\" technologies developed by DARPA as successors to the Virginia-class design. Non-nuclear-powered submarines, like AIP-equipped ones, are cheaper and smaller than nuclear-powered submarines, extending their submerged endurance. A future Navy could consist of various new ships, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines procured alongside Virginia-class boats. The Navy is considering procuring AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The cost of acquiring four AIP submarines could be equivalent to one Virginia-class submarine, with an estimated unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million each. This strategy could potentially enhance the Navy's capabilities at a reduced cost. The Navy is considering procuring AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The cost of acquiring four AIP submarines could be equivalent to one Virginia-class submarine, with an estimated unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million each. This suggests that the annual cost of procuring one Virginia-class SSN plus one, two, or perhaps three AIP submarines could be equal to or less than that of procuring two Virginia-class boats per year. New technologies may allow for the design of a new SSN with higher capability standards. The Navy is exploring the possibility of acquiring AIP submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The development of new technologies under the Tango Bravo program aims to design a smaller, cost-effective submarine with equivalent capabilities to the Virginia class. This initiative focuses on reducing platform infrastructure and overall design costs for future submarines. TANGO BRAVO, derived from \"technology barriers,\" aims to demonstrate technology for a smaller submarine with VIRGINIA Class capabilities. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and design costs, enabling greater payload volume. DARPA and the Navy will collaborate on critical technology demonstrations in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal arrays, and simplifying submarine systems. The DARPA and Navy collaboration aims to reduce submarine platform infrastructure costs by developing critical technologies like shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal arrays, and automation. The goal is to design a new submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost, potentially 75% less. This new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN could be procured at a rate of two per year, offering an alternative to AIP submarines. A new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine is being considered as an alternative to AIP submarines. It would have capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost, potentially 75% less. Design work on the Tango Bravo submarine is being discussed, with the possibility of starting procurement in a few years. The Navy is considering a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine as an alternative to AIP submarines, with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost. Design work on the Tango Bravo submarine is being discussed, with the possibility of starting procurement in a few years. The current design options include a large nuclear-powered carrier like the George H.W. Bush and potential lower-cost options such as medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different hull designs. The Navy is building large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers like the George H.W. Bush, with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is part of the new CVN-21 class and is estimated to cost $10.5 billion for procurement. The Navy plans to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, as part of the CVN-21 class, with an estimated cost of $10.5 billion. Advance procurement funding has been provided since FY2001, and if procured in FY2008, it would enter service in 2015. CVN-79 is planned for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019, and CVN-80 is planned for procurement in FY2016. The Navy plans to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, as part of the CVN-21 class, with an estimated cost of $10.5 billion. If CVN-79 is procured in FY2012, it would enter service around 2019. Options for lower-cost carriers include a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA-6 design or a commercial-like hull design. The CSBA report recommends maintaining a force of 10 large carriers. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers as needed to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. It also suggested acquiring four medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carriers based on the LHA(R) design, with a unit procurement cost of roughly $3 billion. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier based on a commercial-like hull design developed in 2004. The OFT report recommended procuring a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons. It would embark a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft and 15 unmanned air vehicles, including F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. This carrier would be larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier recommended in the CSBA report and similar in size to the UK's new aircraft carrier design. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons, capable of carrying 36 manned aircraft and 15 UAVs. It suggested substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers. Additionally, it proposed a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship/catamaran hull design, intended for a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship/catamaran hull design. It would carry a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be faster than existing carriers from Thailand, Spain, and the UK. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship/catamaran hull design. It would be faster than existing carriers from Thailand, Spain, and the UK. The report suggested substituting eight of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Other potential designs discussed include a large, conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons, similar to the Kitty Hawk and John F. Kennedy carriers. A large conventionally powered carrier, similar to the Kitty Hawk and John F. Kennedy carriers, might displace about 100,000 tons and have a procurement cost several hundred million dollars less than that of CVN-78. Another potential design is a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull, displacing about 40,000 tons and embarking two dozen VSTOL JSFs. A nuclear-powered version of a carrier based on the LHA(R) hull might displace about 40,000 tons and cost more than $3 billion. It could embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs and be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. Another concept is a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots. It would have an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Different sizes of carriers can operate either VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with small carriers likely limited to VSTOL aircraft. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with larger ships favoring CTOL. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy has procured nuclear-powered cruisers in the past, but examples of small nuclear-powered carriers are possible. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975, ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. The current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser, with potential lower-cost options like an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers based on the DDG-1000 design. The Navy plans to procure the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser and potentially lower-cost options like an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The DDG-1000 would be larger than current Aegis cruisers and destroyers, with a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons. The first two DDG-1000s are estimated to cost about $3.3 billion. The DDG-1000 destroyer would have a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making it larger than current Navy cruisers and destroyers. The Navy estimates the first two DDG-1000s would cost $3.3 billion each, with the total procurement now reduced to 7 ships from the original plan of 16 to 24. The Congressional Budget Office and CAIG believe costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) believes DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, which also includes 19 CG(X)s. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, which could serve as a replacement for the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, incorporating similar technologies but costing substantially less to procure. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, incorporating similar technologies at a lower cost. It would have a reduced crew size and operational costs compared to current designs, with a smaller payload than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Aegis cruisers or destroyers. An air- and missile-defense version could carry two Advanced Gun Systems. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, with a reduced crew size and operational costs. It would have a smaller payload than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Aegis cruisers or destroyers. An air- and missile-defense version could carry two Advanced Gun Systems. Another option suggested is a smaller, less expensive frigate called the FFG(X) as a replacement for the DDG-1000/CG(X) and LCS programs, estimated to displace about 6,000 tons with a unit procurement cost of about $800 million. The FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the DDG-1000 and LCS programs, estimated to displace 6,000 tons with a unit cost of $800 million. It may not be equipped with the AGS but can perform non-gunfire missions. It would fill the gap between the FFG-7 and DD-963 designs in the Navy's surface combatant force structure. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 and DD-963 class ships, filling the size gap between them. Another option suggested is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship design. The option of a lower-cost gunfire support ship involves placing one or two AGSs on the basic LPD-17 hull design. The estimated cost for an initial AGS-armed LPD-17 is about $1.9 billion, with subsequent ships costing around $1.5 billion each. The Navy's current plan includes procuring 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its 313-ship fleet. The LCSs are small, fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The Navy aims for a procurement cost of $220 million per LCS sea frame. The total acquisition cost for 55 LCSs may average around $387 million. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant as an alternative to the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). This ship would have a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots, standard interfaces for modular mission packages, and self-deployment capabilities. The report also suggested supporting this ship with larger types of ships. Alternatively, the OFT report proposed procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be transported by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for a proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. They would be supported in theater by the mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. The lower-cost ship designs can be assessed for cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be supported in theater by a mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. The potential lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. Developing and designing a large, complex Navy ship can cost billions of dollars, so a complete assessment of cost implications would consider various factors. The cost implications of developing and designing a large Navy ship are significant, taking into account development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Stopping a planned ship program for a lower-cost design could save money in the long run if the new design is procured in large numbers to offset additional upfront costs. The cost implications of developing and designing a large Navy ship are significant, taking into account development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Stopping a planned ship program for a lower-cost design could save money in the long run if the new design is procured in large numbers to offset additional upfront costs. Lower-cost ship designs may reach break-even point sooner if existing programs are stopped early in development. Utilizing similar technologies from more expensive ships can reduce development costs. Learning curve effects decrease shipyard labor hours as workers become more familiar with the design. The cost implications of developing a new ship design could be reduced through the learning curve effect, where shipyard labor hours decrease as workers become more familiar with the design. If a lower-cost design is procured at a greater annual rate, it may reach break-even point sooner than a higher-cost design. The break-even point for a lower-cost ship design may be reached sooner if procured at a greater annual rate. Navy ships can remain in service for many years, with different classes having varying lifespans. The benefits of reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost can sometimes involve including design features that increase its procurement cost, such as automating functions to reduce crew size and personnel costs. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost can involve adding technology to automate functions and reduce crew size, which may increase procurement costs. Maintenance costs can also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing space for easier access during maintenance. Reducing maintenance costs in ship design may involve using more durable materials or increasing space for easier access during maintenance. Alternative ship designs with lower procurement costs may have higher life-cycle O&S costs. Nuclear-powered ships have different cost considerations as their procurement cost includes the nuclear fuel core. Navy expenditures over the long run are not just based on ship procurement costs. The life-cycle O&S cost of a conventionally powered ship includes fuel costs, while nuclear-powered ships have the fuel core included in their procurement cost. For example, a nuclear-powered attack submarine's fuel core in 2004 cost about $158 million and is designed to last its entire 33-year expected life. Similarly, a nuclear-powered carrier's core in 2004 cost about $300 million and is designed for half of its 50-year expected life. Despite higher procurement costs, nuclear-powered ships do not incur fuel-related expenses. The cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships is smaller when considering life-cycle O&S costs. Nuclear-powered ships have the fuel core included in their procurement cost, eliminating fuel-related expenses over their lifetime. This cost advantage is significant when comparing nuclear-powered submarines or carriers to conventionally powered ones. When comparing nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships, the total ownership cost, including procurement and life-cycle O&S costs, is smaller for nuclear-powered ships due to the inclusion of fuel costs in their procurement. This cost advantage becomes more significant with higher oil prices, making nuclear power potentially more cost-effective for powering ships in the future. The higher expected oil costs in the future could make nuclear power more cost-effective for powering ships, with nuclear-powered ships potentially having lower total ownership costs compared to conventionally powered ships. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to transport the reactor compartment to a storage area, costing around $30-35 million for submarines and more for carriers. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs, with submarines costing around $30-35 million and carriers costing roughly $570 million. Lower-cost ship designs may be less capable, except for the Tango Bravo SSN, which could match the Virginia-class design in capability. Factors like ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and numbers are considered for naval operations. The reduced-cost Tango Bravo SSN, potentially equal in capability to the Virginia-class design, utilizes advanced technologies from the Navy-DARPA Tango Bravo program. Ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and numbers are key factors in naval operations. As Navy combat ship size decreases, total payload decreases, impacting overall capability. Factors like propulsion affect the rate of payload decrease, making smaller ships proportionately less capable than larger ones. As ship size decreases, payload decreases more quickly, making smaller ships proportionately less capable than larger ones. One factor is propulsion: as ship size increases, horsepower needed decreases, allowing more room for payload. For example, a 40,000-ton carrier is about 40% as large as a 100,000 ton carrier but can carry less than 40% of the aircraft weight. Reducing the size of an aircraft carrier can significantly impact the total weight of aircraft that can be carried. A medium-sized carrier may only be able to embark a fraction of the aircraft weight compared to a larger carrier. Transferring an air wing from a medium-sized carrier to a larger one can increase the number of sorties per day due to the larger flight deck and fuel capacities. This reduction in ship size not only affects payload but also operational capabilities. Reducing ship size can impact the total weight of aircraft carried and operational capabilities. A carrier smaller than a certain size may not be able to operate certain aircraft or be equipped with desired systems. The total cost of combat-related equipment at sea can increase as ship size decreases, affecting the ability to deploy certain equipment. Reducing ship size can lead to challenges in equipping ships with necessary combat-related equipment. The total cost of deploying equipment at sea may increase as ship size decreases, impacting operational capabilities and total procurement costs. The use of new technologies could potentially mitigate some of these challenges by allowing for greater payload fractions on smaller ships. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload fractions on smaller ships by improving precision-guidance technology for weapons, allowing for smaller warheads to achieve the same damage. This could also apply to sensors like radars and sonars, potentially reducing the weight and volume needed on ships. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. They also claim that larger ships built to military standards are better equipped to withstand hits from weapons. Supporters of smaller ships argue that larger ships being less detectable adds to their cost, and a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities by presenting numerous targets. They also suggest that smaller ships are more likely to survive hits compared to larger ships. Supporters of smaller ships argue that larger ships being less detectable adds to their cost and that a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities. They believe that overall fleet survivability is more important than individual-ship survivability and that a fleet of smaller ships can have superior overall survivability. Additionally, they suggest that using expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations may not be ideal. Some argue that overall fleet survivability is more crucial than individual-ship survivability, suggesting that a fleet of smaller ships can be more effective. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant changes its mobility and operational capabilities significantly. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes its mobility and operational capabilities, creating a true submarine that operates primarily below the surface. Additionally, an AIP system can extend the submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine. An AIP system, like a fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engine, can significantly increase the stationary or low-speed submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine to up to two or three weeks. However, it does not enhance the high-speed submerged endurance, which is limited by the electrical storage capacity of the submarine's batteries. In contrast, a nuclear-powered submarine's submerged endurance is primarily limited by the amount of food available. Non-nuclear-powered submarines, even those equipped with AIP systems, have limited high-speed submerged endurance, unlike nuclear-powered submarines that can remain submerged for weeks or months at a time. This makes non-nuclear-powered submarines unsuitable for long, completely stealthy transits or extended submerged periods in theater of operations. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines on a transport ship for long, stealthy transits to the theater of operations. This may reveal their presence, unlike nuclear-powered submarines that can remain submerged for extended periods. SSNs in carrier strike groups can be detached and redirected to different theaters, providing a force-multiplying attribute. The OFT report discusses the strategic advantage of having SSNs in carrier strike groups, as they can be detached and redirected to different theaters without alerting opposing forces. This allows for military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The strategic advantage of having SSNs in carrier strike groups allows for military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. Nuclear-powered carriers can respond to urgent crises without the need for refueling, enabling immediate combat operations upon arrival. Nuclear-powered carriers have the advantage of high-speed transits over long distances, allowing for immediate combat operations upon arrival without the need for refueling. This enables them to sustain combat operations for longer periods before needing to be resupplied. Advocates of higher-speed ships argue that their increased capability to shift locations rapidly and evade enemy tracking justifies their higher speeds. Skeptics question the proven advantages of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Advocates of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that more ships allow for better global presence and response to multiple crises. Advocates of a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs argue that a fleet with more ships would be better able to maintain a day-to-day presence in multiple locations around the world or respond to simultaneous crises. They suggest that a fleet consisting of a larger number of less-capable ships could offer more flexibility in deploying naval capability at a lower daily cost. Additionally, they argue that the capability of the force grows with the number of nodes in the network, such as ships, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and sensors. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance the force's capability under network-centric warfare theory. They suggest a shift towards more distributed force designs utilizing advanced technologies. Defenders of a smaller fleet with expensive ships emphasize the importance of deploying capable ships to various global locations. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance the force's capability under network-centric warfare theory. Defenders of a smaller fleet with expensive ships emphasize the importance of deploying capable ships to various global locations, arguing that current ship designs already provide adequate flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate amounts of capability for responding to various situations. Advocates of a smaller fleet argue that current ship designs already offer flexibility for naval formations and network-centric warfare. Lower-cost options with technical risks include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and 1,000-ton vessels. The Navy's future fleet may include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and smaller surface combatants with new technologies. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships is more complex due to unique requirements like access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Smaller ships offer more homeporting options due to limitations in berthing spaces and water depth at some ports. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships can be more complex than conventionally powered ships due to unique requirements like access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Political challenges may arise when seeking permission to forward-homeport a nuclear-powered Navy ship in a foreign country with anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the Navy shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of work or its distribution among shipyards, which is largely dependent on available funding for Navy ship procurement. Lower-cost ship designs could affect the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work or the distribution of that work among various shipyards. The total volume of Navy shipbuilding work is largely dependent on the funding available for Navy ship procurement. Shifting to lower-cost designs may or may not impact the total amount of funding available for Navy ship procurement, which in turn would affect the total volume of shipbuilding work. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact Navy shipbuilding work in three possible scenarios: maintaining funding levels, reducing total costs for the same number of ships, or increasing funding for more cost-effective ships. This could also affect the distribution of shipbuilding work among different shipyards. The lower-cost ship designs in the report could impact Navy shipbuilding work by potentially increasing funding for more cost-effective ships, leading to a potential change in the distribution of shipbuilding work among different shipyards. Specifically, the design and construction of a Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine could involve General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyards. The potential involvement of General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyards in designing and building AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines could impact the division of work between the two yards. This could also affect U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers if AIP submarines are procured instead of nuclear-powered submarines. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in merchant-like hulls. This could impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers if AIP submarines are chosen over nuclear-powered submarines for export. A carrier based on the LHA(R) design could be built by NGNN or another yard like Ingalls. A medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier on a merchant-like hull could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in merchant-like hulls. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design might be built at various yards with experience in building such hulls. The procurement of conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones could impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. If conventionally powered carriers were procured instead of nuclear-powered carriers, it could reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant equals five submarine nuclear propulsion plants in terms of work provided. Larger surface combatants like DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. A 11,000-ton SCD, a 6,000-ton FFG(X), or a low-cost gunfire support ship could also be built at these yards or others like Avondale or NGNN. The DDG-1000 destroyers will be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Smaller surface combatants like the LCS will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA. A 1,000- or 100-ton surface combatant could be built at these yards or others. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 would limit the procurement costs of certain classes of ships. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 addresses the rising costs and production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill would limit procurement costs for specific classes of ships, while Section 1014 aims to establish a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The committee emphasizes the need to address internal DOD pressure to develop follow-on weapons systems with necessary military capabilities. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 highlights the rising costs and production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. The committee warns against an over-reliance on individual ''mega'' systems that are costly and time-consuming to develop, resulting in a ''high demand, low density'' situation that strains military resources and limits strategic depth. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 highlights the challenges of rising costs and production schedules in defense acquisition programs. This leads to fewer platforms being purchased, creating a \"high demand, low density\" situation that strains military resources and limits strategic depth. The Navy's shipbuilding plan is praised for providing a long-term view but criticized for unrealistic assumptions that may hinder its execution. The Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan, praised for providing a future view, is criticized for unrealistic assumptions hindering its execution. Concerns include affordability, requiring a significant increase in funds and avoiding cost growth in ship acquisition programs. Obtaining additional funds during anticipated federal spending reductions will be challenging. The Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan faces challenges in obtaining additional funds during anticipated federal spending reductions. Concerns include affordability and avoiding cost growth in ship acquisition programs. The U.S. shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base is also noted to have excess capacity. The Navy's shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base has excess capacity, impacting Navy ship acquisition programs. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee is concerned about the accuracy of the Navy's ship cost estimates. The committee is deeply concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting inaccuracies and exclusions in prior estimates. They recommend revising the process to ensure all major known elements of ship cost are included. The committee recommends revising the ship cost estimation process to include all major known elements and directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes, including CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships. The revalidated costs must be approved by the Under Secretary of Defense, with a report due by July 1, 2006. Additionally, the report addresses the DDG-1000 program. The Secretary of the Navy is required to submit revalidated cost estimates for specific ship classes to congressional defense committees by July 1, 2006. The report also highlights concerns about the affordability of the DDG-1000 program, with the Navy reducing the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 to meet budget constraints. The committee questions how the original requirements for the destroyer can be met with such a small number. The Navy proposed building 32 next-generation destroyers, reduced to 24, then finally to 7 for affordability. The committee doubts if original requirements like naval surface fire support can be met with such few ships. They suggest reducing DD(X) requirements for more affordable procurement. The committee supports building up to two DD(X)s for technology demonstration. The budget request lacked funds for the maritime technology program. The committee supports building up to two DD(X)s for technology demonstration to reduce naval ship construction costs. The budget request lacked funds for the maritime technology program aimed at enhancing shipbuilding efficiency and competitiveness. The committee supports initiatives to reduce naval ship construction costs through capital investments and specific contract incentives. They encourage expanding these efforts to all ship procurements, including the Lewis and Clark class program. Additionally, a provision creates a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity and cost effectiveness improvements.

Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes funding for long-lead components for aircraft carriers, aiming to address the low shipbuilding rates driving up costs. The committee report on S. 2766 highlighted concerns about the low shipbuilding rates driving up costs and urged for stable ship requirements, increased funding, and flexibility for funding large capital ships to reverse the trend. The report also expressed concerns about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urged for improvements in affordability for future aircraft carriers. The committee has expressed concerns about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urged the Navy and shipbuilder to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder aims to achieve savings for the CVN-21 class program through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity material procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement to potentially realize significant program savings. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class and submit a report to the congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement, directing the Secretary of the Navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for potential savings. None of the funds for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 can be obligated before 30 days following the Secretary's report. The procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to extraordinary escalation impacts. The report states that the procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to various factors. The Navy has implemented cost containment measures for CVN-77, including deferring upgrades and minimizing contract change orders. Additional funding for CVN-77 cost growth will be included in future budget requests. The committee is concerned about the Navy's projection that the cost of CVN-77 will exceed the contract ceiling by over 30%. Despite cost containment measures, the Navy is still expecting an increase in costs. The committee emphasizes the need for visibility into cost performance during the completion of CVN-77. The committee is concerned about the Navy's projection that the cost of CVN-77 will exceed the contract ceiling by over 30%. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit quarterly reports to assess the effectiveness of management actions and improve affordability of future naval vessels.

Concerns are raised about apparent cost growth and the rapid ramp-up in LCS procurement overshadowing affordability goals. The committee is concerned about apparent cost growth and rapid ramp-up in LCS procurement overshadowing affordability goals. There is a lack of clear acquisition strategy for strategic program decisions, and uncertainties about added costs for training, maintenance, and supply support for the LCS vessels. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program by December 1, 2006. The committee is concerned about cost growth and rapid ramp-up in LCS procurement overshadowing affordability goals. There is a lack of clear acquisition strategy for strategic program decisions and uncertainties about added costs for training, maintenance, and supply support for the LCS vessels. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a report on the LCS program by December 1, 2006, outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, cost containment strategy, R&D and procurement costs, and life cycle costs for two dissimilar LCS designs. (Page 113) Shipyard costs and efficiency are also addressed in the report. The report highlights the importance of assessing R&D and procurement costs for the LCS program, as well as the added life cycle costs for two different LCS designs. It also emphasizes the positive impact of the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) in reducing shipbuilding costs and improving efficiency. The committee supports the continuation of NSRP-ASE to enhance naval affordability. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million for the NSRP-ASE to support efforts in developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain, and exploring secondary markets for private shipbuilders. This initiative aims to improve the affordability of naval warship construction and maintain a healthy shipbuilding industrial base. The committee recommends funding for the development of a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain, exploring secondary markets for private shipbuilders, and enhancing computer interoperability in the shipbuilding industry. This includes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and unit procurement cost caps. Section 122 of the 5122 conference report authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and establishes unit procurement cost caps. Section 123 increases a procurement cost cap for the CVN-77 aircraft carrier, while Section 125 and 126 set unit procurement cost caps for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships and LPD-17 class amphibious ships respectively. Additionally, Section 215 allocates $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals, and Section 1016 directs the Navy to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. The new procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation and other factors. The Defense Acquisition Challenge Program includes Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. Section 1016 requires an assessment of naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. Section 122 does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. The conferees direct the Secretary to report any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs. The conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs in the annual notice to the defense committees.

The amendment allows adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk in the execution of the design effort for the LHA Replacement ship. Compliance with this provision may require procurement cost trade-offs that could impact system performance, safety, and other important factors. The Secretary must notify the Committees on Armed Services of any trade-offs not less than 30 days prior to implementation. The conferees believe that trade-offs in the design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship will be managed by the program office. The Secretary must notify Congress 30 days before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could impact safety or crew quality of life. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan, emphasizing the importance of cost control in ship design and construction. Navy leadership acknowledges the need for cost control but has not provided a plan or initiatives to meet cost targets. The Committee encourages the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop cost control initiatives, and sign contracts that reduce costs. The Committee recommends firm cost targets, specific initiatives, and cost-reducing contracts for Navy shipbuilding programs. A $141.4 million reduction in FY2007 procurement funding is suggested to cover cost growth on prior year's ships. Concerns persist over lack of cost control in ship construction contracts. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs, noting rising cost growth in ongoing ship construction contracts. The Navy's plan to address these issues was submitted late and mainly summarized cost overruns in shipbuilding over the past two decades. Despite public statements about the need for firm cost controls, programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines continue to exceed cost estimates, with an estimated $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to address these funding gaps. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines exceeding cost estimates. An estimated $867.9 million overrun is expected in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to address these funding gaps. The Navy is experiencing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, particularly with the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) and the Virginia class submarines. The Committee is hesitant to provide additional funding without a clear plan for cost control. A reduction of $141.4 million is recommended for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, with allocations specified for various programs. This reduction may involve adjusting ship procurement rates or exploring lower-cost ship designs. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, particularly with the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) and Virginia class submarines. A reduction of $141.4 million is recommended for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, with allocations specified for various programs like CVN-77, SSN-777, SSN-776, SSN-775, and the LPD-17 class. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to an average of $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars is proposed, but this may be challenging due to finite defense funding. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with recommendations for reducing funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars may be difficult due to finite defense funding. Options to modify funding for new Navy ships include using incremental funding or advance appropriations. The Navy is considering options to modify funding for new ships, such as incremental funding, advance appropriations, and multiyear procurement. These changes could potentially increase the number of ships procured but may also raise concerns about Congress's oversight and budget control. The Navy is exploring options to modify funding for new ships, including multiyear procurement (MYP) to increase ship procurement. However, not all Navy ship-procurement programs may meet the legal requirements for MYP, which could limit flexibility for future adjustments. Another option is to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, potentially reducing costs significantly. Changing the acquisition strategy for building Navy ships could lead to cost reductions, such as having all DDG-1000s built by a single yard instead of dividing them between two yards. This shift could save $3 billion for 10 ships, but may limit competition and innovation in design. Another option is to increase competition in Navy ship acquisition. The Navy could change its acquisition strategy for building ships by increasing competition, which could lead to cost reductions and innovation in design. This could involve using competition between shipyards for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. The Navy's potential change in ship acquisition strategy involves increasing competition between shipyards for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. This could lead to cost reductions and innovation in design, but requires careful consideration of procurement rates and potential consequences for shipyards. The Navy's contract-award decision could lead to a single source for building a specific type of ship in the future. To reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs, options include eliminating excess capacity or increasing other types of work like building ships for other government agencies or commercial purposes. To reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs, options include eliminating excess capacity or increasing other types of work like building ships for other government agencies or commercial purposes. Another option is to improve operating efficiency by incorporating advanced design and production processes. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to enhance efficiency. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve operating efficiency by comparing Navy shipyards to foreign shipyards and making recommendations for enhancement. One option suggested is to build Navy ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs, with the possibility of adding the equipment back later. Building a ship without planned equipment could reduce capabilities, but adding it later would increase procurement costs. Building in foreign shipyards may lower costs due to lower wages and material prices. Building Navy ships in foreign shipyards may lower costs due to lower wages and material prices. However, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits construction of vessels or major components in foreign shipyards, unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. The President can authorize exceptions for building Navy ships in foreign shipyards if it is in the national security interest. Congress must be notified, and no contract can be made until 30 days after notification. The provision excludes inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats. The fiscal year funds for shipbuilding prohibit using foreign facilities for constructing naval vessels in the US. A report by RAND Corporation discusses the increased cost of Navy ships and suggests ways to reduce costs."
