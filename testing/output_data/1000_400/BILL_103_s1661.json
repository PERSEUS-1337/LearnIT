    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use increases worker exposure to workplace injuries and illnesses. The absence of Federal standards leaves questions about the adequacy of warnings to be determined by inconsistent State requirements, placing a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by clarifying the proper use of personal protective equipment through uniform warnings. It also aims to preempt any conflicting State standards regarding the adequacy of these warnings. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use within 12 months of enactment. Personal protective equipment includes gear for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract protection in the workplace.

The standard mandates warnings for personal protective equipment to be communicated to employees, with exemptions for equipment placed in interstate commerce before the effective date unless warnings are communicated to the employer.

Section 4 and Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act are amended to clarify that Congress intends to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment and prevent states from establishing different standards for personal protective equipment once federal standards are in place. The Occupational Safety and Health Act prohibits states from establishing different standards for personal protective equipment once federal standards are in place."
