If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects. George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects. An Administration draft bill, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA), was transmitted to Congress on March 6, 2006. The bill proposed \"expedited rescission\" which requires at least one house to vote on the President's proposals for rescissions. If either house disapproves, the other house need not take action, as approval by both houses is necessary to make the rescission permanent. This contrasts with the \"enhanced rescission\" provision under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The \"enhanced rescission\" provision under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 altered the rescission framework to create a presumption favoring the President. Spending reductions identified in special presidential messages remain permanently cancelled unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill, requiring a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override a presidential veto. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate consideration of the President's rescission request. Expedited rescission bills require a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override a presidential veto. These bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate consideration of the President's rescission request. The expedited rescission approach transfers less power from Congress to the President compared to other approaches modifying the ICA framework. In the past, the House has passed expedited rescission bills, such as H.R. 2164 in the 102nd Congress in 1992. In 1992, 1993, and 1994, the House passed expedited rescission bills to allow the President to propose rescissions from appropriations acts. H.R. 2164 in the 102nd Congress had limitations on reducing program budgets, while H.R. 1578 in the 103rd Congress allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding. The House passed expedited rescission bills in 1992, 1993, and 1994. H.R. 1578 in the 103rd Congress allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding, with expedited procedures for floor votes and judicial review. H.R. 4600 in 1994 strengthened expedited rescission with fast-track procedures for consideration of a substitute amendment. In the second session of the 103rd Congress, H.R. 4600 passed the House in 1994 with a substitute amendment for expedited rescission. The bill allowed submission of a special rescission message at any time and authorized the President to propose the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. H.R. 4600 in the 103rd Congress allowed expedited rescission and authorized the President to propose repealing targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. A draft bill in 2006, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, proposed new provisions for the President to propose rescissions in a special message to Congress. The Veto Act of 2006, known as H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, proposed amendments to the 1974 ICA framework by introducing a new \"Legislative Line Item Veto\" allowing the President to propose rescissions of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting multiple rescissions without time constraints or limitations on the number of rescissions in a single message. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act (LLIVA) would grant the President flexibility in submitting and packaging special messages for rescissions without time constraints. Rescission requests would be considered under fast-track procedures, with adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps required within five days of enactment. Amounts rescinded must be used for deficit reduction. Under the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, the President would have flexibility in submitting rescission requests, with adjustments to committee allocations and spending caps required within five days. Rescission requests would be considered under fast-track procedures, with a vote on final passage required by the 10th day of session following introduction of the approval bill. The bill under consideration would expedite the process for reporting and voting on approval bills, with strict deadlines for committee action and final passage. The President would have the authority to withhold budget authority and suspend spending for up to 180 days. The LLIVA bill would allow the President to withhold budget authority and suspend spending for up to 180 days, with provisions not previously seen in expedited rescission bills. Supporters argue that this mechanism is necessary to give Congress time to consider a rescission proposal before an extended recess. Critics argue that the 180-day withholding mechanism in the LLIVA bill could be abused and is unnecessary, as the expedited procedures usually result in a final vote on the President's request within a month. They believe a shorter period would suffice for Congress to act on a special message and express concerns about the potential for multiple 180-day withholding periods. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism in the LLIVA bill argue that a period shorter than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to act on a special message. They are concerned about the possibility of multiple 180-day withholding periods and view the provisions as potentially allowing policy deferrals that were invalidated in previous court decisions. Supporters emphasize that the 180-day period is the maximum deferral allowed and the President can release funds earlier if deemed necessary. Supporters of the 180-day provision in the LLIVA bill stress that it is the maximum period for funding deferral, with the President having the authority to release funds earlier if necessary. The bill language does not mandate early release even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The LLIVA provisions are severable for judicial review, meaning that if a portion is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains in force. The act would be effective upon signing and apply only to spending or tax provisions in bills passed after its enactment. A court found a portion of the LLIVA bill unconstitutional, but the rest of its provisions would remain in force. The bill would become effective upon signing and only apply to spending or tax provisions in bills passed after its enactment. Other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including an omnibus budget reform measure containing provisions for expedited rescission. The provisions in Section 311 of H.R. 2290 would allow the President to propose rescinding wasteful budget authority in an appropriations act. The President could also suggest reducing discretionary spending limits. The bill limits the President to one message per appropriations act, except for accounts under multiple appropriations subcommittees. H.R. 2290 would limit the President to one message per appropriations act, except for accounts under multiple appropriations subcommittees. Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699, the \"SLICE Act of 2006,\" to enable the President to propose spending reductions and require Congress to debate and vote on them. The SLICE Act of 2006, also known as the Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act, allows the President to propose spending reductions for Congress to debate and vote on. The provisions in H.R.4699 apply to budget authority in appropriations acts or P.L.109-59. Senator John Kerry introduced a similar bill, S. 2372, for expedited budget item veto review. The draft bill introduced by Senator John Kerry, S. 2372, allows the President to propose cancellations of discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The bill aims to expedite the budget item veto review process, similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The President can propose cancellations of budget authority, spending items, and tax benefits. The process includes submitting a special message with a draft bill for each item to be cancelled. Expedited procedures aim for a vote on final passage within 10 legislative days. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667, which includes a legislative line item veto provision similar to bills from the 1990s. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667 on June 21, 2006, which includes a legislative line item veto provision allowing the President to propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. The bill would allow for expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the President's proposals, with limited opportunities for amendments. H.R.5667, introduced by Representative John Spratt, includes a legislative line item veto provision for the President to propose cancellations of spending and tax benefits. The bill allows expedited procedures for congressional consideration, with limited amendment opportunities. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee approved the bill, which was later passed by the House. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act with a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. On June 22, the House approved H.R. 4890 by a vote of 247-172. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act with a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. S. 3521 was marked up by the Senate Budget Committee and reported favorably. Table 1 provides a comparative overview of major features in three expedited rescission bills. Table 1 provides a comparative overview of major features in three expedited rescission bills: H.R. 4890 / S. 2381 as introduced, H.R. 4890 as passed by the House, and Title I of S. 3521 as amended by the Senate Budget Committee. The table highlights differences among the versions, with modifications made to lessen the President's flexibility in the House-approved and Senate Budget Committee bills. Noteworthy changes include the addition of a deadline for submission of special rescission messages within 45 calendar days in the House-passed version of H.R. 4890. The House-approved and Senate Budget Committee bills modified the original H.R. 4890 / S. 2381 to limit the President's flexibility. The House version requires special messages to be submitted within 45 days of enactment, while the Senate version allows up to one year. The Senate bill limits the President to four special messages per year, while the House version allows five per act or 10 for omnibus measures. The House version is more permissive in terms of the total number of special messages.

The House version allows a 45-day withholding period, with a 45-day extension possible, while the Senate version limits withholding to 45 days with a termination after four years. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits that can be canceled compared to the Administration's proposal. The House and Senate bills modified H.R. 4890 / S. 2381 to limit the President's flexibility in withholding funds. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits that can be canceled compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 would apply only to a revenue-losing provision affecting a single beneficiary, whereas S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify targeted tax benefits, while the House-passed version would require the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to identify such provisions. H.R. 4890/S. 2381 would allow the President to propose any targeted tax benefit that he identified. Another change in the House-passed version is its relationship to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, with the House version repealing most of the ICA except for certain sections. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President to propose targeted tax benefits and repeals most of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for certain sections. The bill also addresses expedited rescissions and the President's authority to propose rescissions with congressional approval. The House-passed bill allows the President to propose targeted tax benefits and repeals most of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The framework for expedited rescissions in the current bills would augment the President's authority to propose rescissions with congressional approval. A manager's amendment clarified that any amount cancelled from a trust fund or special fund would be returned to the original fund. All changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups.

A manager's amendment clarified that any amount cancelled from a trust fund or special fund would be returned to the original fund. Changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups, while S. 3521 would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected items but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. The amendment in S.3521 prohibits the President from resubmitting rejected items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits by Congress, but allows resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. It also aims to reduce the period for the President to suspend new spending or tax benefits. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure a vote on final passage within 10 days of introduction. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress aim to ensure a vote on final passage of approval bills within 10 days of introduction. The scope of coverage in these bills has varied over the years, with some focusing on proposed rescissions of discretionary budget authority. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills have evolved in scope, with H.R. 4699 adding transportation projects for possible cancellations by the President. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President broad authority for rescissions. The LLIVA grants the President extensive powers for rescission, including the ability to cancel discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. It is considered to be constitutionally sound, with provisions for expedited judicial review and a severability clause to protect the act if any part is found unconstitutional.

It is considered constitutionally sound, with a severability provision to protect the act if any part is found unconstitutional. The President has called for quick passage of the line item veto legislation in the 109th Congress. The Bush Administration is seeking enactment of the LLIVA in the 109th Congress, with the President urging the Senate to pass the line item veto legislation to target pork in spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline."
