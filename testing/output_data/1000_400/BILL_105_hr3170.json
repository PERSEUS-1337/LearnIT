    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code, which deals with gains from constructive ownership transactions. The new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions, treating such gains as short-term capital gain if they exceed the net underlying long-term capital gain. Additionally, the capital gain rate applicable is based on the rates that would have applied to the net underlying long-term capital gain. An interest charge may apply on the deferral of gain recognition. The gain under section 1(h) is determined based on the applicable rate for the net underlying long-term capital gain. An interest charge may apply if gain is treated as short-term capital gain, increasing the taxpayer's tax for the year. The taxpayer may be required to pay interest on underpayments of tax for prior taxable years resulting from including gain in gross income ratably during a constructive ownership transaction period. Any amount payable will affect the deduction for interest paid or accrued during the taxable year. Any increase in tax due to this provision cannot be offset by credits allowable under the tax code.
