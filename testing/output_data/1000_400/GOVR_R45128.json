    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included the Agriculture appropriations bill. The final appropriation of $23.3 billion for Agriculture was facilitated by new budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The Senate Appropriations Committee passed S. 1603 on July 20, 2017, and the House passed H.R. 3354 on September 14, 2017, with an enacted Agriculture appropriation of $23.3 billion for FY2018, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2017. The total FY2018 Agriculture appropriation, including mandatory spending, is $146 billion. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totaled $146 billion, with the House-passed bill at $20 billion and the Senate-reported bill at $20.53 billion. The appropriations also include mandatory spending of nearly $123 billion. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and the FDA in the Department of Health and Human Services. The Trump Administration released its full FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA and FDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service. It includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with discretionary amounts being the primary focus. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. The focus of the Agriculture appropriations bill is on discretionary amounts, which are controlled by annual appropriations acts. Discretionary spending receives most attention during the appropriations process, while mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules. In FY2018, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total budget. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total budget, with mandatory spending comprising 84% ($123 billion). The largest discretionary spending items include programs like WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, and food safety inspection. The largest discretionary spending items in Agriculture appropriations include WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. Mandatory spending items consist of SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs funded through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. SNAP requires an annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for programs such as WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, and food safety inspection. SNAP is a mandatory spending item that requires an annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. The bill's funding has fluctuated over time, with comparisons to historical benchmarks requiring adjustments for inflation and other factors. Agriculture appropriations have seen fluctuations, peaking in FY2010, declining through FY2013, and increasing since then. Historical comparisons may require adjustments for inflation. The discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008 is shown in Figure 3. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request later than usual in 2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request was delayed, released in 2017 with a proposed 21% reduction for USDA. Congress addressed the new request for FY2018 in May 2017, reminding the Administration of its role in determining appropriations. The Administration's FY2018 budget request overlapped with Congress finishing FY2017 appropriations. Congress reminded USDA and FDA of its authority to set funding levels for FY2018. The Administration released its full FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017, with some OMB proposals not aligning with USDA's request. CFTC requested a different budget amount than the Administration. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations in fiscal year 2018, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. The House Appropriations Committee made \"302(b)\" allocations to its subcommittees to facilitate markups. The House Appropriations Committee incrementally allocated funds to subcommittees for FY2018 bills. The Agriculture Subcommittee received nearly $20 billion for discretionary budget authority. The full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on July 12, 2017. The House later passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation on September 14, 2017, with Agriculture as Division B. The House passed an amended bill (H.R. 3268) on July 12, 2017, and later an eight-bill consolidated appropriation on September 14, 2017, with Agriculture as Division B. The $20 billion discretionary total in the House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation was $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017, achieved through reductions in various programs. The House-passed bill for FY2018 Agriculture appropriation was $1.13 billion less than FY2017, with reductions in rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $20.53 billion for FY2018 Agriculture. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee allocated $20.53 billion for FY2018, with a $352 million reduction compared to FY2017. The Senate-reported bill proposed fewer and smaller cuts than the House-passed bill, reducing rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million. The Senate-reported bill for FY2018 allocated $776 million more than the House-passed bill without the CFTC. It made fewer reductions compared to FY2017, reducing rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, it included $220 million more in reductions through rescissions and changing mandatory programs. The FY2018 budget began without an enacted appropriation, leading to Congress passing continuing resolutions (CRs) to fund the government. CRs maintain previous year's funding levels and provisions, with adjustments made through anomalies or administrative changes. The first CR for FY2018 lasted until December 8, 2017, with exceptions including a 0.6791% reduction and increased funding for mandatory programs like nutrition. FY2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56) continued FY2017 funding levels with exceptions: a 0.6791% reduction, increased funding for nutrition programs, and $2 million more for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. An anomaly for Section 32 funds was also corrected. The FY2018 funding levels (Division D of P.L. 115-56) included a 0.6791% reduction, increased funding for nutrition programs, and $2 million more for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. An anomaly for Section 32 funds was corrected. Subsequent CRs extended funding deadlines, with a government shutdown occurring until a fourth CR (P.L. 115-120) extended funding to February 8, 2018. The government faced shutdowns due to funding deadlines and budgetary offsets, leading to the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) that raised budget caps and provided disaster assistance for agriculture. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised discretionary spending caps, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, amended farm bill provisions, and extended sequestration effects. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended agriculture programs, raised discretionary spending caps, and provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for FY2018. It added $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the current farm bill. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated block grants to states for losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, as well as funding for conservation, watershed recovery, rural water, and wastewater recovery. It also provided $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the current farm bill, including funds for dairy programs, permanent disaster assistance, and cotton programs. The Act offset some of these additions by extending sequestration on mandatory accounts under the Budget Control Act for FY2026 and FY2027. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated funds for farm commodity programs, crop insurance, and base acre reallocation. It extended sequestration on mandatory accounts under the Budget Control Act for FY2026 and FY2027, impacting agriculture accounts by $2.6 billion. The Act raised budget caps for discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019, increasing nondefense and defense caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised nondefense discretionary cap by $68 billion and defense cap by $85 billion for FY2019. Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, with the Agriculture portion receiving $23.3 billion in discretionary funds, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2017. The appropriations also include nearly $123 billion in mandatory spending. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totaled about $146 billion, with a $1.38 billion increase in General Provisions. This amount includes $123 billion in mandatory spending and is higher than previous years due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act increases agricultural research spending by $138 million across four agencies, including additional funding for rural water programs, expanding rural broadband, Food for Peace foreign food aid, and opioid enforcement and surveillance at FDA. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation increases agricultural research spending by $138 million across four agencies, including additional funding for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and buildings and facilities. It also raises the base amount for Food for Peace by $134 million to $1.6 billion. Unlike previous years, there are no significant changes to mandatory program spending, costing about $740 million against the discretionary limit of the bill. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation does not include usual changes to mandatory program spending (CHIMPS), costing about $740 million against the discretionary limit of the bill. The appropriations are compared to previous years and different proposals. Sequestration is explained as a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory goals. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory goals. It is authorized in the BCA for discretionary spending through FY2021 and for mandatory spending through FY2027. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration on discretionary spending. Sequestration still applies to certain accounts of mandatory spending and has been extended multiple times to offset discretionary spending or other bills. The sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended multiple times to offset discretionary spending or other bills. Congress extended it by two years in 2013, another year in 2014, another year in 2015, and by two years in 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration. The sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts was extended until FY2027 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. OMB has ruled that most crop insurance is exempt from sequestration, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs have been subject to it. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts until FY2027. Crop insurance is mostly exempt, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs are subject to sequestration. Nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture faces a 6.6% reduction, resulting in about $1.3 billion less authorized in FY2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts until FY2027, resulting in a 6.6% reduction in nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture, amounting to about $1.3 billion less authorized in FY2018. Tables A-1 and A-2 provide details on the rates of sequestration and the total amounts of budget authority cancelled from accounts in the Agriculture appropriations bill."
