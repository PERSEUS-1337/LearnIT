It also authorizes the creation of regional centers for transportation solutions and provides for the appointment of a Director of National Transportation Research. Congress finds that research and development are crucial for a transportation system that meets safety, mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and environmental protection goals. Federal investment in transportation research is only about 1% of overall government spending on transportation programs. Despite a 40% increase in funding for transportation programs, funding for research and development has remained stagnant. Insufficient resources are allocated for long-term transportation research goals. Funding for transportation research and development has remained flat despite the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. There is a need for more resources for long-term transportation goals, and competitive, peer-reviewed research funding is best for addressing strategic research needs. The diversity of transportation research programs poses challenges for effective regional and university-based research centers. Effective priority setting is difficult due to the wide-ranging subject matter of transportation research. To ensure the United States transportation system meets safety, mobility, economic vitality, equity, and environmental goals, it is important to increase Federal investment in long-range planning, support competitive research, and coordinate research programs within the Department of Transportation.
