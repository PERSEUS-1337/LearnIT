    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, with over $40 billion in annual benefits. Approximately 8.2 million individuals are covered each year, with participation being voluntary. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans in fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Premiums are shared between the federal. In 2016, a new coverage option called self plus one was introduced for federal employees and their eligible family members under the FEHB Program. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with shared premiums between the government and employees. All plans cover basic services like hospital and physician care, with varying cost sharing. Prior to 1959, federal employees had to obtain health insurance independently or through limited union plans. Prior to the creation of FEHB in 1959, federal employees could not obtain health insurance through the government. Employers in the private sector started offering health insurance in 1950. President Truman's Commission recommended federal government health insurance in 1951. Congress passed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) to establish eligibility and coverage options. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established parameters for health insurance coverage for federal employees, including eligibility, coverage options, and the government's share of premiums. It also created the Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in managing the program. FEHBA allows enrollees to choose between different coverage options offered by private insurers. FEHBA, enacted in 1959, established health insurance guidelines for federal employees. OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and regulate FEHB. While the basic model of FEHB remains the same, changes have been made to premium cost-sharing and eligibility. Congress plays a role in modifying FEHB through legislative authority. Since its inception in 1959, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has undergone various modifications. Changes to the government's share of premiums, eligibility, services, and benefits have been made over time. Congress has a role in modifying FEHB through legislative authority. The program's model involves competing insurers offering coverage options to enrollees with minimal intervention from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This model is seen as successful in allowing enrollees to make cost-conscious choices. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program allows competing insurers to offer coverage options to enrollees with minimal intervention from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This model is viewed as successful in enabling enrollees to make cost-conscious choices and constrain overall cost growth. Researchers have explored exporting aspects of the FEHB model to other health care programs, such as Medicare, and expanding access to FEHB for individuals like small business employees or the uninsured. Policymakers have introduced legislation to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility for small business employees or the uninsured. Lessons from FEHB may be useful for state and federal officials establishing health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential as a model for other programs, as Congress has a financial interest in its viability and sustainability. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has sparked Congressional interest in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. Congress has a financial stake in FEHB's viability and can restructure it as needed. This report explains how FEHB has evolved and how Congress has interacted with the program, including conditioning federal funds on policy changes. The report discusses how Congress has influenced the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program by conditioning federal funds on policy changes, adjusting the government's share of FEHB premiums, modifying program eligibility, and implementing policies affecting Medicare and FEHB. Congress has the authority to make changes to FEHB, such as prohibiting the use of federal funds for certain purposes like covering abortions. The Appendix contains a summary of the enacting FEHB legislation and a list of laws that have amended or affected FEHB by placing conditions on the use of federal funds. For example, in 1983, Congress passed a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of danger to the woman's life. This provision has been renewed annually with some changes. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with conditions placed on the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of danger to the woman's life. The legislation created a formula in 1971 for the government's share of premiums, which increased to 50% in 1974. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made changes to the big six formula. The government's share of FEHB premiums increased over the years, with a formula created in 1971 and set at 40%, then increased to 50% in 1974. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Eligible participants include federal employees, retirees, and their family members. Since its enactment, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) has expanded eligibility to enroll in FEHB to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees were included, and in 1988, certain temporary workers were also covered. Additionally, in 1988, Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for employees separated from service for reasons other than gross misconduct, who can continue coverage by paying the entire FEHB premium. FEHB was extended to part-time employees in 1978 and to certain temporary workers in 1988. Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) allows separated employees to continue FEHB coverage by paying the full premium. TCC is available for up to 18 months, with exceptions for children aging out of their parents' plans. Initially, there was little interaction between FEHB and Medicare due to federal employees' ineligibility for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program was established in 1959, with limited interaction with Medicare until 1982 when federal workers became eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. Exceptions include 36 months of coverage for children aging out of their parents' plans. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program was established in 1959 for federal workers, with eligibility for Medicare based on federal employment starting in 1982. The FEHB Act of 1959 outlined program parameters, eligibility, benefits, premium shares, and OPM's role. Eligible participants included current federal employees and retirees with at least 12 years of service or a disability retirement after July 1, 1960. Retirees had to be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years immediately. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, established in 1959, included current federal employees and retirees eligible for Medicare. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) played a role in approving health benefit plans for FEHB participation. Eligible participants had to meet specific criteria, including enrollment in an FEHB plan for a certain period before retirement. OPM could contract or approve Service Benefit Plans and Indemnity Benefit Plans for FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program offers various health benefit plans for participants, including Service Benefit Plan, Indemnity Benefit Plan, Employee Organization Plans, and Comprehensive Medical Plans. These plans provide different levels of benefits and payment arrangements for healthcare services. Employee organization plans in the FEHB program are available to employees, retirees, and their families. These plans offer health services on a prepaid basis provided by physicians practicing as a group or individually. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans depends on the type of plan and enrollee, with a 50% share for certain plans and a set biweekly government share for individual coverage. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans varies based on the type of plan and enrollee. For service benefit and indemnity plans, the government covers 50% of the lowest carrier rate. Biweekly government shares range from $1.25 to $4.25 for individual coverage and $3.00 to $4.25 for family coverage, with specific amounts for female employees with family coverage. For employee organization and comprehensive medical plans, the government covers 50% of the biweekly premium up to certain limits. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans varies based on the type of plan and enrollee, with biweekly shares ranging from $1.25 to $4.25 for individual coverage and $3.00 to $4.25 for family coverage. Female employees with family coverage receive a specific percentage of the premium. Additionally, the Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and their dependents. P.L. 86-568 and P.L. 88-59 expanded FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and their dependents. P.L. 88-59 extended the deadline for applications from qualified employee organizations to participate in FEHB. Prior to the act's passage, employee organizations had to offer health care benefits to members by July 1, 1959 to be approved for FEHB coverage. P.L. 88-284 expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed employees to continue FEHB coverage in retirement if enrolled by December 31, 1964. OPM was given discretionary authority to terminate FEHB plan contracts with carriers who did not comply. The act expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It allowed retirees enrolled by December 31, 1964 to continue their coverage. OPM was given authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. The government's share of premiums was made equal for all enrollees, regardless of gender. Premium shares were adjusted for employee organization and comprehensive medical plans.
