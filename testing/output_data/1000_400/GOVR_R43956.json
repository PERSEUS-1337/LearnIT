Administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved, with the majority related to atomic weapons testing. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. Administered by the Department of Justice, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved. The program will sunset on July 10, 2022, and all benefit applications must be filed before that date. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000, P.L. 106-245, require all RECA benefit applications to be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992, with the majority (928) at the Nevada Test Site. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992, with the majority (928) at the Nevada Test Site. Of these, 828 were underground tests and 100 were atmospheric tests, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The atmospheric tests at NTS were conducted between January 27, 1951, and October 30, 1958, and again between July 7, 1962, and July 17, 1962. Table 1 summarizes U.S. atomic weapons tests conducted in the continental United States and Alaska, with the largest atmospheric test at NTS being the Hood Test on July 5, 1957. The RECA program offers benefits to onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers affected by these tests. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program provides one-time lump sum payments to individuals affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Benefits are not adjusted for inflation and are not subject to federal income tax. However, they may be reduced by other compensation received for related illnesses or injuries. No medical benefits are provided by RECA, but uranium workers are eligible for an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits for related medical costs. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program provides one-time lump sum payments to individuals affected by atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. Eligible uranium workers can receive $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. Benefits are paid to the claimant or their survivors in a specific order of precedence. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program provides one-time lump sum payments to individuals affected by atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. Benefits are paid to the claimant or their survivors in a specific order of precedence, with eligibility based on exposure and disease requirements for onsite participants. To be eligible for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must have been present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing in specific geographic areas, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, and designated exclusion zones. The eligibility for RECA benefits includes being present at specific test sites for atomic weapons testing and designated exclusion zones. This includes locations like Bikini Atoll, Enewetak Atoll, Johnston Island, Christmas Island, Trinity Test Site, and South Atlantic Test Site for Operation Argus. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for individuals who were present at designated locations during atmospheric atomic weapons testing. Occupations and activities performed during this period are specified for qualification for benefits under RECA. Eligibility criteria for individuals present at designated locations during atmospheric atomic weapons testing include being a civilian or contract employee of various government agencies, performing specific duties during nuclear detonations, participating in decontamination efforts, and serving in certain roles on the atoll of Enewetak between June 21, 1951, and July 1, 1952. These activities qualify individuals for benefits under RECA. Individuals eligible for RECA benefits include those who were involved in operational areas during atmospheric nuclear detonations, participated in decontamination efforts, served on the atoll of Enewetak during specific timeframes, or were part of a radiological safety team monitoring fallout patterns. To qualify, individuals must have contracted specified cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. To be eligible for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period between 1951 and 1962 and contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from an atmospheric atomic weapons test. To qualify for RECA benefits as a uranium miner, one must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971, or have been exposed to at least 40 working-level months of radiation during this period in specific states listed in Table 4. To qualify for RECA benefits, uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine between 1942 and 1971 or been exposed to 40 working-level months of radiation in specific states listed in Table 4. Lung cancer or specific respiratory diseases must have developed after radiation exposure, and uranium millers must meet exposure and disease requirements. Uranium millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in a uranium mill or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 in specific states listed in Table 4. The required diseases after radiation exposure include lung cancer, renal cancer, chronic renal disease, or non-malignant respiratory diseases like fibrosis of the lung. Uranium millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in a uranium mill or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 in specific states listed in Table 4. The required diseases after radiation exposure include lung cancer, renal cancer, chronic renal disease, or non-malignant respiratory diseases like fibrosis of the lung. DOJ's Civil Division administers the RECA program and makes eligibility decisions on claims, which must be submitted with written documentation of illnesses. Benefit claims for RECA must be submitted in writing on standard forms provided by DOJ. Claimants need to provide written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits, with detailed requirements outlined in RECA regulations. Application decisions are made by an assistant director within the DOJ Civil Division, with a 12-month deadline for a decision to be reached. If no decision is made within 12 months, the application is automatically approved for benefits. Native American cases must consider Native American law, tradition, and custom in the application and payment procedures. Decisions for RECA benefits are made by an assistant director within the DOJ Civil Division. Applications must be processed within 12 months, or they are automatically approved. The 2000 RECA amendments authorized HHS to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. These grants are administered by RESEP, with six clinics currently operating in five states. The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) provides assistance with securing medical documentation for RECA claims. There are six RESEP clinics in five states, including one for Native Americans. Applicants can appeal denials of RECA benefits to the DOJ within 60 days. An appeal can be made to the DOJ within 60 days of the initial decision, with a ruling by an appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division. If dissatisfied, applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Representation by licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations is allowed, with limitations on fees that may be collected. Representation by licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations is allowed for RECA claimants, with limitations on fees that may be collected. Licensed attorneys can collect 2% or 10% of benefits awarded based on the contract date, while non-attorney representatives cannot charge fees. In unsuccessful claims, attorneys can recover costs. The RECA program allows licensed attorneys to collect 2% or 10% of benefits awarded based on the contract date. In unsuccessful claims, attorneys can recover costs. Legislation may expand eligibility for downwinders and provide benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. No statutory changes have been made to the RECA program since 2000. Some Members of Congress are pushing for legislation to expand eligibility for downwinders and provide benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Current RECA program requirements limit benefits to those present in designated counties during atmospheric testing at NTS, excluding residents of other affected areas. No statutory changes have been made to the RECA program since 2000. Residents of areas outside of the current downwinder eligibility area had concerns about health effects from atomic weapons testing fallout. They tried to seek compensation through civil courts but were unsuccessful, leading to the creation of the RECA program in 1990. New downwinder eligibility areas cannot be added to the program through regulation or executive action. The inability of downwinders to win civil judgments against the federal government or atomic weapons testing contractors led to the creation of the RECA program in 1990. Bills were introduced in 1979 to compensate civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS, including those with cancer and sheep herds damaged by the tests. The bill H.R. 4766 aimed to provide coverage for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and affected sheep herds. Eligibility for downwinders included those with leukemia, thyroid cancer, bone cancer, or any other cancer occurring more frequently in the affected area. The proposed affected area for downwinder eligibility was a rectangular region around NTS, spanning across Nevada, Utah, parts of California, Arizona, Mohave, and Coconino Counties. A companion Senate bill, S. 1865, also aimed to provide compensation. The proposed boundaries for the affected area by H.R. 4766 include parts of Nevada, Utah, Inyo County in California, Mohave and Coconino Counties in Arizona. A federal advisory board would be created to add specified cancers to the list for compensation. The affected area for downwinder eligibility includes specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The bill proposed expanding the affected area for downwinder eligibility to include specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would have the authority to add to the list of affected areas. The original RECA statute covered a smaller area than what is currently included in the program. The RECA statute originally had a smaller downwinder eligibility area, but it was expanded with the 2000 amendments to include additional areas in Arizona and Utah. Members of Congress have introduced bills to further expand the eligibility area. Since the 2000 RECA amendments, efforts have been made by Members of Congress to expand the downwinder eligibility area to include more states and territories affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing. Legislation has been proposed to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Guam, and those affected by fallout from the Trinity test in New Mexico. In response to a mandate from Congress, HRSA asked the NRC to study the health effects of radiation exposure from atomic weapons testing. The NRC recommended against expanding downwinder eligibility based solely on geographic area. The NRC recommended against expanding downwinder eligibility based solely on geographic area for RECA benefits, citing studies showing NTS fallout covered the entire country. They advised a science-based approach considering factors like location, outdoor time, and milk consumption for determining eligibility. The NTC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like location, outdoor time, and milk consumption. The ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk was a significant exposure pathway. The NRC report suggested using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits, making every person eligible to apply. The NRC recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits, estimating absorbed dose of radionuclides for each applicant based on various factors. This model would calculate the probability that the individual's specific cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, with Congress setting the threshold for awarding benefits. This approach, similar to methods used for EEOICPA and VA benefits, would make every person eligible to apply for benefits. The NRC recommended a model of probability of causation to evaluate claims for benefits based on exposure to ionizing radiation. This model, similar to methods used for EEOICPA and VA benefits, would calculate the probability of cancer causation for each individual, with Congress determining the threshold for awarding benefits. This approach has not been part of the RECA program or its amendments, which currently rely on a geographic-based eligibility model. The NRC recommended a probability of causation model for evaluating claims related to ionizing radiation exposure, which differs from the presumption of eligibility model used in RECA. The NRC's model may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels and the limited cancer-causing potency of ionizing radiation. Congressional changes to eligibility criteria based on the NRC's report are expected to lead to few successful claims. The NRC states that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to cause cancer in most cases. Changes in eligibility criteria for compensation are expected to result in few successful claims. RECA benefits for uranium workers are only available if exposed before 1972. The December 31, 1971 cut-off date was chosen due to the end of uranium procurement for atomic weapons in 1971. Since 1972, RECA benefits for uranium workers are only available if exposed to radiation before 1972. Legislation has been introduced to expand eligibility to those exposed after 1971, due to the continued mining and milling of uranium for nuclear power plants. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to include uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, advocating for the inclusion of uranium mine core drillers and research into health effects of uranium tailing piles. Despite safety regulations, uranium workers, especially miners, are still at risk for radon-induced diseases due to elevated radiation exposure limits. Despite safety regulations enacted since 1971, uranium workers, particularly miners, are still at risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits. The current Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) limit of 4 WLM exceeds the recommended limit of 1 WLM by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The intent of the RECA program is to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners working for the nuclear weapons program. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners working for the nuclear weapons program. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, potentially beyond the program's original intent. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients may already be covered by state workers' compensation systems.
