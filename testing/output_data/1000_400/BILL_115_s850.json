    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for foreign medical schools to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit Caribbean medical schools receive the majority of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other foreign medical schools. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommends equal eligibility requirements for all foreign medical schools to participate in Federal funding. Foreign graduate medical schools should meet the same eligibility requirements for Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act. US medical schools have a lower attrition rate compared to for-profit Caribbean medical schools. Residency match rates for foreign trained graduates are lower than US graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduated students in a graduate medical school outside the United States were not described in section 484(a)(5) in the previous year, and at least 75 percent of students seeking a loan under part D of title IV meet this criteria. At least 75 percent of individuals who were students or graduates of a graduate medical school outside the United States or Canada received a passing score on exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the previous year. In the previous year, 75% of individuals from foreign medical schools passed exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. The authority for these schools to qualify for loan programs under title IV will expire. The authority of a graduate medical school to qualify for loan programs under title IV will expire on July 1 following the enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, enrolled students can still receive loans until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
