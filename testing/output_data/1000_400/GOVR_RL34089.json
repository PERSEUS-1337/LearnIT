    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, are the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire in FY2007. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs due to funding uncertainty. The agency is using reserve funds to prevent layoffs, resulting in a hiring freeze and impacting employee morale. 30% of employees are eligible for retirement. The FDA is facing funding uncertainty leading to a hiring freeze and layoff notifications. The agency's Commissioner highlighted that this uncertainty is affecting employee morale, with 30% eligible for retirement. The bills also reauthorize key authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the FDA regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products must undergo premarket approval before entering commerce, with postmarket surveillance. FDA has authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market. The FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market, with little oversight in commerce. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding for ensuring product safety, especially for products requiring premarket approval. Key issues include balancing the need to speed safe products to market and correcting or removing unsafe ones. The 110th Congress is grappling with the issue of balancing the FDA's role in speeding safe products to market and removing unsafe ones. Key concerns include FDA's ability to ensure product safety and respond to health threats quickly. Congress has authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to help expedite product approval, but some question the agency's reliance on these fees. Reauthorization of user fee authorities (PDUFA and MDUFMA) is a current focus. Congress has passed measures authorizing FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers, with some questioning the agency's reliance on these fees. Efforts to reauthorize PDUFA and MDUFMA are underway, as they account for a significant portion of FDA's budget. PDUFA was first enacted in 1992 and has been reauthorized twice. In FY2008, PDUFA and MDUFMA fees would generate $386,695,000, accounting for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total budget. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows FDA to collect fees for drug and biological product reviews. MDUFMA, established in 2002, sets user fees for medical device applications. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and the Medical Device User Fee Modernization Act (MDUFMA) established user fees for FDA reviews of drugs, biological products, and medical devices. These acts also set performance goals to reduce premarket review times. MDUFMA allowed third-party inspections and added regulations for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA relate to user fees and performance goals. Researchers often avoided testing drugs on children in clinical trials, leaving clinicians with unknown information on appropriate dosages and side effects for pediatric use. In 1997, Congress passed BPCA to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating a drug's effect on children. FDA's attempts to require assessments of new drugs on pediatric populations were initially stopped by the courts until Congress codified the requirement in PREA in 2003. BPCA and PREA provide incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of drugs. The BPCA and PREA laws provide incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of drugs, including marketing exclusivity. Developing medical devices for children is challenging due to lower demand and unique physical attributes. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases. The critical need for pediatric medical devices is due to unique physical attributes and lower demand compared to adults. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 offer incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric devices and give FDA authority for postmarket studies to ensure safety and efficacy. Adverse effects of medical products may not be fully revealed until a product is on the market. The need for pediatric medical devices is crucial due to unique physical attributes and lower demand compared to adults. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 provide incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric devices and give FDA authority for postmarket studies to ensure safety and efficacy. Adverse effects of medical products may not be fully revealed until a product is on the market, requiring FDA to collect data on marketed products and take necessary actions. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to strengthen FDA's data collection system for marketed products, identify situations requiring FDA action, and grant new authorities for manufacturers to take necessary actions. Medical journals tend to publish positive clinical trial results, while negative results may not be disclosed, raising concerns about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved products. In 2004, Congress and others questioned the safety of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address public access to clinical trial results. FDA advisory committees provide independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, but conflicts of interest may undermine credibility. FDA uses advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, devices, and food. Committees may have conflicts of interest, leading to bias in drug approval. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address conflicts of interest among advisory committee members. The media has reported bias and conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees since 2007. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to revise FDA's approach to conflicts of interest among committee members. In 2004, FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical product submissions, attributing it to the difficulty and unpredictability of product development. The report called for modernizing scientific tools and utilizing bioinformation for evaluating medical products. The report highlighted the challenges in medical product development and emphasized the need to modernize scientific tools and utilize bioinformation for evaluation. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose the creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation to support FDA in these efforts. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources, regulated by FDA law. Some consumers seek medications from foreign sources due to high drug costs in the US. Current law tightly regulates drug importation by permitting only manufacturers to import prescription drugs. Lawmakers are exploring ways to allow access to lower-priced medications while ensuring safety. S. 1082 includes provisions for regulating importation of prescription drugs, but an amendment requiring certification from the Secretary of HHS may nullify detailed importation language. The FDA has had responsibility for regulating food safety since 1906, with its authority evolving over time. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about both domestic and imported food products. Provisions in S. 1082 aim to address food safety issues. The FDA has been regulating food safety since 1906. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about domestic and imported food products. Provisions in S. 1082 address some key issues in food safety reform that Congress may consider. The FDA reauthorization and reform bills cover various topics related to food safety. The report describes key FDA programs addressed in bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, and more. FDA's authority to collect user fees under PDUFA will expire in 2007 without reauthorization. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) provides FDA with revenue from pharmaceutical manufacturers to speed up the review process for new products. Without reauthorization, PDUFA will expire in 2007. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) established a mechanism for agency-industry collaboration to set performance goals for review times. PDUFA led to decreased application review times and increased premarket review activities. Reauthorizations in 1997 and 2002 gave FDA limited authority to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for a 2007 reauthorization focused on postmarket drug safety. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, reauthorizing assessment, collection, and use of application, establishment, and product fees. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focuses on postmarket drug safety. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, reauthorizing fees for applications, establishment, and products. They expand postmarket safety activities, including adverse event data collection and reporting requirements to the HHS Secretary and the public. Fee revenues for each fiscal year would be $393 million. Both the Senate and House bills aim to enhance postmarket drug safety by increasing adverse event reporting requirements to the HHS Secretary and the public. They both propose fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments for inflation and workload. The House bill includes exemptions for orphan drugs marketed by smaller companies and authorizes fees for drug advertisement reviews. The House bill exempts orphan drugs from certain fees for companies with less than $100 million in revenue. Both bills propose new fees for drug advertisement reviews, with voluntary pre-release reviews and advisory FDA responses. The Senate bill includes core elements of the prescription drug user fee program and requires annual reports to Congress. The Senate bill proposes codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation with various stakeholders for PDUFA reauthorization. It also includes a public hearing and review of the Secretary's recommendations for setting performance goals. The Senate bill proposes codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation with various stakeholders for PDUFA reauthorization. It includes a public hearing and review of the Secretary's recommendations for setting performance goals. The House bill would also require public availability of negotiation minutes before presenting recommendations to Congress. User fees were introduced into the medical device review process. The House bill requires public availability of negotiation minutes before presenting recommendations to Congress. User fees were introduced into the medical device review process by the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002. This act established user fees for premarket reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and instituted new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority for collecting user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for premarket reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new regulations for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress through bills like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. The FDA has the authority to collect user fees from medical device manufacturers seeking approval, set to expire on October 1, 2007. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012, with provisions for fee amounts, fee increases, and new types of fees. Government entities are exempt from certain fees, and the Secretary could increase fees under certain conditions. Both bills would extend the exemption of government entities from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 also including Indian tribes. The Secretary could increase the fee amount under certain conditions, and both bills would extend the requirement for medical device-related appropriations until FY2012. Fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 would be considered in aggregate, with any excess fees subtracted from the subsequent year's collection. Both bills propose changes to fee collection for medical devices to meet performance goals. They would amend the provision on excess fees collected, considering them in aggregate between FY2008 and FY2011. A reduction in fees would only occur if the total collected exceeded the authorized amount for that period. H.R. 2900 also authorizes specific appropriations for postmarket safety reviews. The bills eliminate the Secretary's ability to adjust premarket notification fees annually but maintain a reference to this provision. Both bills address reduced or refunded fees.

They would amend the provision on excess fees collected, considering them in aggregate between FY2008 and FY2011. H.R. 2900 also authorizes specific appropriations for postmarket safety reviews. The bills eliminate the Secretary's ability to adjust premarket notification fees annually but maintain a reference to this provision. Both bills address reduced or refunded fees, with additional provisions for small businesses and foreign firms to qualify. Refund policies for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action are also specified. The bills propose changes to fee collection for medical devices to meet performance goals. They specify a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action. The Secretary would have sole authority for refund decisions, and annual reports would be required through FY2012. H.R. 2900 includes information on postmarket safety activities in reports, while S. 1082 requires information on previous cohorts of medical device applications to be made public. Both bills mandate FDA consultation with various groups for performance goal recommendations. The bills, H.R. 2900 and S. 1082, propose changes to fee collection for medical devices to meet performance goals. They require FDA consultation with various groups for performance goal recommendations and specify procedures for public input and revision of recommendations. H.R. 2900's user fee provisions take effect upon enactment, while S. 1082's provisions become effective on October 1, 2007 with a savings clause for fee collection continuity. Both bills also include amendments related to medical device regulation. The user fee provisions in S. 1082 would take effect upon enactment, while H.R. 2900's provisions would become effective on October 1, 2007. Both bills include amendments related to medical device regulation, with H.R. 2900 requiring a study on nosocomial infections. Additionally, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would extend the authority for third-party review of premarket notifications and revise requirements for inspections by accredited third parties. The bills aim to streamline the requirements for third-party review of premarket notifications and inspections by accredited third parties. They propose reducing administrative burdens, expanding participation, and allowing device companies to submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards. The bills also seek to limit the registration period for device producers and reduce the frequency of registration requirements. The bills aim to streamline registration requirements for device producers, restricting the registration period to between October 1 and December 31 of each year. They also propose electronic filing as a default, with S. 1082 requiring feasibility of electronic information receipt. FDA has approved products for adult use without testing in children, leading to off-label use in younger patients. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies due to the unique effects and variations in drug metabolism in children. This aims to address the off-label prescribing of adult-approved drugs to children, which can lead to ineffective treatment or inappropriate dosing. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by providing market exclusivity incentives. It also requires pediatric studies for off-patent drugs to assess safety and effectiveness, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) requires pediatric studies for off-patent drugs to assess safety and effectiveness, with NIH funding. It also reauthorized exclusivity provisions for on-patent drugs and gave FDA authority to mandate pediatric testing data submission. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) was enacted in 2003 to mandate pediatric testing data submission for new drug applications. It covers drugs and biological products, includes provisions for deferrals, waivers, and required pediatric assessments. PREA remains in effect as long as the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) is authorized, which is set to expire in 2007. Reauthorization of BPCA for another five years is proposed in bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling change requirements. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) mandates pediatric testing data submission for new drug applications. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorizing the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling change requirements. The bills also aim to expand FDA's authority under PREA for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. Key differences include the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 reducing it to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand FDA's authority under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. S. 1082 would reduce the exclusivity period to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales, while H.R. 2900 would leave it unchanged. Additionally, H.R. 2900 eliminates the provision tying PREA's authorities to the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) authorization, whereas S. 1082 maintains that connection. Both bills also include legislation to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007, incorporated in both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, aims to amend the FFDCA by modifying the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products for small patient populations. This exemption allows manufacturers to market products without proving effectiveness, benefiting patients with rare diseases. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 aims to amend the FFDCA by modifying the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products for small patient populations. The legislation would exempt manufacturers of pediatric devices for small populations from the general HDE prohibition on selling a device for an amount that exceeds its costs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would extend the new exemption through 2012 and 2013 respectively. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the new exemption for pediatric medical devices through 2012 and 2013 respectively. Both bills require funding for research on pediatric medical devices and the establishment of a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. Additionally, H.R. 2900 mandates the FDA Commissioner to submit a plan for expanding pediatric medical device research and development to relevant congressional committees. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose establishing a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. The bills focus on connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing device development, and providing business assistance. They also require coordination with NIH and FDA, with S. 1082 mandating grantees to report annually. Both bills authorize $6 million for FY2008 through FY2012 and expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics to include pediatric medical devices. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 authorize $6 million annually for a demonstration project promoting pediatric device development. They expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics to include pediatric medical devices and require postmarket surveillance measures for pediatric medical devices. The bills would expand the Secretary's authority to require postmarket studies for pediatric medical devices with safety controls. H.R. 2900 includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. Since 1938, new drug manufacturers have had to demonstrate product safety to FDA before approval for marketing in the U.S. The dispute resolution provision allows manufacturers to request a review without the device being deemed misbranded, focusing on product safety and effectiveness requirements since the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of any drug due to rare adverse effects or unrecognized drug-associated conditions. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of any drug due to rare adverse effects or unrecognized drug-associated conditions. FDA considers if a drug is safe enough when used correctly for tested diseases. Researchers found some widely used drugs to be more dangerous than expected, raising concerns about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety issues. FDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to investigate. Some believed that widely used drugs were more dangerous than expected, leading to concerns about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety issues. FDA requested the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to examine its handling of drug safety, resulting in a 2006 report that addressed organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Consumers, health experts, and Members of Congress sought ways to enhance FDA's actions to protect the public, reflected in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, which would establish new authorities and expand existing ones for FDA to identify and correct postmarket drug safety problems. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's actions to protect the public by establishing new authorities and expanding existing ones to identify and correct postmarket drug safety problems. Public-private partnerships would be required to develop a postmarket risk identification system using electronic databases. FDA currently recommends postmarket studies for products on the market. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. The House and Senate bills propose the authorization for the Secretary to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drug or biologic applications. The House bill focuses on pre-approval criteria to ensure benefits outweigh risks, while the Senate bill requires REMS based on serious risk signals to assess or mitigate risks. The Senate bill proposes giving the Secretary authority to require a REMS for drugs based on serious risk signals, including new indications and generic products. REMS would include core elements and could involve patient instructions, distribution restrictions, and monitoring. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies would be allowed. Both the Senate bill and the House bill propose implementing REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) for drugs, including core elements like patient instructions, distribution restrictions, and monitoring. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies would be allowed. The bills also outline procedures for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, enforcement, and reviews of approved REMS at specified times. H.R. 2900 and the Senate bill propose adding authority for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement for REMS. They require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board. The bills also authorize the Secretary to require postapproval studies or clinical trials. The bills propose evaluating REMS elements for safe drug use and potential burdens on the healthcare system. They differ on criteria for postapproval studies, with the Senate bill focusing on serious risks and unexpected patterns, while the House bill authorizes studies based on known risks. The House bill authorizes the Secretary to require postapproval studies to assess known risks, signals of serious risk, or identify a serious risk, outside of the REMS process. It also sets up a process for disputes between sponsors and the Secretary regarding labeling changes. The House bill sets up a multi-level process for disputes between sponsors and the Secretary regarding labeling changes, with defined time limits and involvement of the Drug Safety Oversight Board. If disagreements persist, the Secretary may deem the drug misbranded. Both bills include time limits and dispute resolution procedures for labeling changes and authorize the Secretary to require submission of certain advertisements for review before dissemination. Both the House and Senate bills include time limits and dispute resolution procedures for labeling changes, as well as provisions for the Secretary to review certain advertisements before dissemination. Both bills also allow the Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties for violations, with fines of up to $250,000 per violation and up to $1 million for violations adjudicated in a single proceeding. Both the House and Senate bills would give the FDA the authority to impose civil monetary penalties for violations of REMS requirements. Fines could range from $250,000 to $1 million per violation, with additional penalties for ongoing violations or threats to public health. Non-compliant drugs could be considered misbranded, and sponsors would be prohibited from marketing products with REMS if not in compliance. The House and Senate bills propose fines of up to $1 million per day for sponsors who violate REMS requirements, with additional penalties for ongoing violations. Non-compliant drugs could be deemed misbranded, and sponsors would be barred from marketing products with REMS if not in compliance. Both bills also establish civil penalty authority for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads, with fines ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 for the House bill and $150,000 to $300,000 for the Senate bill. Increased appropriations would support drug safety provisions. The Senate bill proposes lower fines for violations, with fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation and up to $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill increasing revenue by $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012. The House bill authorizes appropriations of $125 million for a five-year period and requires guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs. The House bill authorizes $125 million over five years for drug safety activities, including guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs and grants for orphan drug development. The Senate bill designates antibiotics as orphan products, authorizing $35 million annually for their development and providing incentives for certain antibiotics. The Senate bill designates antibiotics as orphan products and authorizes $35 million annually for their development. It includes provisions for antibiotic access, innovation, and packaging requirements for prescription drugs. The House bill focuses on drug safety activities, including guidance for clinical trials and grants for orphan drug development. The House bill focuses on drug safety provisions, including requirements for DTC ads to include a statement encouraging reporting of adverse effects to the FDA. The Senate bill includes provisions for establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and maintaining a website with extensive drug safety information. The Senate bill proposes the establishment of an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and the development of a website with comprehensive drug safety information. It also mandates that state-legalized medical marijuana adhere to FDA regulations and awards priority review vouchers for neglected or tropical disease products. Additionally, the FDA Commissioner would be required to publish a list of authorized generic drugs on the FDA website. The Senate bill proposes awarding priority review vouchers to sponsors of new drugs, which can be transferred to another sponsor. The FDA Commissioner must publish a list of authorized generic drugs and prevent delays from citizen petitions. Clinical trial registration requirements were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) established clinical trial registration requirements for drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding the types of trials and information in the registry, requiring registration of most clinical trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding clinical trial registration requirements to include most trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays the public release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements. Both bills link certain requirements to the trial completion date. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose expanding clinical trial registration requirements to include most trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 links certain requirements to the trial completion date and requires the responsible party to comply with provisions. It also mandates that a principal investigator have control over the data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. Both bills would expand the type of information in the registry, make it searchable, and prohibit false or misleading information. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 both aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements for drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 specifies that the principal investigator must have control over data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. Both bills require accurate and searchable information in the registry, with H.R. 2900 adding disclosure of agreements restricting non-employees from discussing or publishing trial results. Updates must be submitted every six months until trial results are in the database. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 both aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements for drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 adds criteria such as disclosure of agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results and specific instructions for creating a results database. S. 1082 specifies additional criteria for the searchable registry and a timeline for making registry information public. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for creating a public database of clinical trial results, while S. 1082 requires the Secretary to establish a database based on NIH recommendations. H.R. 2900 specifies searchable categories, timing of submissions, and accuracy of information, with a focus on non-promotional content. H.R. 2900 requires truthful and regularly updated submissions for a public database of clinical trial results. The bill mandates that pre-approval study results be made public within 30 days of certain events, such as receiving a not substantially equivalent (NSE) letter from the Secretary regarding a medical device. The issuance of an NSE letter for a medical device does not necessarily conclude an FDA application. Timing provisions could lead to the public disclosure of clinical trial information for pending FDA actions. A provision for new drug or device uses allows for a posting delay if a new use filing is imminent. Both bills have coordination, compliance, and enforcement provisions, with H.R. 2900 covering registry and results database requirements, while S. 1082 focuses on registry provisions. The manufacturer certified to the Secretary that a filing with FDA for a new use would soon be made. Both bills include coordination, compliance, and enforcement provisions. H.R. 2900's compliance provisions apply to registry and results database requirements, while S. 1082 focuses only on registry provisions. H.R. 2900 contains provisions regarding enforcement of results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database, prohibiting noncompliant trials. S. 1082 requires FDA applications to certify registry requirement compliance. One controversial provision dropped from H.R. 2900 specified that the act would not affect causes of action for damages under state law. S. 1082 would amend FDA requirements to include penalties for noncompliance with registry requirements, with a $10,000 penalty for first violations and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. This is in contrast to H.R. 2900, which would allow penalties of $10,000 per day, capped at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address penalties for noncompliance with FDA requirements. S. 1082 would amend relevant sections and impose a $10,000 penalty for first violations and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. H.R. 2900, on the other hand, would not amend FFDCA sections and allows penalties of $10,000 per day, capped at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits. Both bills also include provisions regarding conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The FDA's approach to conflicts of interest in advisory committees requires disclosure and possible abstention from voting. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting for advisory committees, expanding requirements to cover all topics and defining financial interests under 18 U.S.C. 208(a). The entity advises the Secretary on FDA activities and defines financial interests under 18 U.S.C. 208(a), covering employment, trusteeship, and directorship. Stock ownership, former employment, and grants are not included, but disclosure is required. An alternative definition in 21 U.S.C. 355(n) requires disclosure for drug and biologics committees. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on recruiting experts from academia and medical research institutions for advisory committees. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on recruiting experts from academia and medical research institutions for advisory committees. They require full financial disclosure from committee members and discourage financial conflict waivers. Non-voting guest experts with financial interests may participate if deemed necessary by the Secretary. Voting by members with conflicts of interest is precluded unless exempted by the Office of Government Ethics. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 require full financial disclosure from advisory committee members and restrict voting by members with conflicts of interest. The Secretary can allow a waiver for essential expertise, with limits on the number of waivers per meeting. Public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers are mandated, along with annual reports on advisory committee membership and conflict-of-interest waivers. The bills also require the Secretary to update FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 mandate full financial disclosure and restrict voting for advisory committee members with conflicts of interest. They require the Secretary to update FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years and establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission. The corporation's board would include representatives from various organizations and coordinate with federal programs.
