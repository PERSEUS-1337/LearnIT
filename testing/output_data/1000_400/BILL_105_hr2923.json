    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\". The Act aims to establish early detection and intervention networks for hearing loss in babies, including screening before leaving the hospital, within the first 3 months of life for non-hospital births, and timely diagnostic testing before 6 months of age. Babies not born in hospitals should be screened within the first 3 months of life. Diagnostic audiologic testing should be done promptly for appropriate referral before 6 months. Universal newborn hearing screening programs should ensure linkage to diagnosis and early intervention services. Public policy on early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention should consider unique needs of deaf or hard-of-hearing infants and involve consultation with relevant sectors. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes developing state capacity, monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, and ensuring effective screening and referral services. The grants aim to develop universal newborn hearing detection programs in hospitals and nonhospital birthing sites, create statewide models for effective screening and referral, and collect data for research and policy development. SEC. 4. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND APPLIED RESEARCH. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures for quality monitoring, cost-effectiveness studies, and identifying causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention programs. This includes studying costs and effectiveness, identifying causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss, assessing the effectiveness of early detection and treatment programs, and promoting data sharing for identifying unknown causes of hearing loss. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss, including clinical trials and intervention studies. Data sharing with State-based monitoring programs will help identify unknown causes of hearing loss. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, professionals proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing language, and other health and education professionals. The professional personnel proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing language possess specialized knowledge to serve infants, children, and families. The administrators collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection and intervention at federal, state, and private sector levels. State networks focus on early detection, diagnosis, and intervention. Health professionals collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection and intervention at federal, state, and private sector levels. State networks focus on establishing early detection, diagnosis, and intervention systems. Authorization of appropriations for early hearing detection and intervention programs. Authorization of appropriations for early hearing detection and intervention programs includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, funding for technical assistance, data management, and research is allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. For the National Institutes of Health, $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary funds for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out section 4(b)."
