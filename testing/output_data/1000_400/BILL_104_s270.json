The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as 'alien terrorist', 'classified information', 'national security', 'special court', and 'special removal hearing'. The provisions of this section apply when the Attorney General certifies to the special court. The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" outlines the procedures for special removal hearings for alien terrorists in the United States. The Attorney General must certify to a special court that an alien terrorist is present in the country and that deportation proceedings would risk national security by disclosing classified information. The Chief Justice of the United States oversees the special court. The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" establishes a special court with up to seven designated judges to hear cases involving the deportation of alien terrorists. The Chief Justice of the United States has the authority to designate these judges, and the special court procedures are invoked when deportation proceedings would risk national security by revealing classified information. The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" establishes a special court with designated judges to hear deportation cases involving alien terrorists. The Chief Justice can designate these judges, and special court procedures are invoked when deportation proceedings risk national security by revealing classified information. The Attorney General can make an application to a single judge of the special court in camera and ex parte if there is probable cause to believe the identified alien poses a risk in deportation proceedings. The special removal hearing, based on probable cause, allows for public access and the presence of the alien if their physical presence poses an immediate threat of death or serious harm. The special removal hearing, based on probable cause, allows for public access, the presence of the alien, legal representation, introduction of evidence, and cross-examination of witnesses. The alien in a special removal hearing has the right to introduce evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and request subpoenas. The judge can allow the introduction of classified evidence in camera if public disclosure poses a national security risk. The judge must provide the alien with a substitution for classified evidence. In a special removal hearing, the judge may provide the alien with a substitution for evidence if its disclosure poses a risk of harm to any person. In a special removal hearing, the judge may provide the alien with a substitution for evidence if its disclosure poses a risk of harm to any person. If the judge determines that the substituted evidence will allow the alien to make their defense or that even the substituted evidence would pose a risk of harm, deportation may be determined under this section. In a special removal hearing, if there is a substantial risk of harm to any person, deportation may be determined under this section. The judge will require deportation if the Attorney General proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is subject to deportation. The alien may be deported if the Attorney General proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that he is subject to deportation as described in section 241(a)(4)(B). Appeals can be made to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days of the determination. The Attorney General can appeal a determination under subsections (d), (e), or (f) to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit by filing a notice of appeal within twenty days. Upon request, the entire record of the proceeding can be transmitted to the court of appeals under seal for consideration in camera and ex parte."
