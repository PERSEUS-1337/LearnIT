    "content": "Congress's contempt power is used to respond to acts that obstruct the legislative process, such as a witness refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance, including the authority to detain and imprison a contemnor until they comply. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance with a subpoena: inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance, criminal contempt permits certification for prosecution, and serves as punishment without necessarily encouraging compliance. The contempt statute allows Congress to certify a contempt citation for criminal prosecution of the contemnor who fails to comply with a congressional subpoena. Criminal contempt serves as punishment but may not lead to compliance. Congress can also seek civil enforcement through the judicial branch to ensure compliance with subpoenas, especially for executive branch officials. The report discusses Congress's contempt power and enforcement of subpoenas, including legal obligations, contempt of court consequences, civil enforcement for executive branch officials, and obstacles in enforcing contempt actions. For a more detailed version, refer to CRS Report RL34097. The power of Congress to enforce contempt actions against executive branch officials is closely tied to its authority to investigate. Congress has broad authority to obtain information, including confidential details, essential for its legislative function. While not explicitly stated in the Constitution or specific statutes, the Supreme Court has recognized Congress's implied power to conduct oversight and investigations. The Supreme Court has firmly established Congress's broad legislative authority to conduct oversight and investigations, including the power to enforce informational demands. This power was established in Supreme Court rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as essential to the legislative function. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's authority to conduct oversight and investigations, emphasizing the importance of the power of inquiry to the legislative function. This power allows Congress to obtain necessary information through enforcement processes when voluntary disclosure is insufficient. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's authority to conduct oversight and investigations, emphasizing the importance of the power of inquiry to the legislative function. It has been taught that compulsion is essential to obtain accurate information, as voluntary disclosure may not always be complete. The constitutional provisions commit the legislative function to the two houses, including the power of inquiry with enforcing process. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress in Sinclair v. United States, rejecting the excuse of pending lawsuits for withholding information. The Court affirmed Congress's authority for oversight and investigations, emphasizing the power of inquiry in the legislative function. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress in Sinclair v. United States, emphasizing Congress's broad investigative authority and rejecting the excuse of pending lawsuits for withholding information. The Supreme Court has consistently affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is as penetrating and far-reaching as its power to enact laws. This power includes inquiries into the administration of existing laws and potential new statutes. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is inherent in the legislative process and encompasses inquiries into existing laws and potential new statutes. Congress's investigative power is at its peak when addressing waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments, allowing probes into corruption, inefficiency, or waste. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is inherent in the legislative process and encompasses inquiries into corruption, inefficiency, or waste within government departments. Congress's inherent contempt power is considered necessary for effective investigation and legislation. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to inquire into and publicize corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in government agencies. This power was upheld by the Supreme Court in Anderson v. Dunn and McGrain v. Daugherty. Individuals can be brought before Congress, tried, and imprisoned as punishment or coercion until they comply. The House can imprison a witness for contempt either as punishment or coercion, following traditional methods like in Anderson v. Dunn where a non-Member was arrested for bribery. In 1818, a non-Member, Anderson, was accused of bribery by a Member of the House of Representatives. The House resolution led to Anderson's arrest by the Sergeant-at-Arms and his appearance before the House to answer the charges. Anderson was granted counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. After a resolution finding him guilty of contempt, the Speaker reprimanded him and discharged him from custody. This established the pattern of attachment, appearance before the bar, and provision for defense in such cases. The House found a non-Member guilty of contempt for bribery, leading to his arrest and appearance before the bar. The process included provision for defense, identification of charges, and a resolution for penalty. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus could be sought to ensure due process standards were met. In a habeas proceeding, the court decides if the House or Senate acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were followed in contempt proceedings. While not all procedural rights of criminal proceedings are required, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be given. The courts may require certain standards, like pertinency of questions, under the due process clause for inherent contempt proceedings. Monetary fines could be imposed instead of incarceration. The due process clause may require pertinency of questions in inherent contempt proceedings. Imposing monetary fines instead of incarceration could avoid habeas corpus proceedings. Congress could argue for fines based on courts' authority to impose fines for contemptuous behavior. Support for this argument can be found in dicta from a 1821 Supreme Court decision. Support for Congress imposing fines instead of incarceration can be found in dicta from the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson. The Court questioned the extent of punishing power of deliberative assemblies and suggested imprisonment as the least possible power adequate to the end proposed. Other inflictions were seen as mere commutation for confinement. The Supreme Court suggested in Kilbourn v. Thompson that Congress may compel testimony using the same means as a court of justice in certain cases. Punishment by fine or imprisonment is limited to cases where testimony is required in a matter within the House's jurisdiction. The Supreme Court indicated that Congress can compel testimony similar to a court of justice, with punishment by fine or imprisonment only applicable when testimony is needed in a matter under the House's jurisdiction. Inherent contempt allows the House or Senate to conduct proceedings independently and cite offenders without external branch assistance, with the option for the contemnor to seek judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus. Inherent contempt allows the House or Senate to independently conduct proceedings and cite offenders without external branch assistance. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus, but imprisonment cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. However, inherent contempt is seen as cumbersome, time-consuming, and relatively ineffective for a modern Congress with a heavy legislative workload. Inherent contempt allows Congress to independently cite offenders, but imprisonment cannot extend beyond the current session. The process is seen as cumbersome and relatively ineffective for a modern Congress with a heavy legislative workload. The last time it was used was in 1935. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 considered successful in meting out punishment, obtaining testimony, or producing documents. These proceedings were seen as time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes ineffective due to the trial process at the bar of the chamber concerned. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as a result of a particular proceeding in the House of Representatives that year. This procedure allows for a judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney, serving as an alternative to the inherent contempt process. The statutory criminal contempt procedure enacted in 1857 allows for a judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney, serving as an alternative to the inherent contempt process. Most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than through criminal contempt methods in the two decades following its enactment. The statutory provisions 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194 allow for criminal prosecution of witnesses who fail to testify or produce documents, with penalties of up to $100,000 fine and one year imprisonment. Section 194 outlines the procedure for referring a witness to the courts for prosecution, including committee approval. Section 194 outlines the procedure for referring a recalcitrant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution, involving committee approval, House or Senate approval of a resolution, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney. This process is punitive and aims to deter similar conduct in the future. The criminal contempt statute is punitive and aims to punish witnesses who refuse to cooperate, deterring others from similar conduct. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas has led to the House not pursuing further proceedings. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. The House has certified to the U.S. Attorney that further proceedings concerning contempts were not necessary in some cases. It is unclear whether the U.S. Attorney's duty to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary. The U.S. Attorney's duty to bring contempt matters before the grand jury is unclear, with conflicting guidance from relevant case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the court ordered the release of witnesses held in contempt by a committee for not following mandatory procedures. The court ordered the release of witnesses held in contempt by a committee for not following mandatory procedures, as prescribed by Congress. The Speaker of the House or the President of the Senate must certify the facts to the district attorney, leaving no discretion in the matter. The Speaker of the House or the President of the Senate must certify the facts to the district attorney, leaving no discretion in the matter. The district attorney is required to submit the facts to the grand jury, as mandated by the statute. The district court stated that the U.S. Attorney must bring contempt citations before the grand jury. However, the Court of Appeals found that the Speaker's duty to certify contempt citations during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. Congress requires approval by the parent body for a committee's contempt resolution when in session, and the Speaker or President reviews it when Congress is not in session. The court ruled that a committee's contempt resolution must be approved by the parent body when Congress is in session, and by the Speaker or President when Congress is not in session. The review process may involve discretionary decisions, as seen in the case of Wilson where convictions were reversed due to the Speaker not exercising his discretion in certifying contempt citations. This suggests that the U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary, contrary to previous court conclusions. The court ruled that the Speaker's duty in certifying contempt citations is discretionary, which may suggest that the U.S. Attorney's function is also discretionary. U.S. Attorneys typically have broad prosecutorial discretion, even when statutes use mandatory language. Congress can turn to the judicial branch for enforcement of a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement, where a house or committee can sue in federal court to compel compliance. Congress can appeal to the judicial branch for enforcement of a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement, where a house or committee can sue in federal court to compel compliance. The Senate has statutory authority for civil enforcement, while the House has pursued it through an authorizing resolution. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate as an alternative to inherent contempt power and criminal contempt statutes. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate as an alternative to inherent contempt power and criminal contempt statutes. The statute gives the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over a civil action to enforce, secure a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of, or to prevent a threatened failure or refusal to comply with, any subpoena or order issued by the Senate or a committee. The Senate has the authority to enforce compliance with subpoenas or orders through a two-step process, involving seeking a declaration of validity before court enforcement. The decision to use this process lies with the Senate, and the court will review the subpoena's validity before taking further action. The Senate has the authority to enforce compliance with subpoenas through a two-step process, involving seeking a declaration of validity before court enforcement. The court's jurisdiction is limited to aiding Congress in enforcing the subpoena, and it cannot enjoin the congressional proceeding. If the court orders compliance with the subpoena and the individual refuses, they may be tried. The court can only refuse to issue an order instructing compliance with the subpoena, but if compliance is still refused, the individual may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when it comes to subpoenas issued to federal government officers or employees. The House of Representatives may not use the Senate's civil enforcement statute, but past precedent suggests they can authorize a committee to seek civil actions. The House of Representatives can authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to force compliance with a subpoena, even though the jurisdiction of federal courts over such claims is uncertain. In a 2008 case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers, the House attempted to enforce a subpoena in federal court solely through a resolution of a single house. The House of Representatives authorized a committee to pursue civil enforcement action to enforce a subpoena, as seen in the case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The federal courts' jurisdiction over such claims was uncertain, but a 2012 decision confirmed that jurisdiction could be established if the congressional committee representative is specifically authorized by a house of Congress. Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. The committee filed a lawsuit seeking compliance with subpoenas, which was rejected by the court in 2013. The committee filed a lawsuit in 2012 to enforce subpoenas against the Attorney General. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss in 2013 and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has yet to decide on the executive privilege question. The court has denied motions for summary judgment from both parties and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents, describing why each document is privileged. The court has not yet addressed the executive privilege question. It appears that authorization from the full House is needed for civil enforcement of subpoenas, as courts will not entertain civil motions without it. It seems that courts will not consider civil motions without authorization from the full House for Congress or its committees. If an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained, the court may allow civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. The DOJ prefers civil enforcement for subpoenas against executive officials, but the executive branch argues that Congress cannot use its contempt authority against them. The executive branch prefers civil enforcement for subpoenas against executive officials, but argues that Congress cannot use its contempt authority against them. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys to refrain from pursuing criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases. This view is supported by DOJ opinions from the mid-1980s. The DOJ has directed U.S. Attorneys to refrain from pursuing criminal contempt prosecutions under certain sections. This has been evidenced in past cases where the DOJ declined to prosecute officials for contempt, leading Congress to rely on civil enforcement through federal courts to enforce subpoenas. The DOJ has declined to prosecute officials for criminal contempt, leading Congress to seek other avenues, such as civil enforcement through federal courts, to enforce subpoenas. This was seen in the 2014 case involving IRS official Lois Lerner, where the House held her in contempt for refusing to testify about allegations of targeting conservative groups. The House held Ms. Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about IRS targeting of conservative groups. Despite the House's approval, the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against her. The House approved a contempt citation against Ms. Lerner for refusing to testify about IRS targeting of conservative groups. The DOJ has not taken any action to pursue a criminal case against her, citing her personal constitutional privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. Unlike past cases involving executive privilege, this dispute does not involve such privileges. The DOJ did not pursue a criminal case against Lerner for refusing to testify about IRS targeting of conservative groups, citing her Fifth Amendment privilege. This situation differs from past cases involving executive privilege. Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials through criminal contempt. Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials through criminal contempt, especially when the President directs or endorses noncompliance with subpoenas. The DOJ may not pursue prosecution in such cases, citing prosecutorial discretion. The President's decision to assert executive privilege may prevent prosecution for criminal contempt by the DOJ. Prosecutorial discretion could be used to avoid forwarding contempt citations to a grand jury. However, if an executive branch official acts against congressional subpoenas without presidential endorsement, criminal contempt could still be used to punish them. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority in using the criminal contempt statute against the executive branch. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute an official for contempt, either due to the merit of the citation or to avoid setting a precedent. Congress's ability to enforce subpoenas through civil action may be inadequate to protect its prerogatives, as seen in the Miers case. The Miers case highlighted the inadequacy of using civil action to enforce congressional subpoenas, as the lengthy appeals process and change in administrations can diminish the committee's ability to utilize the information obtained. The Miers case, which was dismissed after 19 months, showed the limitations of relying on the executive branch or civil enforcement to enforce subpoenas. Congress can still use its inherent contempt authority to enforce subpoenas."
