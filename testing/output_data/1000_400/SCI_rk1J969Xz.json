    "content": "Estimating image location solely based on image contents is challenging due to contextual complexities. This research introduces a novel global meshing strategy and training procedures to improve geolocation inference models. Delaunay triangles are shown to be effective for geolocation in low volume scenarios. In this work, Delaunay triangles are highlighted as an effective mesh type for geolocation in low volume scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art models using quad trees with significantly less training data. Incorporating additional information such as posting time and user metadata can improve geolocation accuracy by up to 11% for country-level and 3% for city-level localities. Advancements in deep learning have expanded the capabilities of machine learning beyond image classification. Recent methods allow for deeper analysis of contextual information in images, enabling researchers to ask more complex questions like determining the geographic location of a picture. However, estimating the origin of ground-level images is challenging due to uneven distribution of images with geographic information, complicating model design. The work focuses on content-based image geolocation, identifying the geographic origin of ground-level images. Challenges include uneven distribution of geo-tagged images, conflicting data, and ambiguity in geographic terms. The work presented focuses on content-based image geolocation, identifying the geographic origin of ground-level images. With the rise of image-based social media platforms, inferring geographic context from images without explicit geolocation information has become a significant challenge. The paper discusses challenges in geolocating images without explicit geolocation information, citing the unreliability of geolocation data from social media. Various approaches, including global geolocation from ground-based imagery, are explored, with a reference to a review by Brejcha & \u010cad\u00edk (2017). The paper builds on recent work in global geolocation from ground-based imagery, utilizing a multi-class approach with one-hot encoding. Instance-level scene retrieval is used for geolocation by querying previously geotagged imagery. Prior work includes data sampling strategies for large-scale classification problems in social media applications. The curr_chunk discusses the use of feature maps for mesh-based classifiers in scene retrieval, with a focus on biased class selection during training of deep learning models. Sampling strategies for large-scale classification in social media applications are also explored, including weighted sampling of minority classes and random image regularization. The approach involves selecting images in epochs completely at random, without respect to the user. Researchers in Kordopatis-Zilos et al. (2016) address concerns regarding social media geolocation, focusing on sampling strategies and different models for image content geolocation. The study introduces three models: purely geolocation for image content (M1), models incorporating time information (M2), and models using user-album inputs (M3). The research highlights the importance of considering alternative approaches for geolocation and the use of time and user information to enhance accuracy. The study introduces three models for image content geolocation: M1 focuses on purely geolocation, M2 incorporates time information, and M3 uses user-album inputs. Data was collected from YFCC100M BID17 and training/validation was done on a subset of geolabeled imagery. User-id and posted-time are important metadata associated with every YFCC100M image. The study introduces three models for image content geolocation: M1 focuses on purely geolocation, M2 incorporates time information, and M3 uses user-album inputs. Data from YFCC100M BID17 was used for training/validation. Each YFCC100M image has user-id and posted-time metadata. The global-scale geolocation model is similar to PlaNet BID19's classification approach, subdividing the globe into a grid for classification regions. An image classifier is trained based on the true GPS location and time of posting. The global-scale geolocation model described in this work follows a classification approach similar to PlaNet BID19, dividing the globe into a grid for classification regions. An image classifier is trained based on true GPS location and time of posting, showing that the prior distribution for image longitude differs by the time of day an image is posted. For example, it would require less evidence to predict a longitude near zero for an image posted at 01:00 UTC compared to 21:00 UTC due to observed priors. The global-scale geolocation model uses a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture for classification, different from PlaNet's quad-tree mesh. The triangular mesh adapts to Earth's geometric features, aiming to improve accuracy in predicting image longitudes based on prior distribution and time of posting. The Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture in the global-scale geolocation model aims to improve accuracy in predicting image longitudes. Unlike PlaNet's quad-tree mesh, the triangular mesh is more adaptive to Earth's geometric features and can easily capture water/land interfaces without additional refinement. Cells are adaptively refined based on a set limit or dropped from classification to control mesh refinement. The structured quad-tree approach allows for control over mesh granularity by adaptively refining cells based on a set limit or dropping them from classification. Mesh initialization parameters were not explored, with each mesh initialized with a 31 x 31 structured grid. The geolocation classification mesh can be adjusted by modifying the refinement level to control the number of cells in each mesh cell. The mesh for coarse and fine classification models was initialized with a 31 x 31 structured grid. The geolocation classification mesh can be tuned by adjusting the refinement level to control the number of cells in each mesh cell. Different meshing parameters were used for the three meshes studied in this work, covering a range of structures. The fine P mesh aimed to replicate PlaNet's parameters but with a different methodology and dataset. The fine mesh classification structure in this study, generated with a different methodology and dataset, shows better representation of geographic regions compared to the coarse mesh. The fine mesh highlights natural boundaries like the water/land interface of Spain and Portugal, while the coarse mesh lacks fidelity to these boundaries. The fine mesh, generated with all available imagery, better represents geographic regions like the water/land interface of Spain and Portugal. The Inception v4 neural network architecture is used to develop the mesh-based geolocation model, which differs from previous work using Inception v3. Cells are labeled based on the cell centroid in latitudelongitude, with geolocation specified using a \"center-of-mass\" approach. The study utilizes a softmax classification similar to the PlaNet approach, with cells labeled based on the cell centroid in latitudelongitude. An alternate approach computes the \"center-of-mass\" of the training data in a containing cell for geolocation. Significant improvements are expected for coarse meshes, especially in high-density population regions. Models are evaluated by calculating the distance between predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates using great-circle distance. The study evaluates models by measuring the distance between predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates using great-circle distance. Error thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, 2500 km are used to represent different localities. Each YFCC100M image has associated metadata. The study uses error thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, 2500 km to represent different localities. Each YFCC100M image has metadata including user id and posting time, which is utilized in model M2. The one-hot encoding of images for geolocation classes is used in the model, with output N Softmax 1 indicating evidence for time dependence. The study utilizes error thresholds to represent different localities. Model M2 incorporates time dependence based on image content. Model M3 geolocates multiple images from a user using an LSTM model. Model M3 utilizes a geolocation model (M1) to filter fit probabilities from images and geolocates multiple images from a single user using an LSTM model. The Bidirectional LSTMs in M3 capitalize on correlations in a user's images, organizing them sequentially in time without further categorization. In M3, images by a single user are organized sequentially in time with no specific further organization. All user images are grouped into albums of size 24, with padding and masking used if necessary. Album averaging, as seen in PlaNet, assigns images in an album to a mesh cell based on the highest average probability, increasing accuracy by borrowing information across related images. In album averaging, images are assigned mesh cells based on highest average probability, increasing accuracy by borrowing information across related images. User images are also organized based on average probability, assuming they are from the same mesh grid cells. LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images was considered but did not significantly improve performance. The output of M1 is filtered to show only the top 10 mesh cell probabilities. In album averaging, images are assigned mesh cells based on highest average probability. LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images did not significantly improve performance. The output of M1 is filtered to show only the top 10 mesh cell probabilities, re-normalized to sum to 1. Training of M2 and M3 was only done on the validation data of M1. Meshing parameters are investigated to understand sensitivity to mesh adaptation, showing a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. A new training step is implied, with a small abuse of notation present. Meshing parameters are investigated to understand sensitivity to mesh adaptation, showing a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. Results for each mesh are shown in TAB1, demonstrating improved large granularity geolocation with the coarse mesh and better performance at finer-granularities with the fine mesh. The impact of classifying on the centroid of the training data is compared to utilizing the cell centroid for class labels, with a dramatic improvement noticed for the coarse mesh and only a modest improvement for the fine mesh. The BID20 model was used in conjunction with indoor-outdoor label delineations to filter geolocation inference only on outdoor imagery, without re-training the geolocation model on the \"outdoor\" imagery. Results from the geolocation model show a 4-8% improvement in accuracy for region/country localities, with a more modest boost in smaller-scale regions. The model was tested on Im2GPS data and showed significant improvement in performance. The geolocation model shows improved accuracy for region/country localities, with significant performance gains on Im2GPS testing data. The M1 classification model outperforms PlaNet with less training data and classification regions. Time usage enhances geolocation accuracy, with a slight increase in geolocated images within 200 km and 25 km. The coarse mesh M1 model outperforms PlaNet for large regions, with a slight increase in geolocation accuracy when using time. There is a measurable difference in error between using time (M2) and not using time (M1), which is statistically significant. The difference in error between using time (M2) and not using time (M1) is statistically significant, with a difference of 381. Time input models show lower-bias class probabilities, with a median error of 1627 km for M1 and 1262 km for M2. The distribution of errors is mean shifted, not uniformly to lower error. The median error for coarse mesh e1 is 1627 km and for e2 is 1262 km. Time input models have lower-bias class probabilities and were optimized for cross-entropy in training. KL-Divergence is calculated for each model to minimize class biases. KL-divergence of model output class frequencies compared to true class frequencies is shown in TAB5. The KL-divergence of the model output class frequencies compared to the true class frequencies in validation is shown in TAB5. \"User-Averaging\" is used as a simple method that is more accurate than predicting individual images with M1 or M2, but it introduces bias in cell count frequency. Using the average probability vector to predict a user's image may result in higher bias and improved accuracy. Albums are a better approach to borrow information across users and reduce bias in cross-entropy during training. In TAB5, the average probability vector may lead to higher bias and improved accuracy when predicting a user's image. Using albums to borrow information across users reduces bias in cross-entropy during training. LSTMs on user albums showed the lowest class bias among models considered. Table 6 compares percentage accuracy at different spatial resolutions, with Coarse and Fine Mesh models having varying triangle counts across the globe. The Coarse and Fine Mesh models have different triangle counts globally. Time information is concatenated with M1 output. Albums consist of 24 images per user-id. The best observed accuracy is in bold. Using time of day in geolocation models improves accuracy and reduces bias. Conditioning on latent variables can enhance geolocation models. Time information also improves both Coarse and Fine Mesh models (M2). Using time of day in geolocation models improves accuracy and reduces bias. Time information also enhances both Coarse and Fine Mesh models. Accounting for indoor/outdoor scenes in images explains variation in validation accuracy. Future work could involve incorporating the probability of an image being outdoor into the model input to optimize the use of time and other meta data variables. Future work could involve concatenating the probability of an image being outdoor to the input of the model M2. Increasing the granularity of a grid may reduce accuracy at the country and regional level but improve accuracy at the street and city level. Fine mesh geoinferencing is expected to perform better than a coarse mesh, especially at larger resolutions. The study compared the accuracy of fine and coarse mesh grids for geolocation at different resolutions. A coarse mesh was found to be superior for 200 km resolutions. Using a Delunary triangle-based mesh allowed for training accurate models with fewer examples. Training and validation sets were divided randomly for model training. The study compared the accuracy of fine and coarse mesh grids for geolocation at different resolutions. A coarse mesh was found to be superior for 200 km resolutions. Training models with fewer examples was achieved by dividing images into training and validation sets. Empirical training procedures were developed to overcome challenges with large meshes, showing promising results for model training. The training procedure developed for large models involved pre-training on ImageNet with Adagrad BID3, increasing training examples by 6% each epoch, oversampling minority classes, and reducing class bias after each training cycle. The final model was trained with SGD, using a linearly decreasing learning rate reduced at 4% with each epoch, without class biasing and with the full dataset per epoch. The initial value of the learning rate varied for each model (between 0.004 and 0.02). The layers of M2 are described in TAB0. M2 is trained using He initializations, initial iterations of Adaboost, followed by ADAM at learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation accuracy. The M2 model is trained using He initializations, Adaboost, and ADAM with learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation accuracy. The generality of the M1 classification model is demonstrated by performing a query-by-example on the 2K random Im2GPS dataset. The church in the image was not present in the training data or the 2K random dataset. Each image is assigned a categorical indicator variable based on its class. The latent class distribution is assumed to be constant across training, testing, and application. The last layer output from networks is a softmax model for classification distribution comparison. The KL-divergence between q and p is considered low if training is done well. The entropy of p and q is also taken into account for completeness."
