    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, but Supreme Court decisions have narrowed its protection. Congress recognized that disabilities should not hinder full participation in society. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aims to protect individuals with physical and mental impairments from discrimination and ensure their full participation in society. Congress recognized that disabilities should not prevent talented individuals from contributing due to prejudice or societal barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was modeled after the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which defined disability broadly to include actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. This broad definition was supported by a Supreme Court decision acknowledging society's myths and fears about disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 adopted a broad definition of disability, recognizing that societal perceptions and fears about disability can be as limiting as physical impairments. Congress understood that discrimination based on physical or mental impairments is often unrelated to the actual limitations caused by the impairment itself. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the term \"disability\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 has been stricter than Congress intended, leading to a narrower application of the definition. The Supreme Court has interpreted the definition of \"disability\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 strictly, narrowing its application and excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The Act aims to eliminate discrimination and establish enforceable standards. The Act aims to restore broad protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in response to Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the class of people protected from discrimination. The Act aims to restore broad protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying the definition of disability and ensuring protection for individuals facing adverse treatment based on impairment or prejudiced attitudes. The Act provides protection for individuals facing adverse treatment based on impairment, prejudiced attitudes, or societal and institutional barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 provides protection for individuals facing adverse treatment based on impairment, prejudiced attitudes, or societal and institutional barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. Individuals with disabilities have faced discrimination and unequal treatment throughout history. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to address discrimination against individuals with disabilities, emphasizing the history of unequal treatment and the need to disfavor classifications that exclude them. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED. Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define 'disability' as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment, without consideration of mitigating measures. The determination of impairment under the Americans with Disabilities Act is made without considering mitigating measures, episodic manifestations, or remission/latency of the impairment. Mitigating measures refer to any treatment. The Americans with Disabilities Act does not consider mitigating measures, episodic manifestations, or remission/latency of impairments when determining disability. Mitigating measures include treatments, medications, devices, and accommodations. The Americans with Disabilities Act defines mental and physical impairments as including various disorders and conditions affecting the body systems. Mitigating measures like treatments and medications are not considered when determining disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act defines physical impairment as any physiological disorder affecting various body systems. This includes neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and other systems. A record of a physical impairment refers to a history of such conditions. The Americans with Disabilities Act defines various body systems affected by physical impairment, including neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and others. The term 'record of a physical or mental impairment' refers to a history of or misclassification as having such impairments. The term 'regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' means being perceived or treated as having an impairment, regardless of actual presence. SEC. 5. ADVERSE ACTION.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include discrimination against individuals using mitigating measures or experiencing side effects as discrimination under this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY. ``An adverse action taken by an entity covered under this Act against an individual due to their use of a mitigating measure or its side effects constitutes discrimination under this Act. Amendments to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 broaden protection against discrimination on the basis of disability.'' SEC. 7. QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL. Section 103(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to clarify that discrimination claims must involve individuals who are not qualified individuals with a disability. SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of the Act for comprehensive prohibition of discrimination. Regulations must be issued within 180 days to implement various sections and carry out corresponding provisions. The Attorney General, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations to implement sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board will issue supplementary guidelines to supplement existing guidelines for accessible design for titles II and III of the Act. The Compliance Board will issue supplementary guidelines to supplement existing guidelines for accessible design under titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007. This does not limit the authority of other agencies to issue regulations or guidelines under different provisions of the Act. Duly issued Federal regulations and guidance for the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will be respected.
