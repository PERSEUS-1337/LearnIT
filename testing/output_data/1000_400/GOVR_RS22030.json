    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance police, judicial, and intelligence cooperation. The EU, a unique partnership of 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Harmonizing policies in \"justice and home affairs\" is a key focus, including measures to enhance internal security, protect citizens' rights, and facilitate free movement within the EU. The EU's efforts in harmonizing policies in \"justice and home affairs\" (JHA) aim to enhance internal security, protect citizens' rights, and promote free movement within the EU. JHA includes countering terrorism, cross-border crimes, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, and border control policies for the Schengen area. Initially hindered by member state concerns about national sovereignty and lack of trust among law enforcement agencies, the 2001 terrorist attacks prompted a shift towards greater cooperation in the JHA field. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted greater cooperation in the EU's justice and home affairs (JHA) policies, overcoming previous obstacles like member state concerns about national sovereignty and lack of trust among law enforcement agencies. European law enforcement efforts post-attacks led to numerous arrests in countries like Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, highlighting the need for collaboration due to the open borders and different legal systems within the EU. European leaders recognized that the EU's open borders and different legal systems facilitated terrorist movement and evasion of arrest. Most EU countries lacked anti-terrorist legislation, allowing suspects to escape by moving to countries with different laws. Extradition requests within the EU were slow, hindering the apprehension of terrorists. The EU recognized the challenges of cross-border terrorism due to open borders and varying legal systems. Efforts were made to harmonize anti-terror laws, facilitate information sharing, and expedite extradition processes to combat terrorist threats effectively. Following the 2001 attacks, the EU accelerated efforts to harmonize anti-terror laws, enhance information sharing, and streamline extradition processes. Key measures included a common definition of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to combat terrorist financing, and improved border and aviation security. Europol and Eurojust were strengthened to handle criminal intelligence and prosecutorial coordination. Subsequent incidents like the 2004 Madrid bombings further emphasized the need to bolster EU counterterrorism capabilities. Following the 2001 attacks, the EU accelerated efforts to harmonize anti-terror laws, enhance information sharing, and streamline extradition processes. Europol and Eurojust were strengthened to handle criminal intelligence and prosecutorial coordination. Subsequent incidents in Europe, such as the 2004 Madrid bombings and the 2005 London bombings, further emphasized the need to enhance EU counterterrorism capabilities. This led to initiatives to improve travel document security, impede terrorist travel, and establish a Counterterrorism Coordinator to enhance intelligence sharing among EU member states. In response to the 2005 London bombings, the EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream opinions, and enhancing security measures. The attacks raised concerns about the integration of Muslims into European society and the need to counter violent extremism. The EU adopted its first plan in 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, aiming to disrupt terrorist activities, promote mainstream opinions, and enhance security measures. Since then, the EU has expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, providing training, and public provocation to commit terrorism. This decision was made to facilitate the prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist activities and counter the dissemination of terrorist propaganda. The EU expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses like terrorist recruitment, training, and public provocation. This decision aimed to facilitate prosecution, counter terrorist propaganda, and enhance cooperation with Internet providers. The EU also established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite political commitment, forging common EU policies against terrorism remains a work in progress. The EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. However, challenges in harmonizing laws and policies across EU member states persist, with issues such as data privacy and intelligence sharing complicating cooperation. National sovereignty concerns and reluctance among some national police and intelligence services to share information hinder EU-wide efforts to address terrorism threats. EU member states struggle to harmonize laws and policies in the JHA field, hindering cooperation in addressing terrorism threats. National police and intelligence services are often reluctant to share information, complicating EU efforts to combat the threat posed by groups like the Islamic State. Concerns have been raised about European citizens joining terrorist groups in conflict zones, with up to 5,000 EU citizens estimated to have traveled to fight in Syria, Iraq, or other areas. Security services are concerned about the potential danger posed by European citizens who have traveled to fight in conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa. Up to 5,000 EU citizens are estimated to have joined terrorist groups abroad. There are fears of trained militants returning to Europe and individuals inspired by extremist propaganda carrying out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have been linked to or influenced by groups like the Islamic State. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, including those in Brussels, Paris, and Copenhagen, have raised concerns about individuals with ties to extremist groups like the Islamic State. These attacks have been carried out by European citizens who may have been influenced by radical ideologies or trained abroad. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, including those in Brussels, Paris, and Copenhagen, have raised concerns about individuals with ties to extremist groups like the Islamic State. The attacks involved French-born Muslims with possible connections to Al Qaeda in Yemen or the Islamic State. Incidents included shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, an attempted attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris, and coordinated attacks in Paris that left 130 dead. The assailants were mostly French or Belgian. The November 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. The assailants were mostly French or Belgian citizens with ties to the Islamic State in Syria-Iraq. European authorities face challenges in monitoring potential attackers and lack sufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. The EU has faced challenges in monitoring potential attackers due to weaknesses in domestic security and border controls. Insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services has also hindered efforts. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and chaos from migrant influxes. Some attackers traveled between European countries before carrying out attacks, highlighting the need for improved security measures. The train assailant and alleged Brussels gunman traveled between European countries before the attacks. The suspected ringleader of the November Paris attacks may have traveled between Europe and Syria despite being known to security services. Perpetrators entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat. Despite some progress, skepticism remains about the effectiveness of these efforts. Key steps include enhancing information sharing. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat. Despite skepticism about the effectiveness of these efforts, key steps have been taken to enhance information sharing among member states. This includes encouraging national authorities to share information on suspected foreign fighters and utilize common EU databases such as the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. Europol also launched a European Counter Terrorism Centre in January 2016 for information sharing and operational cooperation. Europol established the Focal Point Travellers database in 2013 to collect information on European fighters. In January 2016, the European Counter Terrorism Centre was launched for operational cooperation among member states. The success of these initiatives relies on information sharing from national authorities, with some experts noting shortcomings in EU-wide terrorism information sharing. The EU aims to finalize the collection of airline Passenger Name Record data for enhanced security measures. EU officials report an increase in alerts and information sharing in SIS and Europol databases. Efforts to establish an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system have been ongoing, with political pressure intensifying after the 2015 Paris attacks. The system aims to enhance information sharing on foreign fighters and track terrorist suspects. Following the 2015 Paris attacks, political pressure increased for the adoption of an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system to enhance information sharing on foreign fighters and track terrorist suspects. EU officials argued for harmonization across member states on PNR collection and data-protection practices. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, expected to be finalized in early 2016, obliging airlines to provide PNR data for flights into and out of EU territory. The EU reached a provisional agreement in December 2015 on PNR data collection, usage, and data-protection practices. Airlines will be required to provide PNR data for flights in and out of EU territory, and member states can collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. Critics argue the system infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it doesn't go far enough in sharing PNR data. Critics argue that the envisioned PNR system in the EU will infringe on data privacy rights, while others believe it does not go far enough in sharing PNR data. The agreement calls for the exchange of PNR data between EU members but does not establish a centralized EU PNR database. EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement's provisions. EU officials urged national authorities to strengthen external border controls in response to the foreign fighter threat, including increasing electronic checks at the EU's external borders. Some member states resisted calls to amend the Schengen Borders Code for more extensive checks. In response to the surge of migrants and refugees into Europe and the attacks in Paris, the European Commission proposed a targeted modification of the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the Schengen area's borders. Some EU officials and member states resisted calls to amend the code further, fearing potential reimposition of internal border controls. The European Commission proposed modifications to the Schengen Borders Code in response to the refugee influx and Paris attacks, including mandatory checks of EU citizens at external borders and the establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard. Efforts to establish an EU border guard corps have faced challenges due to concerns about national sovereignty. The EU is also working to detect and remove online content promoting terrorism or extremism. The EU has established measures to strengthen border security and prevent radicalization, including the creation of an Internet Referral Unit to monitor and remove terrorist content online. Additionally, an Internet Forum has been launched to collaborate with technology companies in countering terrorist propaganda. Member states are urged to address societal factors contributing to extremism. The EU is working on revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has faced challenges due to varying national policies on crime and punishment. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training across the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has been challenging due to differing national policies on crime and punishment. EU officials argue that updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 and to avoid gaps in prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses. The EU is updating its common terrorism definition to address gaps in prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses, in compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The European Commission proposed revisions in December 2015, which will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. This initiative is part of the EU's efforts to enhance law enforcement and intelligence cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism since September 11, 2001. The EU has prioritized improving law enforcement and intelligence cooperation with the United States to combat terrorism since September 11, 2001. This partnership has led to a new dynamic in U.S.-EU relations, fostering dialogue on security issues. The Obama Administration has supported cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The Obama Administration has supported U.S. cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, aimed at countering violent extremism and strengthening criminal justice. The EU is a key partner in global counterterrorism efforts, focusing on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon and enhancing international cooperation against terrorism. US policymakers are concerned about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the US and most EU countries. The EU is a key partner in global counterterrorism efforts, focusing on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. US policymakers are concerned about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the US and most EU countries. U.S. and European officials are working closely on shared strategies to confront the influx of violent extremists in Syria and Iraq. In September 2014, the U.S. and EU officials collaborated on measures to address the foreign fighter threat, focusing on counter-radicalization, border security, and information sharing. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat foreign fighters globally and are providing support to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. After the Paris attacks in January 2015, the U.S. Attorney General participated in a meeting with European and North American interior ministers. In 2014, EU member states are supporting the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. Following the Paris attacks in January 2015, U.S. and European officials discussed terrorist threats and foreign fighters. U.S. officials are urging European governments and the EU to enhance information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases. They also support the establishment of an EU PNR system. U.S. officials are encouraging European governments and the EU to enhance information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases, such as the SIS and Europol. President Obama called on the EU to implement an agreement requiring airlines to share passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in tracking terrorist financing and sharing airline passenger data. The foreign fighter phenomenon highlights the importance of close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering undetected. Challenges in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship include data privacy concerns, differences in terrorist designation lists, and balancing measures to improve cooperation. The unauthorized disclosures of U.S. National Security Agency surveillance activities since June 2013 have renewed attention on U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements. Other issues include detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and balancing border controls with transatlantic travel and commerce. Legislation passed in December 2015 to strengthen the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on law enforcement matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. The U.S.-EU Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was established in response to concerns about Europeans joining or being influenced by the Islamic State. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on law enforcement matters have significantly increased since 2001, strengthening ties between the two entities. Key U.S. departments like State, Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury are actively involved in this cooperation, with high-level meetings occurring regularly to discuss police, judicial, and border control policies. The United States and the EU have established regular dialogues on terrorist financing, border and transport security, critical infrastructure protection, and preventing violent extremism. They also have reciprocal liaison relationships, with Europol having liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the United States stationing officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague for counterterrorism efforts. Europol and U.S. agencies have established reciprocal liaison relationships. Europol has two liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the U.S. has stationed 14 officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague to work on counterterrorism and international crimes. This collaboration has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes. The U.S. liaison at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague supports around 500 cases yearly, leading to operational successes against transnational crimes. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to enhance police and judicial cooperation, including sharing strategic and personal information between U.S. law enforcement and Europol. In 2001 and 2002, U.S. and Europol agreements were made to share strategic and personal information for police and judicial cooperation. Negotiations were challenging due to EU data protection standards. In 2007, a common security agreement was signed between the United States and the EU. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force, aiming to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing and prosecutorial cooperation. The U.S. and EU signed treaties in 2003 to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. Washington agreed to EU demands that extradited suspects will not face the death penalty, and also modernized extradition agreements. The extradition treaty between the U.S. and EU addresses challenges such as the death penalty and extradition of EU nationals. It modernizes existing agreements, streamlines information exchange, sets extradition priority rules, grants access to European financial information, speeds up request processing, allows evidence acquisition via video conferencing, and enables U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. The MLA treaty between the United States and EU member states provides access to European bank account and financial information in criminal investigations, speeds up request processing, allows evidence acquisition by video conferencing, and permits U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies due to existing bilateral relations between agencies and national police in EU member states. Europol's lack of enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information analysis are noted. European officials criticize the U.S. for expecting intelligence without reciprocation. Europol relies on national services for information analysis and lacks enforcement capabilities. European officials criticize the U.S. for not sharing intelligence reciprocally. Despite challenges, U.S. and European officials aim to enhance cooperation with Europol, signing agreements in 2015 to combat foreign fighters and illegal immigration. The United States and the EU cooperate in tracking and stopping terrorist financing, with agreements signed in 2015 to improve collaboration against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. They also work together in global forums like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force to suppress terrorist financing and enhance international financial investigative tools. Additionally, U.S. authorities have access to financial data through SWIFT, a Belgian-based consortium of international banks. The United States and the EU collaborate to combat terrorist financing through agreements signed in 2015. They work with global organizations like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force. U.S. authorities access financial data through SWIFT, aiding in the prevention of terrorist attacks in Europe. However, the sharing of SWIFT data remains controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. The US and EU collaborate to combat terrorist financing through agreements signed in 2015. They work with global organizations like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force. The sharing of SWIFT data remains controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. EU officials assert that leads from the data have helped prevent or investigate terrorist attacks in Europe. US and EU officials have worked together since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups, presenting a united front and curbing terrorist financing. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The lists are important for presenting a united front with the US and curbing terrorist financing. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities and has been a subject of debate between the US and EU. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities, with law enforcement measures differing based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. \"External\" entities have their assets frozen and financial resources restricted by all EU member states. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities, with law enforcement measures differing based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. All EU member states are legally obligated to freeze assets and restrict financial resources for \"external\" entities. For \"internal\" entities, inclusion on the list subjects them to strengthened police cooperation measures, with national governments applying their own sanctions to stem financing. Unanimous agreement among all EU member states is required to add or remove a person or entity from the list. The EU's common terrorist list includes over 80 individuals or entities, with law enforcement measures differing based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. National governments seek to apply their own sanctions to stem financing for listed individuals and entities. Unanimous agreement among all EU member states is required to add or remove a person or entity from the list. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add several organizations to the list, such as PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The EU's common terrorist list includes various groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and others. The US has also added members of ETA to its terrorist designation lists. However, there are disagreements between the US and EU on fully harmonizing their lists. The EU is hesitant to add certain Hamas-related charities due to differing views among member states. Some charities designated as Hamas fronts by the US, like Interpal, have been cleared by European authorities. Several EU member states have differing views on Hamas-related charities, with some considering them separate entities engaged in political or social work. Charities designated as Hamas fronts by the US, like Interpal, have been investigated by European authorities but cleared of funding terrorist activities. There is division among EU member states on whether to include Hezbollah on the EU's common terrorist list, with the US considering it a foreign terrorist organization. Some EU countries support adding Hezbollah to the list, while others, like France, oppose it. The United States considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization and applies sanctions. Some EU countries support adding Hezbollah to the EU's terrorist list, while others, like France, oppose it due to concerns about managing relations with Lebanon and Hezbollah's social services in poor communities. In 2012-2013, there was a renewed debate within the EU on Hezbollah. In 2012-2013, events like the Burgas airport bombing and Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war prompted calls for the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. In July 2013, the EU decided to add Hezbollah's military wing to its common terrorist list, following events like the Burgas airport bombing and Hezbollah's support of the Syrian government. This decision was seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain EU influence in the region. The EU's decision to include Hezbollah's military wing on its terrorist list was viewed as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain influence in the region. This move was seen as symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would undermine Hezbollah's legitimacy as a political and social actor. The EU's decision to designate Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organization was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would undermine Hezbollah's legitimacy. Some experts hoped this would lead to increased intelligence investigations in Europe, making it less attractive for Hezbollah. Critics argued that allowing Hezbollah to fundraise in Europe was a loophole. The US had long urged the EU to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Critics argued that listing only Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organization was insufficient as it allowed Hezbollah to fundraise in Europe. The US had long urged the EU to include Hezbollah on its common terrorist list. Following Bulgaria's announcement implicating Hezbollah in the Burgas bombing, the Obama Administration called on Europe to take proactive action to disrupt Hezbollah's financing schemes and operational networks to prevent future attacks. Members of Congress also sent letters urging the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. In response to the Burgas bombing, US officials and Members of Congress urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The EU's decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group was welcomed, but data privacy remains a key issue in US-EU cooperation on counterterrorism efforts. The EU's decision to designate Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group is seen as a positive step, but data privacy concerns remain a key issue in US-EU cooperation on counterterrorism efforts. EU regulations prioritize privacy rights and restrict the transfer of personal data to countries without adequate legal protections. Some EU officials and civil liberty groups question the US's ability to safeguard European citizens' personal data in information-sharing agreements. The EU has concerns about the US's ability to protect European citizens' personal data in information-sharing agreements due to unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs and allegations of US collection activities in Europe. This has strained transatlantic trust and exacerbated worries about data protection safeguards. The EU is concerned about US surveillance programs and collection activities in Europe, straining transatlantic trust and data protection safeguards. Analysts worry about the future of US-EU information-sharing agreements, with the European Parliament expressing serious concerns and establishing a special working group in response. The European Parliament expressed concerns about US surveillance programs and established a special working group to investigate alleged collection activities. The Parliament's working group, chaired by Claude Moraes, adopted the critical \"Moraes report\" in March 2014, which made recommendations on U.S.-EU security and economic issues. The European Parliament's working group, led by Claude Moraes, adopted the critical \"Moraes report\" in March 2014, which raised concerns about US surveillance programs and recommended actions on U.S.-EU security and economic issues, including information-sharing arrangements and data privacy agreements. The \"Moraes report\" called for the timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement, urging the U.S. to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection reforms in response to reported NSA programs and U.S. spying activities. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection reforms in response to reported NSA programs and U.S. spying activities. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials and business leaders about potential impacts on U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation. U.S. officials reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight mechanisms. The new provisions may hinder U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and burden U.S. companies. U.S. officials reassure EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight. A U.S.-EU working group was established to address NSA surveillance operations, including the PRISM program, and assess their impact on EU citizens' privacy rights. The European Commission issued a report on these findings in November 2013. The European Commission issued a report in November 2013 on NSA surveillance operations, including the PRISM program, and their impact on EU citizens' privacy rights. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for certain law enforcement data privacy violations. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to work with Congress to enact legislation allowing EU citizens to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was signed into law in February 2016. Controversy over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program emerged in 2006. Controversy arose in 2006 over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, with concerns about access to SWIFT financial data. In 2007, a deal was reached between the U.S. and EU to allow continued access for counterterrorism purposes, but some remained worried about data protection standards. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture required a new U.S.-EU agreement for data sharing. The European Parliament gained the right to approve international agreements like SWIFT, leading to the rejection of the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in 2010. In November 2009, the European Parliament rejected the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. This led to negotiations for a revised agreement in May 2010. In May 2010, negotiations began for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement to address concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Key European Parliament concerns included guaranteeing judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. in case of data abuse and reducing the use of \"bulk data\" transfers. Some MEPs called for more targeted transfers and greater supervision by an EU-appointed authority over U.S. access to SWIFT. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded between U.S. and EU officials. The draft included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the United States and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Despite some MEPs' dissatisfaction with certain provisions, two additional changes were made to the draft to avoid a \"no\" vote by the Parliament. The new draft SWIFT agreement between the U.S. and EU included provisions for legal redress for EU citizens in the United States and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. To address MEPs' concerns, two additional changes were made to the draft. One change involved appointing an independent observer in Washington, DC, to oversee the extraction of SWIFT data. The second change required the European Commission to present plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. This \"European TFTP\" would allow the EU to extract SWIFT data on European soil and send targeted results to U.S. authorities, avoiding bulk data transfers to the United States in the long term. The European Parliament approved the final iteration. The European Parliament approved the final iteration of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, by 484 votes to 109, with the agreement entering into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period. The agreement included provisions for automatic extensions unless notified otherwise, but some MEPs remained concerned about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the proper implementation of the SWIFT accord. The U.S.-EU SWIFT accord was approved by the European Parliament in July 2010 and entered into force in August 2010 for a five-year period. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the agreement. Reviews in 2011 and 2012 recommended measures for transparency and concluded that the TFTP had benefits in fighting terrorism. In December 2012, the Commission released the results of a second review of the TFTP agreement, confirming its concrete benefits in fighting terrorism. Concerns were raised in the European Parliament about U.S. surveillance activities in Europe, especially after reports of NSA monitoring in EU countries. The European Parliament expressed concerns about US handling of EU citizens' data following reports of NSA surveillance in EU countries. Resolutions called for the suspension of the US-EU SWIFT accord, but actual action would require the European Commission and member states to act, which they are hesitant to do. Reviews of the TFTP program showed that SWIFT data has been beneficial for European intelligence services. In late 2013 and mid-2014, reviews of the TFTP program showed that SWIFT data has been valuable for European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats, including those during the 2012 London Olympics and posed by EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. In May 2004, the US and EU agreed to share passenger name record data for flights to or from the US, in compliance with the US Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001. The US and EU reached an agreement allowing airlines to provide passenger name record data to US authorities within 15 minutes of a flight's departure. The agreement was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns, leading to the European Parliament challenging it in court. The Court annulled the agreement in 2006, citing improper legal basis. However, in 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the US and EU. In 2006, the EU Court of Justice annulled the PNR agreement due to improper legal basis. In 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the US and EU, allowing the US to store PNR data for up to 15 years and access sensitive passenger information in exceptional circumstances. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement allowed the United States to store PNR data for up to 15 years, access sensitive passenger information, and required airlines to send data 72 hours before a flight. The agreement reduced the number of data fields collected from 34 to 19, but faced objections from many MEPs. The European Parliament had to approve the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement for it to remain in force. Many MEPs objected to key elements such as the amount of data transferred, data retention period, and lack of redress for data misuse. Concerns were raised about potential data mining by U.S. authorities. Despite recognizing the legal uncertainties of rejecting the agreement, the Parliament postponed its vote in May 2010, calling for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement, calling for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission. In September 2010, the Commission issued the strategy, proposing the renegotiation of PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. Key principles included using PNR data for combating terrorism, providing clear information to passengers, and ensuring their right to redress. The European Commission proposed key principles for the use of PNR data, including combating terrorism, providing clear information to passengers, ensuring their right to redress, limiting data exchange categories, and retaining data for the shortest necessary time. In November 2010, the European Parliament endorsed the Commission's PNR strategy and supported new negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the necessity and proportionality of data exchange. In November 2010, the European Parliament supported new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the necessity and proportionality of data exchange. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord, recognizing the EP's concerns. U.S.-EU negotiations on a revised PNR accord began in December 2010. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights. In December 2010, U.S.-EU negotiations on a revised PNR accord were launched, with U.S. officials asserting the need to protect data and privacy rights. The U.S. emphasized that any new PNR agreement with the EU should not compromise the current program's operational effectiveness or invalidate existing bilateral deals with EU member states. Resolutions supporting these negotiations were introduced in the House and passed in the Senate in mid-May 2011. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House and passed in the Senate supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord. The United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement in late May 2011, introducing new provisions to enhance passenger information protection. The United States and the European Commission finalized a revised PNR agreement in May 2011, introducing new measures to protect passengers' personal information. The agreement included provisions for depersonalizing passenger records after six months, reducing data storage time, and limiting access to authorized personnel. It also clarified passenger rights to redress and ensured that boarding decisions would not be based solely on automated data processing. Additionally, it acknowledged the possibility of the EU developing its own PNR system in the future. The revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011 provided legal certainty on passenger rights, clarified redress procedures, and addressed concerns about automated data processing. Despite revisions, some MEPs were still unsatisfied with the retention of passenger data for up to 15 years and increased data transmission requirements. Some MEPs remained unsatisfied with the May 2011 version of the U.S.-EU PNR agreement, as it allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years, increased data transmission requirements, and broadened the use of PNR data for criminal offenses. U.S. officials argued that the new draft was stronger than the 2007 version. The Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence held a hearing on intelligence-sharing and terrorist travel, focusing on the U.S.-EU PNR agreement negotiations. U.S. officials stated that the May 2011 draft was stronger than the 2007 version, addressing EU concerns on data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded with \"real improvements\" according to the European Commission. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, containing \"real improvements\" over the previous version. The agreement included changes to limit the use of PNR data to terrorist or serious transnational crimes and varied retention times based on the type of crime. EU member states approved the agreement in December 2011, with Germany and Austria abstaining due to concerns over data retention and redress. In December 2011, EU member states approved a new U.S.-EU PNR agreement with varying retention times based on the type of crime. Germany and Austria abstained due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs criticized the changes as cosmetic, while others supported the agreement for stronger data protection guarantees. Despite some misgivings, many MEPs planned to vote for the 2011 accord to provide airlines with legal certainty. The new U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with 409 votes in favor, 226 against, and 33 abstentions. U.S. officials welcomed the endorsement, emphasizing the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy rights. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with 409 votes in favor. It was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and entered into force on August 8, 2012. The agreement will be valid for seven years and can be renewed for another seven years. In November 2013, the European Commission published the results of a joint review of the PNR program, stating that it is an efficient tool to fight terrorism and serious international crimes. In November 2013, the European Commission published the results of a U.S.-EU joint review of the PNR program, affirming its effectiveness in combating terrorism and international crimes. However, concerns have been raised about U.S. data protection safeguards, leading to calls for reassessment of the agreement. MEPs have questioned the PNR program, with concerns about data protection in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders see information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in fighting terrorism. Washington aims for an umbrella agreement with the EU to ease negotiations on data-sharing accords. The EU and US aim to establish an umbrella agreement for sharing personal data to facilitate future data-sharing accords in law enforcement. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a framework agreement to protect data exchanged in counterterrorism efforts. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate in 2010 for negotiating such an accord to ensure high standards of data protection on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU and US are working on an umbrella agreement for sharing personal data in law enforcement. The agreement aims to bridge privacy differences and ensure high data protection standards. Specific agreements for data transfer, like SWIFT or PNR, will still be needed. Negotiations for the \"umbrella\" Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) officially began in March 2011. In December 2010, EU member states approved the Commission's mandate. In March 2011, the US and EU started negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) for law enforcement data exchange. The agreement aimed for mutual recognition of data protection systems, hoping for EU \"adequacy\" for US standards. This agreement built on common data protection principles adopted in 2009. The US and EU negotiated a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to ensure mutual recognition of data protection systems. Progress was made on provisions related to data security, transparency, and oversight, but controversial issues like purpose limitation and redress remained. EU officials pushed for judicial redress rights for European citizens in the US. Some controversial issues remained in the negotiations for the Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA), including purpose limitation, retention times, and redress. EU officials insisted on judicial redress rights for European citizens in the US, while US Administrations argued that other means of redress were available. The discussions were largely stalled until revelations of US surveillance activities injected renewed momentum into the negotiations. The DPPA negotiations were stalled due to issues like purpose limitation and redress, with EU officials pushing for judicial redress rights for European citizens in the US. However, revelations of US surveillance activities in 2013 injected new momentum into the discussions. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume without delay, emphasizing the need for transatlantic trust restoration through the DPPA. Attorney General Holder announced support for bringing the negotiations forward in June 2014. The \"Moraes report\" in March 2014 emphasized the importance of concluding the DPPA for transatlantic trust. In June 2014, Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to legislation ensuring EU citizens' right to judicial redress for privacy violations. This decision aimed to facilitate final agreement on the DPPA. The Obama Administration made efforts to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments by finalizing the DPPA. U.S. and EU negotiators completed the text of the DPPA on September 8, 2015, but the EU required U.S. judicial redress legislation before signing. In response, H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 were introduced to meet EU demands for judicial redress. The DPPA would not be signed until U.S. judicial redress legislation was adopted. H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 were introduced to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations. Congressional action on the Judicial Redress Act gained importance after October 6, 2015. The Judicial Redress Act gained significance after the EU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement in 2000 due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield\" agreement. The new \"Privacy Shield,\" agreed upon by U.S. and EU negotiators on February 2, 2016, aims to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor Agreement. The Judicial Redress Act, passed by the House in October 2015, is seen as a step towards meeting EU data transfer standards, but concerns remain about U.S. government access to personal data in the commercial sector. The Judicial Redress Act, passed by the House on October 20, 2015, and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, included provisions related to data transfer policies and national security interests. The amended version was signed into law on February 24, 2016. This Act is seen as necessary for the formal signature of the U.S.-EU agreement on Privacy Shield. The U.S.-EU provisional agreement on Privacy Shield was further supported by the enactment of H.R. 1428, signed into law on February 24, 2016. The Judicial Redress Act, seen as crucial for the U.S.-EU DPPA signature, was warmly welcomed by the EU. Approval of the DPPA by EU member states and the European Parliament is required for it to take effect, a process that may take several months. The U.S. and EU have emphasized cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security. They have signed agreements on information exchange for lost passports and biometric identifiers. The DPPA must be approved by EU member states and the European Parliament to take effect, a process that could take several months. The United States and the EU have collaborated on enhancing international information exchanges on lost and stolen passports, promoting the use of biometric identifiers for travel document security, strengthening aviation security measures globally, and improving cargo and supply chain security. They reaffirmed their commitment to bolstering supply chain security and fostering greater global cooperation on this issue in a joint statement in June 2011. States and the EU have collaborated to improve cargo security and global supply chain security. In a joint statement in June 2011, they reaffirmed their commitment to bolster supply chain security and foster greater global cooperation. Both parties are working to find a balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Measures have been implemented since the 2001 terrorist attacks to enhance aviation security, with recent incidents bringing aviation and air cargo security to the forefront of U.S.-EU discussions. The EU has implemented measures to improve aviation security, with recent incidents highlighting the ongoing terrorist threat. This includes the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot. In July 2014, tighter rules were introduced for carrying electronic devices on U.S.-bound flights due to fears of Al Qaeda-linked groups using them to disguise explosives. The decision by U.S. authorities in early July 2014 to tighten rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights due to fears of Al Qaeda-linked groups using them to disguise explosives highlights the ongoing terrorist threat to aviation. U.S. and EU have worked together to bridge gaps in their policies regarding aviation security, with agreements reached in the past to address concerns such as armed air marshals on flights. In 2003, some EU countries objected to new U.S. rules requiring armed air marshals on certain transatlantic flights. In 2008, the U.S. and EU agreed on coordinating air cargo security measures, including 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights. In June 2012, they reached an agreement on air security. The United States and the EU reached an agreement in June 2012 to mutually recognize each other's air cargo security regimes, eliminating duplication of security controls and improving efficiency for cargo operators. This partnership aims to enhance cargo security, save time and money, and facilitate transatlantic shipments. The U.S. and EU have agreed to mutually recognize each other's air cargo security regimes, aiming to enhance cargo security, save time and money for operators, and facilitate transatlantic shipments. This agreement will also allow European operators to meet the U.S. requirement for 100% screening of cargo on passenger planes bound for the United States. Despite some differences in perspective, both sides are committed to promoting cooperation in aviation and air cargo security. The U.S. and EU have agreed to mutually recognize each other's air cargo security regimes to enhance cargo security and facilitate transatlantic shipments. Despite some differences, both sides are committed to promoting cooperation in aviation and air cargo security. In response to the 2009 attack, the U.S. accelerated the installation of body scanners at airports and encouraged the EU to do the same. Some EU countries were hesitant due to privacy and health concerns, but the European Parliament eventually backed the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards in place. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards to protect privacy and health. The scanners were required to only produce stick figure images, not body images, and x-ray scans were banned. Passengers had the right to opt for a manual search, and the use of scanners was voluntary. The European Commission adopted these conditions in November 2011, but member states are not obligated to deploy the scanners. The European Parliament approved the voluntary use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards for privacy and health. The European Commission adopted these conditions in November 2011, but member states are not required to deploy the scanners. Some European officials have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports, but in January 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners producing revealing images by June 2013. In January 2013, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced the removal of full-body scanners producing revealing images by June 2013. Concerns about privacy violations were addressed as scanners at U.S. airports will now only use millimeter wave technology. Worries about changes to EU regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage were also noted. The EU planned to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, following the introduction of liquid screening equipment in all EU airports. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of current liquid-screening technology. The EU postponed its 2013 deadline to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage due to concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. In January 2014, the EU lifted prohibitions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels in carry-on baggage as a first phase. The EU postponed its 2013 deadline for liquid screening equipment and restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. In January 2014, they lifted prohibitions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, extending the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU. The U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) stations customs officers in foreign ports to pre-screen U.S.-bound cargo containers for dangerous substances. Ten EU member states participate in CSI. In May 2012, the U.S. and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security. This mutual recognition accord aims to simplify customs procedures for trusted traders designated by C-TPAT or AEO programs. The U.S. and EU have agreed to recognize each other's trusted trader programs, aiming to lower costs and simplify procedures for trusted traders. This agreement allows customs authorities to focus on risky consignments and facilitate legitimate transatlantic trade. EU officials opposed a provision for 100% container scanning, citing trade disruption and financial burdens on EU ports and businesses. The U.S. and EU have agreed to recognize each other's trusted trader programs to facilitate legitimate transatlantic trade. EU officials opposed 100% container scanning, citing trade disruption and financial burdens on EU ports and businesses. U.S. policymakers shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% scanning, leading to extensions of the deadline. In May 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced in June 2014. Proponents argue that current manifest data is insufficient for determining risk. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program allows visa-free travel for citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe, generating tensions with the EU over equal application to all member states. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows short-term visa-free travel to the US for citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe. New EU members were excluded from the VWP due to statutory requirements, leading to tensions over visa reciprocity between the US and EU. Some in Congress supported extending the VWP to new EU members, while others had security concerns post-9/11. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53), which included changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to strengthen security measures and allow more EU members to qualify. This was in response to concerns about terrorists with European citizenship exploiting the VWP, such as French citizen Zacarias Moussaoui and British-born Richard Reid. The new requirements included meeting security and passport standards, as well as signing information-sharing agreements. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) strengthened the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by enhancing security measures and expanding eligibility for more EU members. This included meeting security and passport standards, signing information-sharing agreements, and submitting biographical information through ESTA. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was also given the authority to waive specific admission requirements, allowing new EU member states to join the VWP. Currently, 23 out of the EU's 28 member states are part of the program, with efforts ongoing to include the remaining five (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was granted the authority to waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Currently, 23 out of the EU's 28 member states are part of the program, with ongoing efforts to include the remaining five (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania). The EU has implemented a reciprocity mechanism to push for full visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries exempt from EU visa requirements. Under new EU rules, visa-free travel for citizens of third countries may be suspended if there is no full visa reciprocity. The European Commission has not yet suspended any visa-free travel but is monitoring the situation every six months. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows Europeans to easily return home and enter the US without a visa, causing concern for US officials. The Obama Administration supports the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a concern for US officials due to Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq. The Obama Administration supports the VWP, but has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers. The November 2015 attacks in Paris highlighted the need for comprehensive screening of VWP visitors. In 2015, DHS implemented new traveler screening requirements for VWP countries to enhance security measures. Following the Paris attacks, the Obama Administration made additional changes to the VWP, including capturing information on past travel to terrorist safe havens. The Obama Administration strengthened security controls for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by capturing information on past travel to terrorist safe havens. Legislation passed in 2015 prohibits individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the US under the VWP. The Travel Prevention Act of 2015, part of the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act, enhances VWP security by restricting entry for those who have traveled to specific countries since March 1, 2011. VWP participant countries must meet certain passport and screening requirements. DHS expanded restrictions to include Libya, Somalia, and Yemen in February 2016. The Travel Prevention Act of 2015 enhances VWP security by restricting entry for those who have traveled to specific countries since March 1, 2011. DHS expanded restrictions to include Libya, Somalia, and Yemen in February 2016. EU officials are concerned about the new VWP requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. Many European policymakers question the effectiveness of the new VWP legislation, stating it may impact European citizens who have traveled to specified countries for legitimate reasons. U.S. officials mention exemptions for government and military personnel, with the DHS having the authority to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. EU leaders have warned about potential reciprocal measures regarding visa-free travel restrictions. The Secretary of DHS has the authority to waive exclusion from the VWP for individuals on a case-by-case basis, including journalists and humanitarian NGO workers. Concerns have been raised about potential discrimination based on ethnicity in the new VWP legislation. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals. EU leaders have warned about possible reciprocal measures regarding visa-free travel restrictions. On January 13, 2016, Representative Justin Amash introduced H.R. 4830, the \"Equal Protection in Travel Act 2016,\" to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals. A companion measure, S. 2449, was introduced by Senator Jeff Flake on January 20, 2016. The changes aim to reduce the EU's potential imposition of reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens traveling to Europe, emphasizing the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a source of tension between the U.S. and Europe, with past U.S. policies facing criticism in Europe. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a point of tension between the U.S. and Europe, with past U.S. policies facing criticism in Europe for sacrificing civil liberties and human rights standards. Issues such as the U.S.-run detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, plans to try enemy combatants before military commissions, and the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" have sparked widespread criticism in Europe. The practice of \"extraordinary rendition\" and the possible presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe have also drawn significant attention and prompted investigations by European institutions. The European media and institutions were concerned about the rendition of individuals and the presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe. Many European leaders criticized the U.S. detainee and interrogation policies for violating international and European law, as well as undermining efforts to counter terrorism by winning Muslim \"hearts and minds.\" The Bush Administration defended these policies as necessary. The European media and institutions criticized U.S. detainee and interrogation policies for violating international and European law, as well as undermining efforts to counter terrorism. The Bush Administration defended these policies as necessary tools in the fight against terrorism. U.S.-EU frictions over terrorist detainee policies have subsided to some degree since the start of the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration worked to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility and secure agreements with foreign governments to accept detainees. U.S.-EU tensions over detainee policies eased with Obama's executive orders banning torture and reviewing Bush Administration legal opinions. EU officials welcomed these actions and the appointment of a special envoy to persuade countries to accept cleared detainees. In March 2009, the U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility by persuading countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, while others declined, causing challenges for the Obama Administration. Congressional opposition and restrictions hindered the Administration's efforts to transfer detainees to other countries. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to reluctance from other countries, congressional opposition, and restrictions on transferring detainees. In March 2011, an executive order created indefinite detention for dangerous detainees not charged or convicted. Military commission trials for detainees also resumed after a two-year freeze. European policymakers are concerned that Guant\u00e1namo's existence aids in terrorist recruitment. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional opposition and restrictions on transferring detainees. European policymakers worry about the facility serving as a recruitment tool for terrorist groups and have concerns about detainees' well-being. In May 2013, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the closure of Guant\u00e1namo, while President Obama renewed his commitment to shuttering the facility. Congress passed a measure in December 2013 to address the issue. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional opposition and restrictions on transferring detainees. In December 2013, Congress passed a measure easing restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees to other countries, but maintained restrictions on bringing detainees to the United States for trial. President Obama urged Congress to lift remaining restrictions to ultimately close the detention facility. In November 2015, Congress maintained restrictions on transferring Guant\u00e1namo detainees to the US but required a plan for closing the facility. President Obama submitted a proposal in February 2016, urging Congress to help close the facility before his term ended in January 2017. As of February 2016, 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo, with 35 cleared for transfer. European concerns about the past role of European countries in detainee transfers also persist. During Obama's term, 147 detainees were resettled from Guant\u00e1namo, leaving 91 detainees in February 2016. European Parliament has investigated EU member states' involvement in CIA detention facilities and rendition practices. The European Parliament has repeatedly urged EU member states to investigate alleged CIA detention facilities and rendition flights. In 2015, a resolution was passed to resume investigations into the CIA's activities following a U.S. Senate report. The resolution also called for the U.S. to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to the CIA programs. The European Parliament has urged EU countries to investigate alleged CIA detention facilities and rendition flights. A 2015 resolution called for the U.S. to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to CIA programs, raising concerns about U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. The ongoing proceedings against CIA officers in some EU states from the Bush era could jeopardize U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. Efforts to enhance U.S.-EU collaboration since the 2001 attacks have been supported by successive U.S. Administrations and Members of Congress. Despite initial skepticism, the George W. Bush Administration prioritized engaging the EU on police and judicial matters to strengthen U.S. law enforcement partnerships in Europe and improve border controls and transport security. The political benefits of engaging the EU on police and judicial matters outweigh potential risks, given Europe's role as a key U.S. law enforcement partner. Improved U.S.-EU cooperation on border controls and transport security aims to track suspected terrorists and prevent their entry into the United States or Europe. However, U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation is complicated by different competencies and policy preferences. The United States sometimes prefers bilateral negotiations on issues like the Visa Waiver Program. The EU and the United States have differing preferences on negotiating certain counterterrorism issues, such as the Visa Waiver Program. Despite occasional tensions, both sides are committed to enhancing cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. The Obama Administration has largely continued the Bush Administration's policy of engaging with the EU in these areas. Cooperation between the U.S. and EU is seen as crucial in combating potential threats from European and American citizens involved with Islamist groups. U.S.-EU cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security is crucial in combating threats from European and American citizens involved with Islamist groups. Congress has focused on issues such as aviation security, border control measures, and visa policy, passing the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to strengthen security controls. In response to concerns about European citizens joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Congressional decisions on intelligence reforms and data privacy could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. EU officials view the U.S. Judicial Redress Act positively for data privacy and protection. The U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation may be affected by potential changes in U.S. surveillance laws. The passage of the U.S. Judicial Redress Act is seen positively by EU officials for data privacy and protection, aiming to rebuild trust in information-sharing arrangements. Members of Congress could influence the European Parliament's views on international agreements related to counterterrorism. Parliament's growing influence in counterterrorism areas and new role in approving international agreements, such as U.S.-EU SWIFT and PNR accords, may allow Members of Congress to shape Parliament's views. European Parliamentarians appreciate efforts by some Members of Congress to engage in dialogue on U.S. surveillance operations. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament on changes to U.S. surveillance legislation, urging pragmatic collaboration. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led separate congressional delegations in late 2013. The European Parliament is discussing possible changes to U.S. surveillance legislation and is urged to work with the United States to protect both nations. Some Members of Congress have ongoing contacts with European Parliament counterparts, and the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue brings them together twice a year to discuss foreign policy and economic issues. Some Members of Congress have ongoing contacts with their counterparts in the European Parliament through the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue, aiming to strengthen ties and cooperation between the two bodies. This exchange provides opportunities for enhancing transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
