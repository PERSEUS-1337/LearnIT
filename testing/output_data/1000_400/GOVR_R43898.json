    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring tax provisions and made some temporary provisions permanent, reducing tax policy uncertainty. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) permanently extended most tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, as well as indexed the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions that expired in 2013 through 2014. Several tax provisions that expired in 2011, 2012, and 2013 were temporarily extended through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired in 2014. These temporary tax provisions, often referred to as \"tax extenders,\" have been regularly extended by Congress. For example, the research tax credit was extended 16 times before being made permanent in 2016. In the 114th Congress, the debate on tax extenders focused on whether expired provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. In P.L. 114-113, all expired tax provisions were either temporarily extended or made permanent, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, not all expired provisions were made permanent, leaving some tax extenders set to expire in 2016. The tax extenders debate in the 114th Congress focused on making expired provisions permanent or temporarily extending them. While some provisions were made permanent, not all were, leaving some tax extenders set to expire in 2016. Further debate may address whether these provisions should be extended. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) contained the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which temporarily extended or made various tax provisions permanent. Other related CRS reports include recently expired business, individual, charitable, community assistance-related, and housing-related tax provisions. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions. This Act also made enhancements to child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit permanent, along with a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Additionally, it included changes to the high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax and a one-year moratorium on the annual fee on health insurance providers. The PATH Act in the Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 extended or made permanent various tax provisions, including enhancements to child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. It also included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, changes to the high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax, and a one-year moratorium on the annual fee on health insurance providers. Other legislation considered in the 113th Congress proposed extensions and permanent provisions for expiring tax provisions. In the 113th Congress, legislation was considered to extend expiring tax provisions for one year or make them permanent. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed to make certain provisions permanent, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances. In the 114th Congress, the House passed legislation to permanently extend certain expired provisions. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend various tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances, that had expired in 2014 for two years. The House had previously passed legislation to permanently extend certain expired provisions in the 114th Congress. The Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 for two years. The tax code contains numerous temporary provisions, often referred to as \"tax extenders,\" which are regularly extended by Congress for short periods. The term \"tax extender\" refers to expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress for short periods. These provisions are added over time for various reasons such as evaluating effectiveness, providing relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. In theory, temporary tax provisions allow Congress to evaluate effectiveness before extension. Reasons for temporary provisions include providing relief during economic weakness or disasters and for budgetary purposes. However, the rationale is undermined if provisions are regularly extended without review. Enacting temporary tax provisions allows for evaluation before extension, but if regularly extended without review, the rationale is undermined. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler highlighted in 2012 the importance of expiration dates to force policymakers to assess costs and benefits, but in practice, systematic review rarely occurs. Instead, expiring provisions are typically passed as a package without individual analysis. In theory, systematic review of expiring tax provisions is crucial, but in practice, they are often passed without individual analysis. While most provisions are extended, some, like tax incentives for ethanol, have not been renewed due to duplicative benefits. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the costs outweigh the benefits. The Government Accountability Office found that tax credits for ethanol under the renewable fuel standard were duplicative and did not increase consumption. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the cost. Tax policy can be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief, such as bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Other temporary provisions have been enacted for special economic circumstances like the payroll tax cut. Relief policies like enhanced casualty loss deductions and net operating loss carrybacks, as well as temporary provisions such as mortgage forgiveness exclusion and payroll tax cuts, have been enacted to address economic crises. It is debated whether temporary provisions should expire once the situation is resolved, and temporary tax policies may be enacted for budgetary reasons. Short-term extensions are easier to offset than long-term or permanent extensions due to budget constraints. Temporary tax provisions are easier to offset for budgetary reasons and have a smaller effect on the long-term fiscal outlook. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, so extending them regularly would overstate projected revenues. Temporary tax benefits are a form of federal subsidy that treats eligible activities favorably. If temporary tax provisions are routinely extended, the CBO baseline may overstate revenues, affecting the long-term fiscal outlook. These provisions act as federal subsidies, influencing economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating extenders involves considering their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity. Policymakers must prioritize economic objectives when deciding on extenders. Tax extenders are evaluated based on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. They may provide subsidies to encourage certain activities, but their impact on economic welfare depends on whether they address market failures. Extenders can improve economic efficiency by remedying distortions, but policymakers must prioritize economic objectives when deciding on them. Tax extenders can improve economic efficiency by addressing market failures and tax distortions. They may stimulate desired activities better than direct subsidies, but direct spending programs can be more effective at targeting resources. Fairness in taxes is achieved when they contribute to a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden, but tax extenders can result in varying tax amounts for individuals with similar incomes and expenses. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens for individuals with similar incomes, deviating from the principles of horizontal equity. They also benefit those with higher incomes more than those with lower incomes, leading to vertical equity concerns in taxation. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens for individuals with similar incomes, deviating from the principles of horizontal equity. Most extenders are considered inequitable as they benefit those with higher incomes more, reducing the progressivity of the tax system and impacting vertical equity. An example shows how tax benefits can vary based on income levels, affecting the fairness of tax distribution. The tax benefit of extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens for individuals with similar incomes, impacting vertical equity. For example, two teachers with $250 in classroom expenses may receive different deductions based on their tax brackets. This complexity in the tax code raises administration costs and favors higher-income taxpayers over lower-income ones. The tax code complexity from extenders raises administration costs and favors higher-income taxpayers. Dozens of temporary tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, classified into individual, business, charitable, or energy categories. Most provisions extended in P.L. 114-113 were part of previous tax extender legislation, categorized into individual, business, charitable, or energy. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses for school teachers was made permanent in this legislation. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses for school teachers, state and local sales taxes deduction, tuition and related expenses deduction, mortgage insurance premiums deduction, and parity for employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits were extended multiple times and made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Business provisions that expired in 2014 had also been extended multiple times. The deduction for state and local sales taxes and the provision for employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Business provisions that expired in 2014, such as the research tax credit and New Markets Tax Credit, also expired at the end of 2014. Bonus depreciation and enhanced expensing allowances, viewed as economic stimulus measures, also expired in 2014. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and other business-related extender provisions expired at the end of 2014. Some provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, while others were extended through 2019 or 2016. Four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were also made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019, with a phase-down starting in 2017. Other business tax extenders were made permanent or extended through 2019 or 2016. Several charitable provisions were also made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019, with a phase-down starting in 2017. Other energy-related tax provisions were also extended through 2016, including incentives for energy efficient homes and alternative technology vehicles. The tax incentives for energy efficient homes and alternative technology vehicles, including fuel cell vehicles, hybrids, and plug-in electric vehicles, were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. However, the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired at the end of 2013 and was not extended. The tax incentives for alternative motor vehicles, including hybrids and advanced lean-burn technology vehicles, were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired at the end of 2013 but was not extended. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. Congress regularly extends expired tax provisions, with P.L. 114-113 also making certain provisions permanent. The total cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with a significant portion attributable to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. Nearly one-third of this cost is due to extensions of provisions scheduled to expire in 2017 and the two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The total cost of extending these provisions is estimated at $426.8 billion, with 89% of the total cost associated with permanent extensions. The estimated cost of permanently extending provisions that expired in 2014 is $361.4 billion. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 are estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. $559.5 billion, or 89% of the total cost, is associated with permanent extensions. The estimated cost of permanent extension of provisions listed in Table 1 is $361.4 billion. Only $17.7 billion (less than 3%) was for the two-year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016. Legislation in the House and Senate considered making certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015, the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946), that would retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The cost of extending these provisions, as proposed in S. 1946, was estimated to be $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window, excluding macroeconomic effects. The cost of extending expired tax provisions in S. 1946 was $86.6 billion over 10 years, excluding macroeconomic effects. Including macroeconomic effects, the cost was $96.9 billion. Extending certain expired provisions is expected to boost economic growth in the short term, but may increase federal debt and lead to higher interest rates, potentially slowing economic growth. The cost estimate for S. 1946 is lower than the estimate without macroeconomic effects. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016 to 2025 budget window. According to CBO's estimates, extending expiring tax provisions from 2016 to 2025 would cost $897.9 billion. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to various tax credits. Most of the provisions set to expire by 2025 were already extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Extending expiring tax provisions from 2016 to 2025 would cost $897.9 billion, with most provisions already extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels likely to occur due to assumed expiration of tax extender provisions. Short-term extensions cost less than extending provisions through the budget window. The cost of providing short-term extensions for expiring tax provisions is lower than extending them through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions, while JCT scores reflect the impact relative to current law. Temporary extensions may result in lower 10-year revenue costs compared to 2015, especially for tax deferrals like bonus depreciation. The cost of temporary extensions for expiring tax provisions is lower than extending them through the budget window. Bonus depreciation is an example of a timing provision with short-term costs exceeding long-term costs. The one-year extension in 2014 cost $1.2 billion over 10 years, while the one-year revenue loss in 2015 was $45.3 billion. The extension through 2019 cost $11.3 billion over 10 years, with a 2016 cost estimated at $90.6 billion. The cost of bonus depreciation extensions through the budget window varies, with short-term costs exceeding long-term costs. The one-year revenue loss in 2015 was $45.3 billion, while the extension through 2019 cost $11.3 billion over 10 years. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Legislation in the 114th and 113th Congresses considered making certain expired tax provisions permanent or temporarily extending them. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions. During the 114th Congress, legislation was considered to make certain expired tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years. The House also passed a bill to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to make certain expired tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179. Other bills like the America Gives More Act of 2015 and the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 also focused on extending and modifying tax credits and deductions. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 aimed to modify and make permanent the research tax credit, along with other legislation to deduct state and local sales taxes. These measures would have cost $317.5 billion over a 10-year budget window. Additionally, the Committee on Ways and Means had reported other legislation during the 114th Congress to make permanent expired tax provisions. During the 113th and 114th Congress, proposals were made to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was passed to extend provisions for one year, while the EXPIRE Act proposed a two-year extension through 2015. The House also passed legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent. The EXPIRE Act (S. 2260) proposed extending expiring provisions for two years through 2015. The House passed legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent during the 113th Congress, reducing revenues by an estimated $511.4 billion over 10 years. Several charitable-related provisions were passed in the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719) during the 113th Congress. Some international-related extender provisions were not made permanent, and certain provisions expired at the end of 2013 but were not extended in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295). The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not included in the EXPIRE Act but have since been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not extended in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295) but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 and was modified and retroactively extended through December 31, 2019, in 2015. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were extended through December 31, 2019, in subsequent legislation. Incentives for various alternative technology vehicles have expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. Incentives for most alternative technology vehicles have expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. Two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles received an extension through 2016. Several energy-related and disaster-related provisions expired and were not extended."
