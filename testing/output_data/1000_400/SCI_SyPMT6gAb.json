This is important because on-policy evaluation is costly and has negative effects. A major challenge in off-policy learning is developing counterfactual estimators with low variance and generalization error. In this work, a new counterfactual learning principle for off-policy learning with bandit feedbacks is introduced. The method minimizes distribution divergence between logging and new policies, eliminating the need for sample variance regularization. End-to-end training algorithms using variational divergence minimization with neural network policies show significant improvement over baseline algorithms. Off-policy learning is crucial for evaluating deterministic policies using historical data, as on-policy evaluation is costly and has negative impacts. Off-policy learning involves evaluating and improving a deterministic policy using historical data, which is important due to the high cost and risks associated with on-policy evaluation in real-world scenarios. Utilizing historic data for off-policy evaluation and learning allows for safe exploration of policy hypotheses before deployment. Various methods, such as Q learning, have been studied in the context of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits. Utilizing historic data for off-policy evaluation and learning is crucial to avoid high costs and risks for advertisers. Various methods like Q learning and doubly robust estimator have been studied in the context of reinforcement learning and contextual bandits. A new direction in off-policy learning involves using logged interaction data with limited feedback, such as scalar rewards, without revealing information about other possibilities. In the context of off-policy learning in bandit feedback, the challenge lies in handling the distribution mismatch between the logging policy and a new policy. BID34 addressed this by deriving a new counterfactual risk to tackle the generalization error induced by this mismatch. BID34 introduced a new counterfactual risk minimization framework to address the distribution mismatch between logging policy and a new policy in off-policy learning. The framework includes a sample variance regularization term in the empirical risk minimization objective. However, the linear stochastic model parametrization limits representation power, and efficient training algorithms remain a challenge. The paper introduces a new learning principle for off-policy learning with bandit feedback, connecting it to the generalization error bound of importance sampling. It proposes a method to regularize the generalization error of the new policy by minimizing distribution divergence with the logging policy. The policy is parametrized as a neural network for end-to-end training, solving the divergence minimization problem using variational divergence techniques.

The policy is parametrized as a neural network for end-to-end training, utilizing variational divergence techniques for divergence minimization. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates improved performance over conventional baselines. The curr_chunk discusses off-policy learning with logged bandit feedback, where a policy maps inputs to outputs using stochastic policies parametrized by \u03b8. Actions are taken by sampling from the distribution h(Y|x), with each action having a probability of h(y|x) being selected. The curr_chunk explains the concept of off-policy learning with logged bandit feedback, where a policy is defined by a distribution h(Y|x) parametrized by \u03b8. Actions are taken by sampling from this distribution, and the goal is to minimize the expected risk on test data. In off-policy learning with logged bandit feedback, the goal is to find a policy with minimum expected risk on test data using data collected from a logging policy. Challenges arise when the logging policy's distribution is skewed, limiting feedback for certain actions.

Challenges arise when the logging policy's distribution is skewed, limiting feedback for certain actions. To address this, propensity scoring with importance sampling is used to account for distribution mismatch and estimate the expected risk. The vanilla approach to solving the problem of generalization error involves propensity scoring with importance sampling to address distribution mismatch. Counterfactual risk minimization introduces a regularization term for sample variance to mitigate flaws in the vanilla approach. The authors proposed a regularization term for sample variance to address the large variance in the dataset. They approximated the regularization term via first-order Taylor expansion to enable stochastic optimization. This approach neglects non-linear terms and introduces approximation errors. Instead of empirically estimating variance from samples, they utilized a parametrized policy to derive variance.

The importance sampling weight w(z) = p(z) p0(z) is defined for random variable z with probability density functions p and p0. An identity lemma and theorem provide bounds for loss functions and divergence in the context of sampling distributions. Theorem 1 provides an upper bound for the second moment of the weighted loss function. It involves random variables X and Y with a defined loss function \u03b4(x, y). The bound is related to joint distribution over x and y. Theorem 2 establishes a generalization bound between expected risk and empirical risk using distribution divergence function, with a probability guarantee. Theorem 2 establishes a bound between expected risk and empirical risk using distribution divergence function, with a probability guarantee. The proof involves Bernstein inequality and second moment bound, highlighting bias-variance trade-offs in empirical risk minimization problems. This motivates minimizing variance regularized objectives in bandit learning settings. In bandit learning settings, instead of directly optimizing the reweighed loss and suffering from high variance in test settings, minimizing variance regularized objectives is proposed. The model hyper-parameter \u03bb controls the trade-off between empirical risk and model variance. Distributionally robust learning is explored as an alternative formulation to regularized ERM. In light of recent success in distributionally robust learning, an alternative formulation of regularized ERM is explored. The new constrained optimization formulation, with a pre-determined constant \u03c1 as the regularization hyper-parameter, provides a good surrogate for the true risk. This new objective function eliminates the need to compute sample variance in existing bounds, especially when dealing with parametrized distributions and finite samples.

Recent advancements in f-gan networks and Gumbel soft-max sampling can aid in estimating the divergence function. Additionally, the stochasticity of the logging policy is emphasized for effective learning. The stochasticity of the logging policy is crucial for effective learning. A deterministic logging policy with peaked masses and zeros in its domain makes learning difficult as unexplored regions hinder counterfactual learning.

The method draws a connection between divergence and the f-divergence measure, providing a lower bound for the minimization objective. The universal approximation theorem of neural networks states that neural networks can approximate continuous functions on a compact set with any desired precision. The final objective is a saddle point of a function that maps input pairs to a scalar value, with the policy acting as a sampling distribution. The final objective is a saddle point of a function that maps input pairs to a scalar value, with the policy acting as a sampling distribution. The saddle point trained with mini-batch estimation is a consistent estimator of the true divergence, denoted as Df. The estimation error is decomposed into terms related to the parametric family of neural networks and the approximation error of empirical mean estimation. The estimation error is decomposed into terms related to the parametric family of neural networks and the approximation error of empirical mean estimation. The first term involves the difference between an empirical distribution and the underlying population distribution, verified by the strong law of large numbers. The second term is rewritten using the universal approximation theorem, showing the ratio of probability density functions.

The effect of logging policies on learning performance is discussed, with additional visualizations available in Appendix 7. The effect of logging policies on learning performance is discussed in this section. The stochasticity of the logging policy plays a crucial role in improving the algorithm's policy. By modifying the parameter h0 with a temperature multiplier \u03b1, the policy can become more deterministic as \u03b1 increases. The average ratio of expected test loss to the logging is reported for varying \u03b1 values in the range of 2 [-1,1,...,8]. The text discusses the impact of logging policies on learning performance by adjusting the parameter h0 with a temperature multiplier \u03b1. Increasing \u03b1 leads to a more deterministic policy. NN policies outperform logging policies when h0's stochasticity is sufficient, but learning improved NN policies becomes harder when the temperature parameter exceeds 2/3. The drop in ratios is mainly due to decreased loss of the logging policy. The text discusses how increasing the temperature parameter makes it harder to learn improved neural network policies. Stochasticity does not affect expected loss values, but policies with stronger regularization perform slightly better. As the stochasticity of the logging policy decreases, it becomes harder to improve NN policies. Additionally, as the quality of the logging policy improves, models consistently outperform baselines, but the difficulty also increases. More visualizations of other metrics can be found in the appendix. Our regularization helps improve the model's robustness and generalization performance. As the quality of the logging policy improves, models consistently outperform baselines, but the difficulty also increases. Trade-off between policy accuracy and sampling biases is studied by varying the proportion of training data points used for training the logging policy.
