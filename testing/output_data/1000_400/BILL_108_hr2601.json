    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the US Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for authors to create new works and promotes society's interest in the free flow of ideas and commerce. \"The copyright system provides economic incentives for creators and promotes the free flow of ideas and commerce. The limited copyright term ensures that the public can benefit from artists' work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on a healthy public domain for creating and distributing works.\" The public domain is essential for various industries like book publishing, movie production, and educational institutions. It provides raw material for new creations and allows for the free flow of historical and cultural content on platforms like the World Wide Web. Under current law, copyright protection is granted to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. This prevents entities from building upon and preserving abandoned works. The existing copyright system prevents entities from building upon and preserving abandoned works, contrary to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution and Congress. Older works may not have commercial value but can be useful to historians, artists, and teachers. The dissenting opinion argues that the current copyright system goes against the original intent of the Constitution and Congress by preventing abandoned works from entering the public domain. It is suggested that a mechanism be established to allow abandoned American copyrights to be accessible to the public. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS.
