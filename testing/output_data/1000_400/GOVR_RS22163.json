Both sides are interdependent in terms of security, prosperity, and addressing global challenges such as economic concerns, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and armed conflict. Supporters argue that close cooperation is necessary as neither side can tackle these issues alone. Additionally, the United States and Europe have a strong trade and investment relationship. The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, shared goals, and overlapping interests. Supporters argue that close cooperation is necessary as neither side can tackle global issues alone. The U.S. Congress frequently engages with European counterparts on economic, security, and diplomatic matters. Members of Congress consider the benefits of U.S.-European cooperation in their legislative activities and oversight of foreign policy. Members of Congress engage with European legislators and officials on economic, security, and diplomatic issues, considering the benefits of U.S.-European cooperation. The transatlantic relationship is seen as vital for facing global challenges together. Congressional interest in Europe stems from the need for like-minded partners in addressing global issues. During the Cold War, a more integrated Europe was seen as a way to counter the Soviet Union. Congressional interest in Europe now focuses on the need for like-minded partners in addressing global challenges. The Euro-Atlantic community, including NATO and the EU, has been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe, supported by the U.S. Congress and Administrations. The Euro-Atlantic community, comprising NATO and the EU, has been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The relationship between the United States and the EU is gaining significance due to common decision-making and policy formulation among its 28 member countries. The EU has grown in importance as a key partner for the United States, making common decisions and policies across various areas. Efforts are ongoing to strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy. NATO remains a crucial security institution, with the US playing a leading role. NATO has expanded with 12 new member states since the Cold War, while maintaining Congress's significant interest. The Euro-Atlantic community, led by the United States, has seen significant changes in NATO and the EU over the past two decades. NATO added 12 new member states from Central and Eastern Europe post-Cold War. Discussions on NATO's future role and capabilities have continued, with recent focus on the conflict in Ukraine and relations with Russia. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in the Euro-Atlantic institutions, including EU-wide elections for the European Parliament. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in the Euro-Atlantic institutions. German MEP Martin Schulz was reelected as President of the European Parliament, Jens Stoltenberg became the new Secretary General of NATO, and Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission.

Jean-Claude Juncker became President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs. Donald Tusk later became President of the European Council. Polls show favorable European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under Obama, with constructive transatlantic relations and common approaches to global challenges. The tone of transatlantic relations has been positive in recent years, with common approaches to global challenges. However, there have been frustrations and reality checks along the way. The crisis in Ukraine has led to a reevaluation of European security, with the United States still playing a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. In 2012, there was a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Asia, causing concern among Europeans about U.S. focus on Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has led to a reassessment of European security, with the U.S. still actively involved in NATO and managing relations with Russia. The U.S. expects Europe to take on more responsibility for its own security and play a leading role in regional and international issues. Despite positive transatlantic cooperation, U.S. officials remain worried about Europe's economic challenges. Europe's ongoing economic difficulties, declining defense spending, and questions about its ability to deliver a coherent foreign policy are concerns for U.S. officials assessing the transatlantic partnership. The European financial crisis highlighted the unfinished nature of the EU, with leaders taking unprecedented measures in response. The European financial crisis revealed the EU's unfinished nature, leading to tensions among member states. Anti-establishment sentiment is rising as traditional parties struggle to address economic and social issues, with populist parties gaining strength across Europe. The European financial crisis exposed unresolved issues in the EU, leading to anti-establishment sentiment and the rise of populist parties advocating nationalist and anti-EU policies. These parties gained strength in the 2014 European Parliament election and continued to do so after the victory of the radical-left Syriza party in the 2015 Greek elections. The rise of Euro-skeptic parties in Europe, particularly in the UK, poses challenges to European integration and the EU's partnership with the United States. The 2014 European Parliament election saw far-right and far-left parties gaining significant support, with further tests expected in national elections across various European countries. The UK's upcoming elections, in particular, could have major implications for a possible national referendum on EU membership. Europe's domestic challenges, including political instability, economic struggles, and social unrest, may hinder its ability to collaborate with the US. The deterioration of U.S. and European relations with Russia in 2014 transformed Russia from a \"strategic partner\" to a \"strategic problem.\" Some advocate for pragmatic cooperation with Russia, while others believe a return to previous levels of cooperation is unlikely. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade, with points of contention such as NATO enlargement and the conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008. Despite efforts to improve relations under the Obama Administration, recent Russian actions have hindered progress towards cooperation. The Obama Administration initially improved U.S.-Russia relations through the \"reset\" initiative, leading to cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, signing the New START treaty, and easing tensions on missile defense. However, strains persisted over Russia's policies on Georgia, the CFE Treaty, and criticism of its elections. Moscow strongly reacted to U.S. Congress adopting the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law. Relations between the U.S. and Russia deteriorated due to various issues, including criticism of Russia's elections, the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law, NATO operation in Libya, support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and opposition to UN efforts in Syria. The political crisis in Ukraine further strained relations, bringing them to their lowest point. The 2011 NATO operation in Libya, support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and opposition to U.S. and European efforts in Syria strained relations between the U.S. and Russia. The political crisis in Ukraine in late 2013 worsened relations further, leading to the lowest point in decades. Russia pressured Ukrainian President Yanukovych to reject an EU Association Agreement, resulting in his ousting in 2014. Subsequent support for a more pro-Western government and elections deepened the rift. In February 2014, Ukrainian President Yanukovych was forced from office after protests against turning away from the EU. Russian forces then seized Crimea, justifying the annexation by historical ties and protecting Russian inhabitants. The Russian government justified the annexation of Crimea as rectifying a historical transfer, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population. The annexation is not recognized by the international community, leading to sanctions. The Ukrainian military is engaged in a conflict with self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine, resulting in over 4,300 deaths. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was the first forcible border change in Europe since 1945, leading to a conflict in eastern Ukraine with over 4,300 reported deaths. The United States and Western governments accuse Russia of direct involvement in the conflict, providing military support to separatists. Russia denies these claims, stating they only offer political and humanitarian aid. The U.S. and European governments accuse Russia of direct involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, including providing personnel and material support to separatists. Despite Russia's denial, U.S. and European coordination on responding to the situation has been strong, with aligned analyses and efforts to maximize influence through sanctions. The downing of flight MH17 in 2014 led to the EU expanding sanctions beyond individuals and entities. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia after the shooting down of flight MH17 in 2014, leading to debates over the economic value and political influence of their relationships with Russia. US policy makers express frustration at the EU's process of implementing sanctions. The EU debates over sanctions on Russia, considering trade, investment, finance, and energy. Despite varying attitudes, all 28 EU member states unanimously adopted sanctions as a political imperative, reviewing them monthly with unanimous consensus required to overturn. Observers assert that the EU member states unanimously adopted sanctions on Russia as a political imperative, with a consensus that sending a strong message outweighed economic concerns. The sanctions package, including sectoral sanctions, requires unanimous renewal, with the next review scheduled for July 2015. Russia's economy has been impacted by recession, a weakened ruble, and high inflation, attributed to a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. The effects of sanctions on Russia's foreign policy decisions remain uncertain. Most analysts attribute Russia's economic downturn to a sharp drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. Speculation surrounds Russia's next steps in eastern Ukraine, ranging from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking de-escalation. EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with ceasefire agreement. The EU proposed easing sanctions on Russia if they comply with the ceasefire agreement, but a resurgence of combat in eastern Ukraine in January 2015 led to doubts. With Vladimir Putin expected to remain in power, U.S. and European relations with Russia will continue to be a key focus for policymakers. Members of the 114th Congress should monitor developments in Russia and Ukraine closely. Members of the 114th Congress should closely monitor developments in Russia and Ukraine, including potential adoption of sanctions. Cooperation with European counterparts and support for Ukraine may also be considered. The U.S. provided significant aid to Ukraine in 2014. The US provided $291 million in non-lethal aid and a $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine in 2014. Additional support includes $139 million in bilateral assistance and $350 million in military assistance authorized by the Ukraine Freedom Support Act. The EU has also shown support for Ukraine. The 113th Congress passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, authorizing $350 million in military assistance, including lethal weapons, for Ukraine. The EU signed an Association Agreement with Ukraine and plans to provide over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance. International financial assistance is tied to Ukraine's economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts, sparking debates about NATO's future and altering the US outlook on Europe. Between 2014 and 2020, the United States and the EU have supported IMF and World Bank assistance programs for Ukraine, contingent on economic reforms and anti-corruption measures. Developments in Ukraine have reignited debates about NATO's future and shifted the US perspective on European defense. Russia's actions in Ukraine have prompted calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense, leading to increased defense spending pledges from European countries. The Obama Administration has reassured European allies of US commitment to European security in response to Russian aggression. The Obama Administration has reassured European allies of the U.S. commitment to European security through the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), which includes troop rotations to Poland and the Baltic states and pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe. Congress appropriated $810 million for the initiative in December 2014. The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) extends reassurance measures by the United States in 2014, including troop rotations to Poland and the Baltic states. The U.S. military presence in Europe related to ERI is rotational, with no plans to permanently increase personnel. The U.S. announced plans to close 15 bases in Europe for cost-cutting, but the force level is expected to remain around 67,000 personnel. Discussions about NATO's future were expected to focus on long-term questions before the crisis in Ukraine. The U.S. force level in Europe is expected to remain at approximately 67,000 personnel. Concerns about declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military \"capabilities gap\" persist. European militaries lack important capabilities like strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, helicopters, and intelligence. Some advocate for European defense integration initiatives to address these gaps. European militaries are limited in key capabilities like strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, helicopters, and intelligence. Efforts for defense integration have been modest, with differing views on NATO's focus between out-of-area operations and collective territorial defense. The 2010 NATO summit's Strategic Concept outlines three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. The 2010 NATO summit's Strategic Concept outlines three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. It reaffirms NATO's role in ensuring the collective defense and security of its members, while also emphasizing the need to develop capabilities for expeditionary operations and address unconventional security threats like terrorism, cybersecurity, and energy security. Europe's capabilities for expeditionary operations, counterinsurgency, stabilization, and reconstruction are being developed to confront new security challenges like terrorism, cybersecurity, and energy security. However, public opposition, political will, and resource shortages may hinder Europe's willingness for large-scale missions. Some European countries are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by Russia, with calls for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces in countries like Poland and the Baltic states. This shift in security outlook is reflected in initiatives like the European Reassurance Initiative. The security outlook in many European countries has shifted due to increased perceptions of the threat posed by Russia. Some officials in countries like Poland and the Baltic states have called for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces. The European Reassurance Initiative includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security. NATO has tripled the number of fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. The \"Readiness Action Plan\" agreed upon at NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales is described as the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the Cold War. At NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for enhanced defense measures in Central and Eastern Europe, including pre-positioning equipment and establishing a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) of 4,000 soldiers for rapid deployment. At the NATO Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to establish a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) of 4,000 soldiers for rapid deployment in response to threats against allies. Additionally, allied leaders pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. Tensions between the EU and Russia have raised concerns about European energy security due to the region's heavy dependence on Russian gas imports. Europe's heavy dependence on Russian gas imports raises concerns about energy security. Russia has been using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, seeking bilateral deals with European countries and acquiring ownership of energy infrastructure. Analysts criticize Russia for not following Western standards of transparency and market reciprocity in business practices and investment policies. The possibility of gas cutoffs adds to the worries about European energy security. Russia has actively pursued energy deals with European countries, acquiring ownership of energy infrastructure. Concerns arise over potential gas cutoffs, as seen in past disputes with Ukraine. U.S. officials view European energy security as a priority, wary of Russian dominance impacting transatlantic unity on Russia-related issues. Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with North Africa seen as a potential alternative gas supplier but hindered by political and economic instability. Central Asia's increased supply relies on new pipelines, complicated by Russia's influence. Europe has faced challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with North Africa and Central Asia being potential alternative suppliers. Political and economic instability in North Africa has hindered its role, while Russia has worked to prevent the development of alternative pipelines from Central Asia. European countries are also focusing on renewable energy development, but the contribution remains uncertain. European leaders are striving to create a common energy strategy, including initiatives to liberalize and integrate the internal energy market. European leaders have been working on developing a common energy strategy to coordinate member states' policies, including initiatives to liberalize and integrate the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have increased the urgency for these efforts. Some countries have built LNG terminals, expanded pipeline interconnectivity, and developed the ability to reverse gas flow to mitigate crises. In 2014, then-Prime Minister Tusk of Poland proposed the formation of an EU \"energy union\" to purchase natural gas for all 28 members. In April 2014, then-Prime Minister Tusk of Poland proposed an EU \"energy union\" to purchase natural gas for all 28 members, aiming to introduce more competition and transparency in the energy sector. This would include solidarity mechanisms for member states to aid each other in cases of supply disruption. Before recent events in Ukraine, the EU had adopted legislation to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector by separating gas production from distribution and requiring an independent operator for transit systems. Russia criticized this legislation and canceled the South Stream project in December 2014, which was seen as a response to EU obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia canceled the South Stream project in December 2014, bypassing Ukraine due to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions. The cancellation was seen as a cover to abandon a burdensome project. Russia is diversifying its markets by concluding pipeline construction deals with China and Turkey. The United States and Europe are concerned about the Islamic State's control in Iraq and Syria, with the US leading a coalition to combat the terrorist organization. The emergence and expansion of the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria is a shared concern for the United States and Europe. The US leads a coalition to degrade and destroy IS through military action, while European countries participate in airstrikes and provide support to Iraqi forces. European military action against IS is limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. European countries have pledged trainers, advisers, weapons, and aid to Iraqi forces and Kurdish forces in Iraq. European military action against IS is limited to Iraq, as political and legal challenges hinder involvement in Syria. The EU, alongside the US, condemns the Assad government in Syria and imposes sanctions to target its economic base. The EU has condemned the Assad government in Syria, imposed sanctions, recognized the Syrian National Coalition, and lifted an embargo on arming rebel forces. Concerns about terrorism in Europe were heightened after the 2015 Paris attacks. Support for opposition forces has mainly included non-lethal equipment, humanitarian aid, and training. Concerns about terrorism in Europe increased after the 2015 Paris attacks, leading to raids on Islamic State-linked cells in Belgium. Analysts and European governments are worried about \"foreign fighters\" from Europe joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq, with estimates suggesting 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from Western countries involved. Authorities are concerned about residents of Muslim background traveling to Syria or Iraq to join extremist groups, with estimates of 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from Europe and other Western countries involved in the conflicts. Concerns include the potential for these fighters to return home with extremist views and skills to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe. Authorities are concerned about residents of Muslim background traveling to Syria or Iraq to join extremist groups, with estimates of 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from Europe and other Western countries involved in the conflicts. There is worry that these fighters may return home with enhanced extremist views, training, and weapons skills, potentially carrying out terrorist attacks in Europe. European governments are taking security measures such as increasing surveillance, combating recruitment, and prohibiting travel to address these concerns. Arrests have been made for individuals planning to travel to Syria, confiscating passports, detaining returning fighters, and setting up hotlines for concerned family members. European countries have arrested individuals suspected of planning to travel to Syria or recruiting others, confiscated passports to prevent travel to conflict zones, detained returning fighters, and set up hotlines for concerned family members. However, challenges remain in stemming the flow of European fighters to Syria and Iraq, with differing views among EU member states hindering a unified approach. The EU faces challenges in coordinating counterterrorism efforts due to differing views among member states. The Paris attacks have reignited debates on enhancing security measures, including the potential creation of an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11. The EU and US have strong transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism, with agreements on extradition, legal assistance, container security, and airline passenger data sharing. Efforts include tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force. The United States and the EU have agreements on container security, airline passenger data sharing, and tracking terrorism financing. Bilateral intelligence sharing and law enforcement cooperation are crucial in disrupting terrorist plots. Despite strong overall counterterrorism cooperation, areas of tension exist. The EU and the United States have agreements on container security, airline passenger data sharing, and tracking terrorism financing. While overall counterterrorism cooperation is strong, there are tensions over data privacy safeguards in information-sharing arrangements. The EU has strict regulations protecting personal data and has raised concerns that have complicated and delayed the adoption of certain agreements. Negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement have been ongoing since 2011. The EU and the United States have been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) since 2011. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, aligning with U.S. efforts. Critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient as Hezbollah can still fundraise in Europe. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, aligning with U.S. efforts. Critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient as Hezbollah can still fundraise in Europe. In 2014, the EU General Court ruled to remove Hamas from the terrorist list due to procedural grounds, but the EU External Action Service stated that restrictive measures against Hamas will remain in place. The U.S. and Israel urged the EU to maintain its stance. The EU External Action Service responded that the ruling to remove Hamas from the terrorist list was not a political decision made by EU governments. The United States and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions against Hamas as an appeal process goes forward. Europe has played a central role in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes, with close cooperation between the EU-3, the United States, Russia, and China in negotiations with Iran. Europe has been closely involved in international efforts to address Iran's nuclear program, collaborating with the US, Russia, and China. The EU-3, along with the US, successfully pushed for UN Security Council sanctions on Iran between 2006 and 2010. The EU has also independently imposed sanctions on Iran since 2010, aligning its policy with the US. This shift was highlighted by an EU embargo on Iranian oil in mid-2012, impacting a significant portion of Iran's oil exports. The EU aligned its sanctions policy with the US by imposing restrictions on Iran, including an oil embargo, nuclear technology restrictions, arms embargo, and financial transaction restrictions. Additional measures include enhanced inspection requirements for Iranian vessels and aircraft, visa bans, and asset freezes on individuals involved in Iran's nuclear program. Following the imposition of sanctions by the US, EU, and other international partners on Iran's financial transactions and business activities, restrictions were placed on Iranian cargo vessels and aircraft. Additionally, over 100 individuals involved in Iran's nuclear program were subjected to visa bans and asset freezes, along with more than 480 entities supporting the program. These sanctions led to economic pressure on Iran and a shift in their negotiation stance. Tensions eased after the election of President Hassan Rouhani in 2013, culminating in the agreement on a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013. Following the imposition of sanctions on Iran's financial transactions and business activities, tensions eased after the election of President Hassan Rouhani in 2013. The P5+1 and Iran agreed to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013, requiring Iran to freeze some nuclear activities in exchange for limited sanctions relief. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) was agreed upon by the P5+1 and Iran in November 2013, with Iran required to freeze some nuclear activities in exchange for limited sanctions relief from the IAEA. The relief measures include various suspensions and increased thresholds for financial transfers. The terms of the JPA have been extended twice, with negotiations ongoing to reach a final deal. However, significant differences remain, raising concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities and regional influence. The negotiations for a final deal with Iran are ongoing, but significant differences remain. Concerns persist about Iran's potential to develop a nuclear weapon and increase its regional power. The EU-3 foreign ministers and EU High Representative oppose new U.S. sanctions at this stage, fearing it could jeopardize the talks. The diplomatic quartet, including the U.S., EU, Russia, and the UN, has been mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The United States, European Union, Russia, and the United Nations are part of the diplomatic quartet trying to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU supports a \"two-state\" solution for a sustainable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Recent talks in April 2014 were unsuccessful, and with ongoing conflicts, a negotiated settlement seems unlikely in the near future. European officials emphasize the importance of U.S. engagement in resolving the conflict. The recent round of Israeli-Palestinian talks in April 2014 ended without success. European countries' support for Palestinians has raised concerns in Israel about international isolation. Several European nations have passed resolutions in favor of recognizing a Palestinian state. Lieberman highlighted European support for Palestinians as Israel's top diplomatic challenge. Several European countries, including Sweden, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, have passed resolutions in support of recognizing a Palestinian state. Concerns in Israel also include potential economic repercussions from reduced cooperation with the EU and international debates on Palestinian statehood and possible ICC investigations. Israel has concerns about reduced economic cooperation with the EU due to debates on Palestinian statehood and possible ICC investigations. The EU has imposed restrictions on funding for Israeli organizations in certain settlements, but analysts believe these measures do not pose a significant economic threat. The EU has debated labeling products from settlements in Bank, East Jerusalem, or Golan Heights, but analysts believe it won't harm Israel's economy significantly. High Representative Mogherini stated that there are no plans for sanctions, but rather a focus on restarting peace talks. Reports suggest the EU may offer financial incentives for a successful peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The EU is not considering sanctions but aims to motivate peace talks.

Some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship. The fallout from NSA surveillance reports has raised concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards and access to European citizens' personal data. European leaders' outrage may be more for domestic consumption, as they are aware of their own security services' surveillance activities and cooperation with U.S. intelligence. Despite political trust issues, cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence and security services continues, especially in light of the threat posed by the Islamic State and returning foreign fighters. The diminishing Arctic sea ice has increased human activities in the region and sparked interest in its future, including the Northern Sea Route along the Siberian coast of Russia. The cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence and security services remains strong despite political trust issues. The melting Arctic ice is leading to increased human activities in the region, with implications for various sectors such as fisheries, tourism, and resource exploration. The United States will chair the Arctic Council in May 2015. The Arctic Council, established in 1996, is a key forum for cooperation among the eight Arctic countries. It addresses various issues such as regional development, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction. The United States will take over the chairmanship in May 2015. The Arctic Council, consisting of eight Arctic countries, addresses regional development, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction.
