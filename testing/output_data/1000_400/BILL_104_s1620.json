    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996\" and pertains to dredged material disposal facilities. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects, considering them as a general navigation feature for cost sharing. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 now includes provisions for dredged material disposal facilities as a general navigation feature for cost sharing in Federal navigation projects. No federal funds can be used for construction until eligible funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are exhausted. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 allows for the maintenance of Federal navigation projects using funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for a project cannot exceed $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Eligible costs must cover commercial navigation expenses. The Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for a project under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is limited to $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Eligible costs include constructing dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects and maintaining these facilities. The Federal government covers costs for operation and maintenance of Federal navigation projects, including dredged material disposal facilities and environmental dredging for contaminated sediments. The Federal government covers costs for operation and maintenance of Federal navigation projects, including dredged material disposal facilities and environmental dredging for contaminated sediments in critical port and harbor areas to facilitate maritime commerce and navigation. Preference is given to port areas where annual harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures for eligible projects reimbursed from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Secretary gives preference to port areas where harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures for eligible projects reimbursed from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund when providing a dredged material disposal facility. This applies to facilities or navigation projects without awarded construction contracts before the enactment of this subsection. The construction of facilities or navigation projects without awarded contracts before the enactment of this subsection must be amended to conform to new provisions regarding the Federal share of project costs. The agreement between the Secretary and a non-Federal interest must be amended to align with new provisions, including the Federal share of project costs for dredged material disposal facilities. The amendment applies prospectively and does not increase the non-Federal share of costs for any dredged material disposal facility."
