The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food, the FDA's labeling requirements, and the right of individuals to know if their food was genetically engineered for various reasons. Over 60 countries, including the UK and EU countries, already require labeling for genetically engineered foods. The United States recognizes individuals' right to know if their food was genetically engineered for health, economic, environmental, religious, and ethical reasons. Over 60 countries, including the UK, EU, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, and China, mandate labeling of genetically engineered food. The Codex Alimentarius allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification of such foods can help preserve the economy. The United Nations allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods, which can help preserve economic value in exports or sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving in vitro nucleic acid techniques or fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to organisms produced through genetic engineering techniques, including recombinant DNA, direct nucleic acid injection, and cell fusion across different taxonomic families. This definition also includes the progeny of organisms created through genetic engineering processes. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from an organism produced through genetic engineering, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular changes, and regardless of the organism's suitability for human consumption. This definition is included in an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amendment states that a guaranty is required for food misbranded under section 403(z) to avoid penalties. The guaranty must be signed and contain the name of the recipient. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires a guaranty for misbranded food under section 403(z). The guaranty must be signed and include the name and address of the recipient in the United States. It should also state that the food is not genetically engineered. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires a signed guaranty for misbranded food, stating that the food is not genetically engineered. The guaranty exempts the recipient from penalties regardless of how the food is used. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amendment mandates a guaranty for misbranded food, specifying that it is not genetically engineered. This exempts the recipient from penalties for violations related to misbranded food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amendment requires a guaranty for misbranded food that is not genetically engineered, exempting recipients from penalties for violations related to misbranded food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amendment exempts agricultural producers from penalties for misbranded food contamination with genetically engineered material. The Secretary must establish labeling requirements for food contamination with genetically engineered material within one year of the Act's enactment. The exemption for agricultural producers from penalties applies unless contamination is due to the producer's negligence."
