Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) addresses the challenge of generating diverse classification weights for query samples by maximizing mutual information between weights and data. This approach is a novel contribution in the field. AWGIM aims to generate diverse classification weights for query samples by maximizing mutual information between weights and data, a novel approach in few shot learning. This method proves effective in achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, addressing the limitations of deep learning methods that require large amounts of labeled data. Few shot learning and meta learning are proposed to enable deep models to learn from very few samples, addressing the limitations of deep learning methods that require large amounts of labeled data. Meta learning approaches extract high-level knowledge across different tasks to adapt quickly to new tasks. Meta learning is a popular approach for few shot problems, with different methods like gradient-based and metric-based approaches. Weight generation methods have shown effectiveness in generating classification weights for tasks with limited labeled data. However, fixed classification weights for query samples within a task may not be optimal due to the few shot nature of the problem. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced to address limitations in generating classification weights for different tasks with limited labeled data. AWGIM generates classification weights specifically for each query sample by utilizing two encoding paths where the query sample attends to the task context. Simple cross attention between query samples and support set is shown to be insufficient in guaranteeing classification weights fitted to diverse query data, leading to the proposal of a new approach. AWGIM introduces a method to generate classification weights for each query sample by maximizing mutual information between weights and query, support data. It is the first to use Variational Information Maximization in few shot learning, with minimal computational overhead. AWGIM eliminates inner updates without sacrificing performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

It uses Variational Information Maximization in few shot learning with minimal computational overhead. AWGIM achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and eliminates inner updates without compromising performance. Previous methods in few shot learning include meta learning approaches like optimal initialization for all tasks and meta-learner LSTM. In gradient-based approaches, optimal initialization is learned for all tasks. Meta-learner LSTM is used to optimize few-shot classification tasks. Metric-based methods learn a similarity metric between query and support samples. Some works consider spatial information or local image descriptors for richer similarities. Generating classification weights directly has been explored by other works. Some works explore generating classification weights directly, using methods such as linear combinations or feature extractor activations. Other approaches include using graph neural network denoising autoencoders and generating \"fast weights\" from loss gradients. Generative models are also used for few-shot classification to generate additional data. Munkhdalai & Yu (2017) proposed generating \"fast weights\" from loss gradients for each task, without considering different weights for query examples or maximizing mutual information. Other methods for few-shot classification include using generative models to generate more data, closed-form solutions for classification, and integrating label propagation on a transductive graph. Attention mechanisms have shown success in computer vision and natural language processing by modeling interactions between queries and key-value pairs. In computer vision and natural language processing, attention mechanisms model interactions between queries and key-value pairs. This work uses self and cross attention to encode task and query-task information, focusing on few-shot image classification by maximizing mutual information. This contrasts with regression approaches that optimize variational objectives based on stochastic processes and mutual information between random variables x and y. This work focuses on few-shot image classification using attention to maximize mutual information between random variables x and y. Mutual information measures the decrease of uncertainty in one variable when another is known, and has various applications in machine learning tasks such as Generative Adversarial Networks and self-supervised learning. The text discusses how mutual information is maximized between variables x and y in few-shot image classification using attention mechanisms. This approach has applications in tasks like Generative Adversarial Networks and self-supervised learning. The attentive path equips query samples with task knowledge, achieved through an attention mechanism. The weight generator uses concatenated representations to generate classification weights specific to x, enhancing the lower bound of mutual information.

It introduces a model to generate classification weights specific to x, enhancing mutual information. The problem formulation, model description, objective function, and theoretical analysis are provided. The problem is formulated under episodic training paradigm for N-way K-shot tasks. The text discusses meta-learning methods for few-shot classification tasks. It introduces the episodic training paradigm for N-way K-shot tasks, where support and query sets are used for model optimization. The proposed approach aims to generate classification weights for improved model performance during meta-training and meta-testing. The model needs to quickly adapt to novel tasks by transferring knowledge across disjoint classes.

The model needs to adapt quickly to novel tasks by transferring knowledge across disjoint classes. The proposed approach follows a general framework with a feature extractor and a meta-learner generating classification weights for different tasks. The Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO) method is related to this work, where latent code z is generated by h conditioned on the support set S. In Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO), the latent code z is generated by h conditioned on the support set S. Classification weights w can be decoded from z with l. The objective function of LEO aims to minimize a certain loss function. In Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO), the objective function aims to minimize a loss function using new classification weights w generated by l. LEO learns a lower-dimensional latent space to avoid updating high-dimensional w in the inner loop. Unlike AWGIM, LEO does not require inner updates and generates fixed weights based on the support set within one task. The proposed method involves using a feature extractor to process images in a sampled task, generating classification weights through contextual and attentive paths, and maximizing lower-dimensional latent space for classification. The method involves using a feature extractor to process images in a sampled task, generating classification weights through contextual and attentive paths, and maximizing lower-dimensional latent space for classification. The encoding process includes two paths, the contextual path and attentive path, which aim to learn representations for the support set and individual query sample respectively. The generated classification weights predict the label of the query sample and maximize mutual information between variables. The contextual path focuses on learning representations for the support set using a multi-head self-attention network. Existing methods generate classification weights based on the support set only, leading to sub-optimal weights. To address this, the attentive path allows individual query examples to generate adaptive classification weights by attending to the task context. The attentive path introduces adaptive classification weights by allowing individual query examples to attend to the task context, unlike the contextual path which focuses on learning representations for the support set. This approach ensures that the classification weights are adaptive to different query samples and aware of the task context. The contextual path in f ap sa differs from f cp sa as it emphasizes generating classification weights. Self-attention in f ap sa provides value context for query samples in cross attention. Sharing self-attention networks may limit representation expressiveness. Multi-head attention is used in both paths to learn comprehensive representations. More details can be found in A.2. Replicated X cp and X ap for different query samples. The contextual path in f ap sa focuses on generating classification weights using multi-head attention. X cp and X ap are replicated for different query samples, reshaped, and concatenated to form X cp\u2295ap. This allows each query sample to have its own latent representations for support set, generating specific classification weights. The weights generator g outputs the distribution of the classification weights. The classification weights for each query sample are generated by a weights generator that outputs a Gaussian distribution. The sampled weights are represented as W, with the mean value computed for each class. The prediction for query and support data is computed using the final classification weight matrix. The prediction for query and support data is computed using the final classification weight matrix. The weights generator outputs a Gaussian distribution for each query sample, generating specific classification weight matrices. Additionally, two decoders reconstruct Xcp and Xap using the generated weights as inputs. The use of reconstruction as auxiliary tasks is discussed in the following section. In this section, the analysis is performed for one query sample without loss of generality. The classification weights generated from two paths are not sensitive to different query samples, indicating that the information from the attentive path is not well preserved during weight generation. To address this limitation, the proposal is to maximize the mutual information. The proposal aims to maximize the mutual information between generated weights and support/query data to address the limitation of information preservation during weight generation. This involves using Variational Information Maximization to compute a lower bound of the mutual information. The proposal utilizes Variational Information Maximization to compute a lower bound of mutual information, addressing the issue of information preservation during weight generation. The objective function is derived by maximizing the log likelihood of labels for support and query data. The objective function is derived by maximizing the log likelihood of labels for support and query data with respect to the network parameters, using Gaussian distributions to approximate the true posterior distribution. The loss function for training the network involves reconstructing data with L2 loss and determining the weightage for each term. The loss function for training the network involves reconstructing data with L2 loss and determining the weightage for each term using hyper-parameters. The generated classification weights are forced to carry information about the support data and specific query samples. In LEO, the inner update loss is computed as cross entropy on support data, but weight generation does not involve specific query samples, making reconstructing x ap impossible. The inner update loss in LEO is computed as cross entropy on support data. Weight generation does not involve specific query samples, making reconstructing x ap impossible. LEO can be seen as a special case of the proposed method with only contextual path and \u03bb 2 = \u03bb 3 = 0. The computational complexity of the encoding process in contextual path is O((N K) 2) due to self-attention. The computational complexity of the attentive path is O((N K) 2 + |Q|(N K)), with a total complexity of O((N K) 2 + |Q|(N K)). The value of (N K) 2 is usually negligible in few-shot learning problems. AWGIM reduces training and inference time significantly by avoiding inner updates without compromising performance. Empirical evaluation on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets shows its effectiveness compared to other methods. Both datasets are subsets of ILSVRC-12 dataset, with miniImageNet containing 100 classes and 600 images per class. The computational complexity of AWGIM is O((N K) 2 + |Q|(N K)), but the overhead is negligible due to parallel implementation of cross attention. We conduct experiments on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, subsets of ILSVRC-12 dataset, to compare with other methods. miniImageNet has 100 classes with 600 images each, while tieredImageNet has 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in ImageNet hierarchy. Image features from LEO are used, which trained a 28-layer Wide Residual Network. The study uses image features from LEO and a 28-layer Wide Residual Network trained on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets. 351 classes are used for meta-training, 97 for meta-validation, and 160 for meta-testing. Each image is represented by a 640-dimensional vector for N-way K-shot experiments. During meta-testing, 600 N-way K-shot tasks are sampled from the meta-testing set. During meta-testing, 600 N-way K-shot tasks are sampled from the meta-testing set. The study uses TensorFlow to implement their method with a feature embedding dimension of 640.

The backbone network structure of the feature extractor is provided for reference. Results on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet are shown in Table 1 and 2, categorizing methods into different meta learning categories. The bottom part of the tables displays classification weights generation approaches, with AWGIM outperforming all methods in the top parts. AWGIM also shows competitive performance compared to other methods in the bottom part, being the best on tieredImageNet and close to the state-of-the-art on miniImageNet. All classification weights generation methods use WRN-28-10 as the backbone network for fair comparison. AWGIM demonstrates competitive performance compared to other classification weights generation methods, outperforming LEO in all settings. Detailed analysis and comparison with LEO are provided in Table 3. The attentive path is removed in the top half for comparison, while ablation analysis of different components is conducted in the bottom part. Random shuffling of generated classification weights confirms their optimality for various query samples. In Table 3, detailed analysis of AWGIM is provided, comparing it to LEO. Different generators and their performance are discussed, showing that self-attention is as effective as relation networks in LEO. The performance of \"Generator conditioned on S only\" is comparable to \"Generator in LEO\" without inner update, indicating that self-attention is as effective as relation networks in modeling task-context. By replacing attention modules with 2-layer MLPs in \"MLP encoding\", accuracy close to LEO can still be achieved, but performance drops significantly if \u03bb 1 = \u03bb 2 = \u03bb 3 = 0. In \"MLP encoding\", one MLP is used for support set and another for query samples. Even without attention, \"MLP encoding\" achieves accuracy close to LEO. Setting \u03bb 1 = \u03bb 2 = \u03bb 3 = 0 significantly drops performance, highlighting the importance of information maximization. Ablation analysis on \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , and \u03bb 3 shows that maximizing mutual information between weights and support is crucial for accuracy. In the context of maximizing mutual information between weights and support, the classification weights in AWGIM are tailored for each query sample. Shuffling the weights between query samples within the same classes and between different classes is done to assess their adaptability. The importance of support label prediction for information maximization is highlighted, with noticeable performance effects when \u03bb 1 = 0. The classification weights in AWGIM are generated specifically for each query sample, with shuffling done to study their adaptability. Results show that shuffling between classes degrades accuracy, while shuffling within the same class has minimal effect. This suggests that when support data is limited, weights for query samples from the same class are similar, but distinct for different classes. In the study, random shuffling between classes negatively impacts accuracy in 5-way 1-shot experiments, while shuffling within the same class has minimal effect. With more labeled data in the support set, both shuffling methods show similar results in 5-way 5-shot experiments, indicating more diverse classification weights. Larger support sets provide more knowledge to estimate optimal weights for each query example. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced for few-shot image classification.

During meta-training, weights are sampled from a Gaussian distribution for classification. It can also be adapted for few shot regression tasks by modifying the loss function. During meta-training, weights are sampled from a Gaussian distribution for classification. AWGIM can be adapted for few shot regression tasks by setting the number of classes to 1 and modifying the loss function to mean square error. The model generates weight and bias parameters for a three-layer MLP with hidden dimension 40, consistent with few shot regression settings in LEO. Sinusoidal and linear regression tasks are constructed, with multi-head attention improving performance in experiments on the miniImageNet dataset. The study compares AWGIM with LEO in terms of convergence speed and performance on few-shot regression tasks using multi-head attention.
