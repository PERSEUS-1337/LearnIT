    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and the final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016. The conference committee resolved differences between the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016, highlighting selected personnel-related issues of high congressional and constituent interest. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for each issue discussed. The report discusses issues addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and provides background on authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001. Congress increased personnel strength for the Army and Marine Corps in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but began reversing these increases in recent years. Authorized end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have fluctuated in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recent years have seen decreases in end-strengths due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House bill approving higher end-strengths than requested. The FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House bill approving higher end-strengths than requested. The House-proposed increase was most noticeable for the Army, although the Marine Corps and Air Force also increased. The Navy end-strength was reduced in the House bill but still higher than the Administration's request. The final bill set minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The final bill set the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017, which was still higher than the Administration request by 1,715. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four of the seven reserve components and increases for two. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. The Senate bill proposed end-strengths identical to the Administration request, while the House bill would have increased the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. There is increasing concern with the overall cost of military personnel and focus on the military pay raise. Increasing concern with the overall cost of military personnel has led to a focus on the military pay raise. The annual increase in basic pay is determined by a formula indexed to the Employment Cost Index, with a 2.1% increase for 2017 unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. Basic pay increases are typically effective at the start of the calendar year. The annual increase in basic pay for 2017 will be 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. In the past three years, the President set the pay raise below the ECI using alternative pay adjustment authority. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed for a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers, while the Senate bill proposed waiving the automatic adjustment to basic pay. The President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The enacted bill specified an increase of 2.1%, effective January 1, 2017, waiving the automatic adjustment to basic pay. Under current law, all servicemembers are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status to provide housing for servicemembers. A Senate bill proposed changes to base BAH solely on paygrade and location, removing dependency as a factor. The Senate bill proposed changes to the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) calculation, focusing on paygrade and geographic location rather than dependency status. It would base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade and adjust the allowance for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The new BAH formula, effective January 1, 2018, adjusts the allowance for servicemembers sharing living quarters based on the total number of occupants. This change applies to certain members of the Armed Forces, including those who first receive basic pay on or after January 1, 2018, reserve and retired personnel on active duty, and servicemembers who lose eligibility for BAH after December 31, 2017. The new BAH formula, effective January 1, 2018, adjusts the allowance for servicemembers based on the total number of occupants. Certain reserve and retired personnel ordered to active duty, as well as servicemembers entitled to BAH on December 31, 2017, may lose eligibility for BAH after that date. The Senate provision requires the Secretary of Defense to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017, while the enacted bill mandates a report on transitioning to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017. The enacted bill requires the Department of Defense to provide a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee by March 1, 2017, on transitioning to a new pay structure that eliminates Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The provision aims to create a \"single-salary pay system\" to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. The conference report acknowledges the evolution of BAH as an entitlement over the past 20 years, intended to offset housing costs in high-cost areas for servicemembers. The evolution of BAH among servicemembers over the past 20 years has led to a call for transitioning to a salary system that aligns the payment of the allowance with its use as compensation rather than its original purpose as a housing benefit. The evolution of BAH among servicemembers over the past 20 years has led to a call for transitioning to a salary system that aligns the payment of the allowance with its use as compensation rather than its original purpose as a housing benefit. The Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for this transition in alignment with the Department's use of the housing allowance as compensation. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce costs. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for new servicemembers and those with 12 years or less of service. The system historically serves as a retention incentive for the military force. The military retirement system will undergo changes on January 1, 2018, affecting new servicemembers and those with 12 years or less of service. Concerns have been raised about the ability to retain certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point due to reductions in the retired pay multiplier. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the completion of 12 years of service. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the completion of 12 years of service. A provision in the bill allows DOD to pay continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service in exchange for a 3-year commitment. This gives DOD more flexibility in managing personnel based on retention trends for specific military occupational specialties. Additionally, the bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. Section 633 of the enacted bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members, ensuring equal pay for reserve component members on active duty. Section 635 would have recommended default contributions to the TSP be to a Roth plan, beneficial for young, low-income individuals. The sense of Congress was not adopted to default contributions to the TSP to a Roth plan, which is beneficial for young, low-income individuals. Section 631 allows cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system. Cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, have a 30-day election period for the new retirement system after commissioning or transfer to active duty. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 qualifying years of service. Congress enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act in 1982. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. Servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service, with up to 50% divisible in divorce cases. Congressional reports and amendments have modified the USFSPA over the years. The amount of retired pay due to a servicemember is calculated based on pay grade and years of service at retirement. Currently, up to 50% of disposable military retired pay can be divided in a divorce case. Proposed changes would use pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The enacted bill authorizes this change and includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. This provision does not affect prior divorce settlements. The provision authorizes changes in the definition of disposable retired pay and includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. It does not impact prior divorce settlements. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a monthly survivor benefit to eligible recipients, usually 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, the base amount for those who died on active duty was 75% of their basic pay, but this was changed in the FY2017 NDAA to address disparate treatment. Reservists who die during inactive-duty training receive a lower SBP payment based on their years of service. The FY2017 NDAA addressed disparate treatment in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments for reservists who die during inactive-duty training. Surviving spouses receiving SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, offset by the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill amend provisions in Title 10, United States Code to eliminate differential treatment under the SBP for reserve members. The enacted bill extends the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) and amends provisions in Title 10, United States Code to eliminate differential treatment under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for reserve members who die during inactive-duty training. It also allows the Department of Defense to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) when retired pay is insufficient to cover the premiums. Section 646 of the enacted bill extends the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) until May 31, 2018, and requires a report on affected individuals within 90 days. Nearly 65,000 surviving spouses are estimated to receive SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), with recommendations to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. In FY2018, 65,000 surviving spouses are set to receive the SSIA. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of the SBP by a federally funded research center, with a report to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other sectors, and explore alternative survivor benefit options. The curr_chunk discusses the feasibility of providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products, specifically focusing on TRICARE and proposed changes to health care enrollment fees. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred options. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including replacing Prime, Standard, and Extra options with Select and Preferred options. The proposals included new enrollment fees, deductibles, co-pays, and increased pharmacy costs for retirees and military family members. This would result in discretionary savings in the Defense Health Program appropriations account and reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and increased pharmacy costs for retirees and military family members. This would result in discretionary savings in the Defense Health Program appropriations account and reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures. The proposal also includes increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, but not active duty members. The TRICARE for Life program is funded through the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, with contributions from each uniformed service member. The TRICARE for Life program is funded by contributions from uniformed service members. The proposed changes to TRICARE in the FY2017 Budget include new enrollment fees, deductibles, and increased pharmacy costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates savings and costs associated with TRICARE proposals, including the establishment of a new TRICARE Select health plan option. The enacted bill includes provisions to establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option, set enrollment fees and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018, and create an open enrollment period for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. The enacted bill includes provisions for a new TRICARE Select health plan option, enrollment fees, and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. It also establishes an open enrollment period for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, limits pre-authorization requirements, and requires a pilot program on value-based healthcare methodology. The enacted bill includes provisions for a new TRICARE Select health plan option, enrollment fees, and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. It also establishes an open enrollment period for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, limits pre-authorization requirements, and requires a pilot program on value-based healthcare methodology. The bill also proposes changes to TRICARE beneficiary cost-sharing and pharmacy co-payments. The enacted bill includes provisions for a new TRICARE Select health plan option, enrollment fees, and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018. It also establishes an open enrollment period for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, limits pre-authorization requirements, and requires a pilot program on value-based healthcare methodology. The bill proposes changes to TRICARE beneficiary cost-sharing and pharmacy co-payments, including increasing co-pays for pharmaceuticals and establishing a new enrollment fee for future enrollees in the TRICARE-for-Life program. The bill consolidates TRICARE Standard and Extra into a new TRICARE Preferred plan or a new TRICARE Choice plan. Section 701 of the enacted bill amends Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code to specify cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members, retirees under the new TRICARE Select and existing TRICARE Prime options, with fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions to cost-sharing amounts will be provided to disability retirees, their dependents, and survivors, while cost-sharing for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries remains unchanged. The new TRICARE Select health plan option includes fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions to cost-sharing amounts will be provided to disability retirees, their dependents, and survivors. A \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. Retired TRICARE beneficiaries eligible before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. The report will review changes in health care coverage, appointment access, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries without a referral must obtain a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge. The Secretary of Defense will establish access standards for TRICARE, including network provider acceptance and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries without a referral must get a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. TRICARE beneficiaries can access a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Generic medications are preferred over brand-name medications. Non-formulary medicines are generally not available at military pharmacies. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual increases in co-payments to save $300 million in FY2017. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual increases in co-payments to save $300 million in FY2017. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase, while previous NDAA bills had overridden statutory increases with a $3 increase in pharmacy co-pays. Section 702 of the FY2016 NDAA substituted a $3 increase in pharmacy co-pays, effective February 1, 2016. The Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical facilities and authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs of little value. Section 702 of the FY2016 NDAA allowed the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs of little value from coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries, potentially saving $640 million in pharmacy costs over 2017-2021. It also aimed to reduce net health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. CBO estimated that implementing Section 702 would reduce DOD's net discretionary pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decrease net health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. Additionally, it would lower accrual payments into the MERHCF by about $1.5 billion over 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services and manage the TRICARE program. It oversees shared services and acts as the market manager for the National Capital Region enhanced Multi-Service Market. The implementation of Section 702 would reduce DOD's pharmacy costs and health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was formed on October 1, 2013, as a joint combat support agency to enable Armed Forces medical services. It manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs). The agency aims to improve operational medical force readiness, beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and lower total management costs. The conferees recommend consolidating all military treatment facilities under a single agency to improve operational medical force readiness, beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and lower management costs. They believe the current structure of three separate health systems managed by each Service hinders innovation and decision-making, and a streamlined management structure would lead to true reform and better care experience. The conferees propose consolidating military treatment facilities under a single agency to enhance operational medical force readiness, improve access to care, and lower management costs. This streamlined approach aims to eliminate redundancy, increase efficiency, and lead to true reform of the military health system. Section 702 of the enacted bill assigns the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for the administration of each MTF, including budget, IT, healthcare management, and construction. The enacted bill assigns the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for the administration of military treatment facilities, including budget, IT, healthcare management, and construction. It also establishes a professional staff within the agency to oversee MTF administration and codifies the roles of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors on health and medical matters. Section 702 of the enacted bill codifies the roles and responsibilities of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors on health and medical matters. It also requires the Secretary to develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office is tasked with reviewing the DOD implementation plan. The provision in Section 703 of the bill adds a new section to the United States Code requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces. This includes medical centers, hospitals, ambulatory care centers, and satellite centers in areas where civilian facilities cannot meet the healthcare needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. The provision in Section 703 of the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities, including centers, to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian health care facilities are unable to meet the healthcare needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. The current law for reserve component enlistees requires them to be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previously served in the Armed Forces. Citizenship requirements may be waived if enlistment is deemed vital to national interest. The Senate bill proposed tying reserve component enlistment requirements to active component citizenship/residency requirements, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. The Senate bill proposed amending reserve component enlistment requirements to align with active component citizenship/residency requirements, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave to attract and retain talent in the Armed Forces. Ashton Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave in the DOD to attract and retain talent in the Armed Forces. Maternity leave extended to 12 weeks, and parental leave sought to be extended to 14 days. Parental leave for servicemembers was first authorized in 2009 for a maximum of 10 days, and for adoption, up to 21 days since 2006. Parental leave for servicemembers was first authorized in 2009 for a maximum of 10 days, and for adoption, up to 21 days since 2006. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 allows for up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers could receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense is required to define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 allows for up to 12 weeks of parental leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers could receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense is required to define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers for this leave benefit. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 allows for parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers, with up to 12 weeks for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. The Secretary of Defense must define the roles of primary and secondary caregivers. Additionally, Section 521 of the final bill prohibits any leave from being awarded to military servicemembers outside of what is authorized by statute. The bill adopted a provision prohibiting unauthorized military leave, with supporters of paid parental leave arguing it enhances recruitment and retention. Opponents fear it may impact military readiness. The bill aims to improve Armed Forces benefits to boost recruitment and retention, including extending maternity and parental leave. Opponents are concerned about potential negative impacts on military readiness. Congress has been focused on improving the Defense Commissary system, with funding authorized in FY2016 exceeding the President's budget request. In FY2016, Congress authorized $1.4 billion for commissary funding, $100 million more than the President's budget request. The President's FY2017 budget proposed $1.2 billion, a reduction of $200 million in subsidies for stateside commissaries from FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required a report for budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The FY2016 NDAA required a report for budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The report released by DOD on June 7, 2016 acknowledged that privatization would not replicate the benefits provided by DeCA while achieving budget neutrality. Critics argue that unknowns need to be fully evaluated before initiating a pilot program. Section 651 directed the Comptroller General to assess DOD's plan. Some critics argue that unknowns should be fully evaluated before starting a pilot program. The assessment of DOD's plan highlighted the lack of a clear strategy to achieve budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018. The report addressed some benchmarks but lacked specific metrics for each. The DOD's plan lacks a clear strategy to achieve budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018. The report addressed some benchmarks but lacked specific metrics for each. Additionally, a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense is pending. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense. Sections 661 and 662 of the bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card at commissaries. These reforms aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, provide value for taxpayers, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. The conference report highlights reforms to the commissary system, including allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and accepting the Military Star Card as payment. These changes aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, provide value for taxpayers, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. Additional reforms include congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. The enacted bill allows DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and offer private label goods with a markup to offset operating costs. CBO estimates a minimal decrease in direct spending over the next decade. DOD is required to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchanges to reduce reliance on appropriated funds while maintaining commissary benefits and revenue. The enacted bill requires DOD to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchanges to reduce reliance on appropriated funds. Commissaries could use flexible product pricing to maintain savings levels. DOD may convert DeCA to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months, ensuring no loss in pay for employees. Commercial grocery industry experts may assist in the transformation. The Defense Secretary must ensure no loss in pay for current DeCA employees if conversion to a non-appropriated fund entity occurs. DOD can contract commercial grocery industry experts to help transform the commissary system. Acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores is authorized. The Defense Secretary must ensure no loss in pay for current DeCA employees if conversion to a non-appropriated fund entity occurs. DOD can contract commercial grocery industry experts to help transform the commissary system. Acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores is authorized. Payment for goods and services at commissary stores can be made using a credit card. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services to support servicemembers and veterans in translating military skills into post-service education and employment opportunities. Notable programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program. The final bill eliminates the requirement for credentialing programs to be accredited by third-party bodies, instead focusing on meeting quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 mandate DOD reports on specific transition initiatives for servicemembers. Section 561 of the Senate version, which aimed to limit tuition assistance funds to education and training contributing to professional development, was not adopted. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on transition initiatives for servicemembers, including obtaining merchant mariner licenses, assessing college credit for military skills, and evaluating the JTEST-AI program. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, with Section 564 requiring DOD to provide information and applications for TWIC cards as part of TAP. Sections 562 and 563 mandate DOD notification for servicemembers. Section 566 of the House bill, authorizing DOD to provide job placement services to reserve component members, was not adopted. The House bill did not adopt a program to provide job placement services directly to reserve component members. General and flag officers hold the most important military positions in the DOD. General and flag officers (GFOs) hold key military positions in the DOD, with ranks ranging from 1-star to 4-star. The number of GFOs in each grade is limited by statute, and Congress periodically reviews their roles and compensation. Section 910 of the House bill aimed to set rank requirements for service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders. Congress periodically reviews and revises the number, duties, and compensation of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the Armed Forces. Section 910 of the House bill proposed rank limitations for service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders, while Section 911 suggested the establishment of a new unified combatant command for cyber operations. The Senate bill aimed to reduce the number of authorized active and reserve GFOs by 25% by December 31, 2017. The Senate bill proposed reducing the number of authorized active and reserve General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 25%, with a focus on higher-ranking GFOs. It also aimed to eliminate certain statutory grade requirements in various military communities and senior staff positions. Under the proposed Senate language, the number of authorized active and reserve General and Flag Officers (GFOs) would drop to 111. The bill would eliminate certain statutory grade requirements in various military communities and senior staff positions, allowing the Department of Defense to set grades at different levels while still managing GFO numbers within specified caps. The Secretary of Defense is required to reduce the total number of GFOs on active duty by 110 by December 31, 2022, amounting to an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to reduce the total number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) on active duty by 110 by December 31, 2022, which is an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The reductions will be distributed among the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and joint pool. Additionally, there is a temporary allocation of 30 additional GFO positions to the joint pool for contingency operations. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to adjust these reductions in the interest of national security, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees required within 30 days. The Secretary of Defense is required to reduce the number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 110 by 2022, distributed among the military branches and joint pool. An additional 30 GFO positions are allocated for contingency operations. The Secretary can adjust these reductions for national security, with notification to Congress. A global manpower study is also mandated to justify GFO positions and identify a further 10% reduction by April 1, 2017. A study is mandated to justify General and Flag Officer positions, with a 10% reduction in authorized positions. Results are to be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2017. Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. addresses the management of active duty officers trained in joint matters. There is debate over the current qualification requirements for joint qualified officers. Joint matters involve unified action by integrated military forces across different domains. The management of active duty officers trained in joint matters involves unified action by integrated military forces across different domains such as land, sea, or air, in space, or in the information environment. To become a joint qualified officer, specific joint professional military education requirements must be completed, along with a \"full tour of duty in a joint assignment\" or other assignments demonstrating mastery of joint matters. Joint duty assignments are typically at least two years for general and flag officers. To become a joint qualified officer, specific joint professional military education requirements must be completed, along with a \"full tour of duty in a joint assignment\" or other assignments demonstrating mastery of joint matters. Joint duty assignments are typically at least two years for general and flag officers, with the possibility of a waiver by the Secretary of Defense. Both House and Senate bills aimed to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers, expanding the definition of joint matters to encompass a broader range of duties and positions. The bills aimed to standardize joint duty assignments at two years for all officers, expanding the definition of joint matters to include a broader range of duties. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to designate additional joint matters. The enacted bill adopted the Senate language amending 10 U.S.C. \u00a7664 for joint duty assignments and the House language amending the definition of \"joint matters\" under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7668. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) requires most males between 18 and 26 in the US to register with Selective Service for potential induction into the Armed Forces. Women are not required to register. Failure to register can result in criminal penalties. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) requires most males between 18 and 26 in the US to register for potential induction into the Armed Forces. Failure to register can lead to criminal penalties, loss of certain benefits, and denial of security clearances. Recent policy changes allowing women in all military roles have raised questions about the exemption for women from Selective Service registration. Recent DOD policy changes have opened all military roles to women, raising questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. There is debate over whether women should be required to register and if the Selective Service System is still necessary. The Senate bill proposed expanding registration requirements to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. The final bill requires DOD to conduct a detailed review of the Selective Service System. The final bill requires DOD to conduct a detailed review and report on the Selective Service System, questioning its necessity and exploring alternative mechanisms for emergency manpower needs.
