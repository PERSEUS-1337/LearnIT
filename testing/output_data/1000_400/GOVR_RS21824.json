Representative Souder highlighted the increasing number of drug and alcohol-related incidents on college campuses, calling it an epidemic. As a response, Congress added a provision to P.L. 105-244, eliminating financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug-related crimes. The provision in P.L. 105-244 eliminated financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug-related crimes. The legislation specifies that students convicted of selling or possessing controlled substances are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. Ineligibility duration depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple convictions. Students convicted of drug-related crimes may become ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The duration of ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple convictions. Ineligibility periods for possession or sale of controlled substances vary based on the offense number. The period of ineligibility for federal student assistance due to drug-related convictions varies based on the offense number. Possession of a controlled substance results in ineligibility for one year for the first offense, two years for the second offense, and indefinitely for the third offense. Sale of a controlled substance leads to ineligibility for two years for the first offense and indefinitely for the second offense. Convictions prior to turning 18 or that were overturned are not considered for eligibility determination. According to program regulations, a student's eligibility for federal financial assistance is not affected by convictions prior to turning 18 or convictions that were overturned. Indefinitely ineligible students must complete a drug rehabilitation program to regain eligibility, which must meet specific requirements outlined in the regulations. A rehabilitation program for drug offenses can reduce ineligibility for federal financial assistance. The program must be recognized by a government agency or licensed entity and include at least two unannounced drug tests. Participation in the program can shorten the ineligibility period based on the number of convictions. A rehabilitation program for drug offenses can reduce ineligibility for federal financial assistance by shortening the ineligibility period based on the number of convictions. Upon completion of the program, the student self-certifies completion. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision, representing fewer than .25% of all federal financial aid applicants. Since the adoption of the provision, over 180,000 students have been denied federal financial aid or faced delays. California and Texas have seen a high number of students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was enacted to address confusion and issues with the provision, specifying that only drug convictions during enrollment and aid receipt disqualify students. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision regarding drug convictions for students receiving federal aid, specifying that only convictions during enrollment disqualify students. The period of ineligibility still depends on the type and recency of the conviction. Legislative proposals are being considered to modify this provision in the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility for students receiving federal aid due to drug convictions depends on the type and recency of the conviction. Legislative proposals are being considered to modify this provision in the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the HEA, addressing issues such as implementation, penalties, and who should be penalized. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, the provision to disqualify students from financial aid due to drug convictions was added. Critics argue that singling out drugs for eligibility loss is unfair compared to other crimes like rape or arson. Supporters defend the provision citing the increasing drug-related crimes on college campuses. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, a provision was added to disqualify students from financial aid due to drug convictions. Critics argue that singling out drugs for eligibility loss is unfair compared to other crimes like rape or arson. Representative Frank contends that treating drug convictions more harshly than other crimes may be unjust. Supporters justify the focus on drug-related crimes by citing their prevalence on college campuses. The implications of limiting financial aid eligibility for drug-related crimes may be reconsidered during reauthorization. The existing provision does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony drug convictions. During reauthorization, the focus on drug-related crimes for financial aid eligibility may be debated by Congress. The provision does not distinguish between misdemeanor or felony drug convictions, resulting in loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Different ineligibility periods for selling versus possession of controlled substances acknowledge a distinction between users and sellers. Congress may discuss the impact of felony versus misdemeanor drug convictions on student aid eligibility."
