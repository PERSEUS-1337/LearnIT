Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, with the Water Resources Development Act being the main legislative tool for altering harbor maintenance policy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, with the Water Resources Development Act being the main legislative tool for altering harbor maintenance policy. Congress established current harbor maintenance policy in 1986, and decisions on harbor maintenance now have a greater impact on the U.S. economy due to the increase in merchandise trade. Harbor maintenance costs are supported by a harbor maintenance tax on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. The cost of harbor maintenance is funded by a harbor maintenance tax on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. The tax rate is 0.125% of cargo or cruise ticket value, generating revenue for the harbor maintenance trust fund used by the Corps of Engineers for dredging and maintenance. The fund can only be accessed with congressional approval. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is used by the Corps of Engineers for dredging and maintenance of harbors, funded by a tax on waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. The fund can only be accessed with congressional approval and has a balance of $8.5 billion as of July 2013. In FY2014, the HMTF is expected to receive $2.05 billion in income, with $923 million requested for harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has a balance of $8.5 billion as of July 2013. In FY2014, the Corps expects the HMTF to receive $2.05 billion in income, with $923 million requested for harbor maintenance. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to increase spending on harbor maintenance and ensure HMT revenues are used for maintenance rather than accumulating in the trust fund. H.R. 3080 aims to increase HMTF expenditures for harbor maintenance, ensuring that 80% of the HMT collected the prior fiscal year is spent on maintenance by FY2020. This could potentially reduce funding for other Corps activities, requiring Congress to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation to stay within federal budget caps. Congress established the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of harbors and inland harbors in the US. The fund is funded by the HMT and could impact funding for energy and water development appropriations, potentially requiring reallocation of funds to stay within federal budget caps. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by Congress in 1986 to cover maintenance costs for harbors and inland harbors in the US. The definitions of \"harbors\" and \"inland harbors\" include criteria related to handling commercial cargo, with inland harbors required to currently handle cargo. The definitions have remained unchanged since 1986, and the Corps did not conduct a rulemaking to implement the provisions. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with O&M costs payable from the HMTF. If a project is \"multi-purpose,\" only expenditures for commercial navigation are covered. According to the Corps, harbor projects are categorized as single-purpose or multi-purpose. Single-purpose projects have O&M costs covered by the HMTF, while multi-purpose projects only cover costs related to commercial navigation. High-use ports handle 90% of maritime commerce and receive two-thirds of HMTF spending. Operations and maintenance activities are scheduled for almost all high-use ports. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, account for 90% of maritime commerce and receive two-thirds of HMTF spending. Moderate-use ports, handling between 1-10 million tons, make up 9% of commerce and received 19% of spending. Low-use ports, handling 1% of commerce, received 5% of spending. This allocation of funds is a key point of debate in the HMTF discussion. The allocation of funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is a key point of debate. Low-use ports, which handle 1% of maritime commerce, received 5% of HMTF spending in FY2012. This disparity in funding allocation between low-use, moderate-use, and high-use ports is reflected in differences between S. 601 and H.R. 3080. The debate centers around whether funds should be allocated based on economic importance or commercial traffic volume. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) allocation is a point of contention. H.R. 3080 aims to distribute funds based on economic importance, while S. 601 leans towards funding large commercial ports. Data shows that many waterways eligible for HMTF spending have minimal or no commercial traffic. Almost 75% of eligible waterways for HMTF spending handled little to no cargo, with the majority of funds directed to high-use harbors based on cargo volume rather than value. This metric favors ports handling oil, chemical products, grains, ores, and coal. A value-based metric could result in a different allocation of funds. The volume-based metric for high-use harbors favors ports handling tankers, bulk ships, and container ships, potentially concentrating harbor maintenance funding. High-use ports received only about half of the requested O&M funds in FY2011. In 2012, major ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland handled 56% of U.S. maritime container shipments. High-use ports received only half of the O&M funds requested in FY2011, while moderate-use ports got 30% and low-use harbors received 10%. Despite low-use harbors requesting $766 million and busiest harbors requesting $922 million, small harbors only received one-tenth of their requested funds. This funding shortfall is concerning as economically significant ports received only half of their requested funds. The busiest harbors requested $922 million in funding, but economically significant ports only received half of their requested funds. The Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, leading to partial investments across many facilities. Harbor traffic is more concentrated when measured in terms of ship capacity. The Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, leading to partial investments across many facilities. Harbor traffic is more concentrated when measured in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. If national economic benefit were the principal criterion for spending, the Corps might concentrate funds on high-use harbors while reducing spending on low-use harbors, potentially hindering the development of moderate-use ports. The Corps may focus O&M funds on high-use harbors, potentially hindering moderate-use ports from developing. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 annually. Despite authorization for 1,400 projects, only 360 are actively maintained. The Corps performed maintenance work on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually from FY1999 to FY2008. A 2012 study revealed that out of over 1,400 authorized coastal navigation projects, only 360 are actively maintained. There is uncertainty about whether the Corps is maintaining fewer projects due to policy, funding, or maintenance needs. A 2003 study highlighted the lack of systematic evaluation for continued federal investment in harbor projects by the Corps. The Corps conducted maintenance work on hundreds of harbors and channels annually from FY1999 to FY2008. A 2003 study raised concerns about the lack of systematic evaluation for ongoing federal investment in harbor projects by the Corps, pointing out the need for explicit requirements and procedures to confirm the economic viability of these projects. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and ensuring their economic viability. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago, before modern transportation alternatives were available. This highlights the need for explicit requirements and procedures to reevaluate the economic viability of harbor projects when certain indicators fail minimum threshold tests. In the early 1900s, highways, railroads, pipelines, and airports provided alternatives to waterways for transportation. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining small harbors using funds from a cargo tax, with a focus on harbor maintenance projects of greatest commercial importance. The Corps has divested inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo, focusing on harbor maintenance projects of greatest commercial importance. They use a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" to prioritize funds based on commercial tonnage and ship transits. Recent budget guidance shows the Corps using metrics to group projects and allocating funds based on objective performance-based criteria. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using metrics like tonnage and ship transits. Budget guidance indicates funds are allocated using objective criteria such as cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements. The 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects and priorities, but no such committee has been established. A 2010 GAO report expressed concerns that the Corps' criteria for prioritizing projects are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment. The 2010 GAO report highlighted concerns about the Corps' project prioritization criteria and budget process, emphasizing the importance of actual project performance in determining budget priorities. No advisory committee has been established as recommended in the 2008 GAO report. The Corps assesses actual project performance over time to determine budget priorities, with a focus on opportunity cost for efficient fund distribution. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within national needs for optimal solutions. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, so an average over several years is a better indicator. However, the datasets on O&M expenses and waterway usage have not been jointly analyzed. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, so an average over several years is a better indicator. However, the data spanning several years on O&M expenses and waterway usage have not been jointly analyzed by the Corps, making it unavailable to Congress. The HMTF pays for maintaining federally designated channels, with a cost-sharing requirement for harbors deeper than 45 feet. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, only requiring local cost-sharing for channels deeper than 50 feet. The HMTF pays for maintaining federally designated channels, with a cost-sharing requirement for harbors deeper than 45 feet. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, only requiring local cost-sharing for channels deeper than 50 feet. Construction costs for deepening or widening channels are not funded through the HMTF but from general government revenues. The federal share of construction costs ranges from 40% to 80% depending on harbor depth. Construction costs for harbors vary based on depth, with a range of 40% to 80%. The general fund expenditures for construction at coastal harbors in FY2013 were $175 million. Some ports are unable to use HMTF money for dredging due to current laws. S. 601 would allow ports with excess HMT revenue to use funds for dredging or other purposes. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose allowing ports with excess Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) revenue to use funds for dredging berths and removing contaminated sediments. This could benefit deep ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, potentially reducing funds allocated to other ports. There is wide variation in HMT generated at harbors, with New York harbor generating about $132 million in 2011, approximately 15% of total HMT collections that year. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging berths and contaminated sediments under certain conditions. There is wide variation in HMT generated at harbors, with New York harbor generating about $132 million in 2011, approximately 15% of total HMT collections that year. The top 15 harbors collect more than 75% of total HMT revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft authorized by Congress. The Corps maintains harbors or channels for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. These harbors were authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950. The Corps prioritizes O&M funding for critical harbors of refuge, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries, even if they have little or no cargo activity. In FY2011 through FY2014, the Corps identified 30 different harbors as subsistence harbors or critical harbors of refuge to justify O&M funding. The Corps prioritizes O&M funding for critical harbors of refuge, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries. In FY2011 through FY2014, 30 different harbors were identified for O&M funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided an additional $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors in FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. The administration's criteria for navigation maintenance do not allow these types of harbors to compete for funds. The Appropriations Committees have allocated an extra $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors, urging the Corps to revise criteria for funding navigation projects. This includes considering economic impact on local economies, national defense, and public safety. Federal maintenance of recreational harbors has been a contentious issue in past administrations. The Clinton Administration proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors that did not contribute to the HMTF, totaling about $63 million in annual expenditures. President Reagan had also proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal support. The Clinton Administration proposed shifting responsibility for maintaining harbors to state and local governments, focusing the Corps on national water projects. President Reagan had suggested cutting funding for harbors with high maintenance costs, aiming to save $150 million annually. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) was established as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected a proposal for local port authorities to assess fees on ships for maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) was established as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected a proposal for local port authorities to assess fees on ships for maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little or no commercial cargo dates back to at least the 1950s, with the Corps' policy being not to maintain harbors not extensively used by commercial navigation. The government is not obligated to maintain waterways that are no longer economically viable. Minimum appropriations have prevented funds from being used on obsolete waterways, but a more thorough analysis is needed. A 1956 audit found that the Corps was maintaining waterways mainly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, prompting a recommendation for Congress to establish specific criteria for federal navigation projects. The audit identified 11 coastal projects of questionable value. In 2011, 11 coastal navigation projects received $12 million in O&M spending and generated $1.5 million in HMT revenues. Only two projects still carry cargo. The 155-mile Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended to be reclassified as a flood-control project due to negligible navigation benefit, but it continued to receive HMTF expenditures. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended to be reclassified as a flood-control project by the GAO due to minimal navigation benefits, but it continued to receive $30 million from the HMTF between FY1999 to FY2008. The Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas also received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008, despite no recent cargo movement. Recent budget requests have shifted O&M expenses towards flood risk mitigation over navigation, while recreational harbors have shown positive local economic impacts. Recreational boaters on the Great Lakes and in Oregon contribute significantly to the local economy, supporting thousands of jobs and spending billions annually. Despite not contributing to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), they do pay federal fuel taxes for various boating-related purposes. This funding mechanism dates back to a time when harbor dredging was funded differently before the enactment of a cargo tax in 1986. Recreational boaters do not contribute to the HMTF but pay federal fuel taxes for fish habitat restoration, boating safety programs, and marina facilities. Some in the industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for harbor dredging. A pilot program on the Atlantic Coast explores local financing feasibility. Key information on harbor maintenance spending is not publicly available, including current expenditure reports. The feasibility of greater local financing for harbor maintenance on low-commercial-use waterways along the Atlantic Coast is being investigated. However, key information needed to assess the need for increased spending, such as current expenditure reports and data comparing harbor usage with operation and maintenance expenses, is not publicly available. The Corps requests funds for yearly reports to Congress covering FY2005 and FY2006. Data on harbor usage and O&M expenses collected since 1922. Discrepancies in facility nomenclature and expenditure database. Lack of comparison on channel dimensions and economic impact of deficiencies. The Corps lacks comparison of shipping channel dimensions to authorized dimensions or modern vessel needs. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The program focuses on investing tax dollars wisely in navigation projects for long-term value. The NETS program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects rather than maintenance of existing harbors and channels. Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions from the annual budget starting in FY2014. The Corps was asked by Congress to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions from the annual budget starting in FY2014. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, with the HMT rate at 0.125%. Shipping a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000. The HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, with a rate of 0.125%. Shipping a container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000. Ports near Canada and Mexico claim that the HMT diverts cargo to those countries due to the lack of a similar tax. The HMT diverts inbound cargo to Canadian and Mexican borders, with factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influencing shippers' decisions. A study estimated that removing the HMT would redirect 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell are involved in the issue. The FMC concluded that removing the HMT would divert cargo from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation replacing the HMT with a user fee to reduce incentives for shipping through Canada. The HMT poses a significant obstacle to transshipment of sea cargo within the U.S. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) may discourage coastal feeder service and results in uncollected taxes from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) poses challenges for transshipment of containers at U.S. ports and results in uncollected taxes from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, impacting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay the HMT for port use when exporting a product, but they do pay the HMT on materials and inputs transported through ports for production of exported goods. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) can be refunded for exported goods to maintain price competitiveness of U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay HMT for port use when exporting, but do pay on materials used in production. The debate over WRDA is in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. House and Senate Committees express concern over insufficient budget requests for Corps O&M to ensure global competitiveness. U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have expressed concern over insufficient budget requests for Corps O&M to ensure global competitiveness. They have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to strategically improve the nation's marine transportation system and connecting infrastructure, aiming to enhance America's overall national freight infrastructure and competitiveness in the global marketplace. This initiative recognizes the impact of supply chain competitiveness on product costs, investments, and hiring decisions. The Department of Commerce emphasizes the importance of supply chain competitiveness in determining product costs, investments, and hiring decisions in the United States. A 2010 analysis highlights the significance of efficient supply chain management for corporate competitiveness. Policymakers, management leadership, and academicians need to align supply chain design and transportation infrastructure with strategic priorities. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to identify and capitalize on opportunities. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments and align with national priorities. President Obama initiated federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors and established a Task Force on Ports in his FY2013 Budget. President Obama initiated federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in 2012 to align with national priorities. He also established a Task Force on Ports in his FY2013 Budget to strategically allocate federal investments in response to calls from state and local governments, ports, and maritime stakeholders."
