    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as a significant source of environmental impact due to their construction, operation, and demolition. This impact includes resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and effects on human health. U.S. buildings consume vast amounts of resources annually, particularly in the form of electricity for lighting. Buildings, such as schools and hospitals, are a major component of the nation's infrastructure and have significant environmental impacts. They consume resources like electricity and water, produce waste, and account for 40% of energy consumption in the United States, leading to high environmental and financial costs. Buildings have significant environmental impacts due to their lifecycles, including construction, daily operations, and demolition. They account for 40% of energy consumption in the United States, leading to high costs and greenhouse gas emissions. The location of a building affects its ecological and human health impacts, such as stormwater management and transportation energy requirements. Proximity to public transportation can reduce the need for car commuting, decreasing traffic congestion and emissions. Occupant health and productivity are also influenced by building design and location. Green building addresses health and environmental impacts by reducing energy needed for transportation, improving indoor air quality, and mitigating pollutants that contribute to \"sick building syndrome.\" It transforms the design, construction, operation, and demolition of buildings to minimize negative effects on occupants and the environment. Green building is a tool for addressing environmental and health impacts in buildings, including \"sick building syndrome.\" It has gained significant interest since the 1990s and involves various stakeholders such as construction firms, building owners, lawmakers, and government agencies. This report discusses the concept of green building, federal policies, and associated issues. The report discusses green building, federal policies, and associated issues. It covers the definition of green building, environmental impacts addressed, tools for ensuring compliance, implementation challenges, statutory authorities, and federal agency programs related to green building. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the Committee on the Environment within the American Institute of Architects and the U.S. Green Building Council. The concept has since expanded to encompass environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts. The concept of green building emerged in the 1990s with organizations like the USGBC. Green building encompasses environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts. There is no single consensus definition, with efforts existing along a design and performance continuum. Some practices are considered \"greenwashing,\" while others aim to greatly reduce environmental impacts. Green building aims to reduce environmental impacts through integrated design, construction, and operations. It includes practices like \"zero-impact\" and \"minus-impact\" buildings, which strive for no net environmental impact or a net benefit. Most green building efforts have less ambitious reduction goals compared to these extreme examples. Green building is an integrated approach that significantly reduces the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. It is not limited to one factor like energy consumption but involves integration across several. Green builders aim to improve environmental performance through various techniques and strategies, applicable to any class of building. The green building approach involves integration across multiple factors and can be applied to any type of building. Builders aim to improve environmental performance through various techniques, from innovative technologies to design features influencing occupant behavior. Decisions on these techniques impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle, with a focus on new construction and a growing trend towards green renovation. Green building techniques are often decided during the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint. The term green building is used interchangeably with sustainable building and high-performance building, with a focus on new construction and a growing trend towards green renovation projects. Sustainable building aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. Sustainable building, green building, and high-performance building are terms often used interchangeably but have distinct goals. Sustainable building aims to maintain small environmental footprints indefinitely, while high-performance building includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions outline the integration and optimization of various attributes for high-performance buildings. High-performance buildings integrate and optimize energy efficiency, durability, occupant productivity, safety, security, accessibility, cost-benefit, sustainability, functionality, and operational considerations. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings. Additional objectives like aesthetics and historical preservation may also be considered in their design. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 refined the concept of high-performance green buildings by establishing a detailed definition. Descriptions of green building focus on elements such as energy, water, materials, waste, health, and siting. Siting has gained prominence in recent years, emphasizing the built environment beyond the building itself. Serviceability, productivity, and functionality are integral elements of any building design. The objectives for high-performance buildings include serviceability, productivity, and functionality, as well as disaster and climate resilience. These goals have become more important due to natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. Green building projects vary based on stakeholder needs and may prioritize different elements. The goals of green building projects vary based on stakeholder needs, influenced by local factors like climate zone and flood risk. A key element is reducing energy footprint through efficiency, conservation, and use of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal power. Energy storage technologies are also utilized. Energy efficiency and conservation, renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal power, energy storage technologies, and smart-grid innovations are crucial elements in green building projects due to economic costs and environmental impacts associated with energy use. Studies show significant potential energy savings in buildings compared to transportation and industry. Best available energy efficiency technologies could reduce building energy consumption by about half. The National Academies found that energy savings from energy efficiency measures in buildings are higher than in transportation and industry. Federal law mandates energy use reductions in federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. However, energy consumption in 2015 exceeded the federal goal. While energy is important in green building, focusing solely on energy may not make a building green. Water management in buildings is crucial for cost savings and resource conservation. Measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping can help reduce water usage. Additionally, managing rainwater, on-site water, and run-off is essential for sustainable development. Water management in buildings involves reducing water usage through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping. It also includes managing rainwater, on-site water, and run-off through techniques such as low-impact development and green infrastructure. The use of green infrastructure in buildings, such as porous materials and green roofs, can help manage water effectively. Additionally, choosing environmentally preferable materials with recycled content and low energy production can reduce the building's environmental footprint. Environmentally preferable materials, also known as \"green-labelled\" products, can reduce environmental impact by using recycled content, renewable resources, and low-energy production processes. These materials are designed to minimize health risks and pollutants. However, determining what qualifies as environmentally preferable can be challenging due to inconsistencies in vocabulary and measurement methodologies. Waste-reduction efforts in building construction can also help mitigate environmental impacts over the building's life cycle. The environmental impacts from a building's waste stream can be reduced through waste-reduction efforts such as source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Landscaping can also help by eliminating chemical pollutants and recycling waste. High-efficiency boilers and furnaces can reduce atmospheric pollutants, and operational solid waste can be recycled or processed to reduce their impact. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for occupant health, with factors like indoor air pollutants and ventilation playing a significant role. Maintaining high IAQ involves proper ventilation, air filtration, and using materials free of toxic substances. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) encompasses factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, in addition to IAQ. Site selection for buildings can impact environmental footprint, with considerations for proximity to transportation hubs and ecological sensitivity of potential sites. The siting of buildings near transportation hubs can reduce environmental impacts and promote the use of public transportation. Factors like building orientation, proximity to trees, and climate-related risks also influence a building's environmental footprint. Productivity is essential for a building to be valuable to its occupants, regardless of its environmental impact. Risks from sea-level rise, flooding, and extreme weather events, influenced by climate change, are a concern for builders in coastal areas. Productivity and utility are important aspects of green building, with studies showing that indoor environmental quality (IEQ) can impact worker comfort and productivity. Green buildings can improve productivity, but trade-offs between serviceability and other elements like acoustic performance may occur. The importance of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) on worker comfort and productivity in green buildings is highlighted. While green buildings can enhance productivity, trade-offs with serviceability, such as poor acoustic performance, may occur. Resilience to natural hazards like earthquakes and hurricanes is crucial for building longevity and functionality during service disruptions. Green certification systems emphasize resilience to natural hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, and forest fires to increase building longevity and functionality during service disruptions. Climate-resilient design, including resistant construction and on-site power generation, is crucial for withstanding severe weather events and climate change. Integration across elements is a key feature of green building design. The green building approach focuses on climate-resilient design, which involves assets prepared to withstand severe weather events and climate change. Integration across elements and stages is crucial for improving performance and minimizing environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and the development of an integrated strategy. Integration and performance across various elements in building design can be enhanced by using information technology. Focusing solely on energy efficiency without considering other factors can be counterproductive, as it may lead to issues such as poor air quality and moisture control problems. Balancing different goals and elements is essential for a successful and sustainable building design. A green building approach considers energy efficiency, health, and overall optimization. It may require compromises or technologies like active ventilation with heat exchange. Prioritizing elements based on cost, feasibility, and occupant priorities is crucial. In some cases, only one or a few factors can be addressed, while in others, certain elements may be prioritized over others. In green building approaches, prioritizing elements based on cost, feasibility, and occupant priorities is crucial for overall optimization. Choices made during construction can impact the environmental sustainability of a building, such as the use of concrete walls for insulation versus wood, which has higher carbon dioxide emissions over its life cycle. It is important to consider the environmental impacts of developing, manufacturing, installing, using, and disposing of building materials to make environmentally sound choices. In green building approaches, prioritizing elements based on cost, feasibility, and occupant priorities is crucial for overall optimization. Choices made during construction can impact the environmental sustainability of a building. Use of concrete walls provides more insulation than wood but has higher carbon dioxide emissions. Energy use during building operation should be balanced with construction choices. A green building approach can assess the impact of actions on all stages. On-site renewable energy and stormwater management can enhance building resilience. Formal systems and tools have been developed to set criteria for green and sustainable buildings, falling into rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Determining whether a building is green or sustainable is complex due to the interconnections of elements involved. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points to buildings for meeting criteria, with some systems like LEED combining both rating and certification. The term rating system is often used interchangeably with certification system in green building practices. Systems like LEED combine both rating and certification into a single system, assigning points to buildings for meeting criteria in various design categories. Certification validates that a building meets specified requirements, with objectivity ensured by an independent third party. Certification validates that a building meets or exceeds specified design or performance requirements. An independent third party must conduct the assessment for objectivity. LEED, developed by the USGBC, is the most prevalent certification system in the US, serving as a benchmark for green building design. Over 37,300 commercial buildings have been LEED certified as of April 2017. LEED, launched in 1998 by USGBC, is a widely recognized green building certification system. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been LEED certified as of April 2017. Certification categories include new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. LEED focuses on six green building elements. LEED certification is available for various types of buildings, with a focus on six green building elements. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a certain number of points to achieve certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The certification process includes a five-year recertification cycle and considers factors like innovation and regional priorities. LEED certification requires meeting mandatory requirements and earning points for certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The checklist approach allows for simple compliance assessment and integrated consideration of green building elements. Other certification systems include BREEAM, a British system developed in 1990. The BREEAM In-Use certification system, introduced in the United States in 2017, is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance. Unlike LEED, BREEAM In-Use has no prerequisites and allows any existing building to benchmark performance and certify improvements. BREEAM ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding, based on a building's score across nine impact categories. The BREEAM In-Use certification system allows any existing building to benchmark performance and certify improvements. Ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding based on nine impact categories. Green Globes, based on BREEAM, offers one to four Globes based on points earned out of 1000 across six elements. The Green Globes certification system awards between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements: site, energy, water, materials and resources, emissions, and indoor environment. Unlike BREEAM In-Use, Green Globes does not have mandatory provisions or prerequisites for certification. The Living Building Challenge by the International Living Future Institute offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification, with criteria falling into seven performance areas known as \"Petals\". The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Criteria for certification fall into seven performance areas known as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven areas, Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three Petals including water, energy, or materials, and Zero Energy Certification requires generating all energy needs on site without combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge also includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different ratings systems emphasize various aspects of green building. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Certification under the Living Building Challenge requires a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different green building ratings systems emphasize various aspects and may be more appropriate depending on local conditions and priorities. Some programs certify specific elements like energy efficiency (Energy Star), indoor air quality (Indoor airPLUS), and water conservation (WaterSense). Several additional green building certification programs exist for single elements or limited performance areas, including Energy Star (energy-efficiency), Indoor airPLUS (indoor air quality), WaterSense (water efficiency), Zero Energy Ready Home (energy and air quality), and Passive House/ PHIUS+ (energy, water, and air quality). Federal statutes and policies mandate green building requirements for federal offices and agencies, with the General Services Administration (GSA) recommending the use of third-party certification systems since the late 1990s. The General Services Administration (GSA) has recommended the use of third-party green building certification systems for federal offices and agencies since the late 1990s. Some agencies have found benefits in using these systems, such as simplifying compliance with federal guidelines, reducing the need for additional staff, and providing a recognizable label for sustainability efforts. Several agencies have established internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA required collaboration between the Secretary of Energy, GSA, and the Department of Defense (DOD) to identify a third-party certification system. The GSA recommended the use of third-party green building certification systems for federal offices and agencies to simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. Agencies have established internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA required collaboration to identify a third-party certification system, with GSA recommending the use of either LEED or Green Globes for federal agencies. The Secretary's recommendation is to review and update every five years, considering a study by the Director of GSA's Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings. GSA suggested federal agencies use LEED or Green Globes for new construction projects, with specific rating requirements. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for green building certification systems used by federal agencies. Many states also mandate green building certification for government buildings. The Department of Energy rulemaking establishes minimum criteria for green building certification systems used by federal agencies. States and local jurisdictions also require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering incentives. Green building rating systems have influenced model building codes and standards, which may be incorporated into mandatory codes or laws. Building codes are mandatory requirements for building design and construction, focusing on health, safety, aesthetics, and resource use. Green building codes and standards address multiple elements, excluding energy efficiency. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 set a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes. Green building codes go beyond minimum requirements for building design and construction, focusing on environmental design and performance. State and local governments adopt national model codes for regulating buildings, with some jurisdictions adding additional requirements known as \"beyond-code\" options. Green building codes, also known as \"beyond-code\" options, exceed minimum building code requirements and focus on environmental design and performance. Governments can choose to make these codes mandatory or voluntary for meeting green building objectives. Technical standards for specific components are often incorporated into model and mandatory building codes, created by recognized standards development organizations. Building codes often include technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations (SDOs). Some organizations have used the standards-development process to establish green building standards. These standards define guidelines and criteria for judging products. Buildings can be certified under a rating system or for meeting specific standards. Green building requirements can be achieved through prescriptive, performance, or outcome-based pathways, offering flexibility in design methods. Building codes and standards offer multiple pathways for achieving requirements, including prescriptive and performance pathways. Outcome-based requirements set performance targets that must be verified after construction. Green building standards can be code-intended and adopted by jurisdictions. Standards are developed through a consensus process and accredited by organizations like ANSI. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC is responsible for the widely used International Building Code (IBC) and released the International Green Building Code in 2012. These codes are written in mandatory, code-enforceable language and may be adopted by jurisdictions with modifications. ANSI standards require accreditation and third-party certification for development processes. The International Code Council (ICC) is responsible for developing comprehensive International Codes, including the widely used International Building Code (IBC) in the United States. In 2012, the ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC), which includes sustainability measures for construction projects. The IgCC can be adopted alongside other ICC codes and offers various compliance pathways for municipalities. The IgCC, released in 2015, is fully compatible with the ICC codes for building safety. Municipalities can adopt the IgCC as an overlay with different compliance options. It covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The NGBS, developed with ASHRAE and NAHB, is a rating system like LEED and can be adopted by ordinance. The NGBS, developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB, is a green building standard structured as a rating system. ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have also released Standard 189.1 for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, covering site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Elements of Standard 189.1 have been incorporated into Department of Defense properties. The IgCC standard includes requirements for site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Standard 189.1 elements are integrated into Department of Defense properties. ICC and ASHRAE partnered to incorporate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 IgCC version aligned with the LEED rating system. Various state, local, and tribal authorities have their own green building codes, and federal laws also have provisions related to green building. Several federal laws, executive orders, and policy instruments have provisions related to green building, such as the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) which included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in buildings. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) mandates agencies to procure products with recycled content. State and local policies also play a significant role in green building efforts within their jurisdictions.

Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance by affecting construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The costs of implementing green building measures strongly influence design and construction decisions. Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance by affecting initial construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The actual and perceived costs of implementing green building measures can influence design and construction decisions, but obtaining accurate cost information can be challenging. Researchers note that the flexibility in designing green buildings makes it difficult to generalize about their cost performance as a whole. Limited empirical evidence exists on the financial performance of green building investments, with a common belief that initial costs are higher than for conventional buildings. Designing individual green buildings makes generalizing about the cost performance of the market segment difficult. Empirical evidence on the financial performance of green building investments is limited. Initial costs of green buildings are believed to be higher than conventional buildings, with higher perceived costs being a top obstacle in the United States. Higher costs can stem from various sources, such as expensive features and design costs. However, there is some evidence that constructing green buildings may not be substantially more expensive than standard construction. The costs of constructing green buildings, including expenses for appliances and high-performance windows, may be higher initially, but evidence suggests that they are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design can lead to cost reductions, and operational savings over time can offset the initial investment. Green buildings can save on utility resources and even generate renewable energy for additional savings. Green buildings can result in initial cost reductions, with evidence supporting operational cost savings over time. They can reduce utility resource usage and even sell renewable energy back to the grid. Studies show that green certification is linked to lower utility expenses, but it only makes up a small portion of a building's operating costs. There is mixed evidence on whether green certification reduces overall operating expenses, but green-labeled buildings may command price premiums. Some evidence suggests that green certification is associated with reduced utility expenses, but it only accounts for a small portion of a building's operating costs. Green-labeled buildings may command price premiums in the real estate market, but there are factors that can reduce incentives for investments in green building, especially for building owners who may move frequently or rent out the property. Investments in green building can face challenges, especially for building owners who may move frequently or rent out the property. The financial return on such investments depends on factors like tenant tenure and availability of capital. Constraints on capital availability can limit green building renovations in various sectors, including educational institutions and hospitals. Investments in green building may face challenges due to constraints on capital availability, especially for building owners who move frequently or rent out the property. Cost barriers are reported in sectors like educational institutions and hospitals. Financial incentives from states and municipalities can help offset higher initial costs, making green building investments more financially attractive. The concept of the \"triple bottom line\" is used to consider costs beyond monetary expenditures in green building literature. Incentives from states and municipalities can offset higher initial costs, making green building investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept includes social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones. Green building efforts need to distinguish between design and performance, with a focus on operational factors that can affect building performance. The focus of green building has been on design and construction specifications, but actual environmental performance is not always incorporated into certification requirements. Factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use can affect a green building's performance post-certification. It is uncertain if a nominally green building will perform significantly better or worse than a conventional one. Some certified green buildings have been shown to be resource-intensive post-occupancy. Studies have shown that the performance of green buildings is not always significantly better than conventional buildings. Even with greater resource-use efficiency, savings may be offset by other factors such as larger size and increased energy consumption in newer homes. The energy performance of green buildings has been closely scrutinized. The energy performance of green buildings has been closely scrutinized, with a significant difference often found between predicted and actual energy use, known as a \"performance gap.\" Closing this gap is a key concern for the construction industry, leading to increased emphasis on postoccupancy performance assessment in rating systems like LEED. The construction industry is concerned about the performance gap in green buildings. Rating systems like LEED are now emphasizing postoccupancy performance assessment by requiring building-level energy and water meters for the first five years after certification. Other systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification, include performance parameters in their criteria. Building codes are also moving towards incorporating performance outcomes, like the 2015 IgCC which allows builders to meet requirements through actual performance. Building codes are evolving to include performance parameters for certification, such as the 2015 IgCC which allows builders to meet requirements through actual performance. Commissioning building systems ensures they are designed, installed, and operated as planned, improving environmental performance. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards for certification. The process of improving environmental performance in buildings can be achieved through certification, commissioning, and implementing an environmental management system (EMS) with performance measurement. Building monitoring tools aid in early fault detection and resource use analytics for effective management. Building monitoring tools, such as GSAlink, can detect equipment faults and provide resource use analytics for effective building management. However, challenges exist in measuring and evaluating green building performance due to a lack of consensus on criteria and outcomes. Recent studies have shown that green buildings exhibit a wide range of energy performance, with some performing below expectations. LEED ratings are primarily used as criteria for inclusion in these studies, as other rating systems are less prevalent in the U.S. market. The studies primarily use LEED ratings for inclusion due to their prevalence in the U.S. market. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings showed they performed 24% better on average, with some performing worse. Criticisms included sample bias and inappropriate baselines. Follow-up research found no energy savings for lower certifications but 13% better for Gold and Platinum. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, mostly LEED-certified, showed better performance than the national average. A follow-up assessment using the same data found that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which were LEED-certified, showed better performance than the national average in various areas. However, a study of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings revealed that 9 of them did not meet the federal energy consumption requirement at the time of the study. The study of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings found that 9 did not meet federal energy consumption requirements, consuming more electricity than the national average. Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings also underperformed in energy use simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies and results. These findings suggest that LEED certification may not consistently reduce building energy consumption, but small sample sizes limit generalizability. The findings from studies on LEED certification do not consistently show reduced building energy consumption. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive assessments. Improved access to building performance data is crucial for evaluating environmental targets and enhancing green building performance measurement methods. Performance measurement is crucial for ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and identifying areas for improvement. Methods for measuring green building performance are not well-developed for most elements, with some being easier to quantify than others. Disagreements may arise on which metrics are most relevant, such as energy use intensity (EUI). Performance measurement is essential for evaluating green building performance, with disagreements on relevant metrics like energy use intensity (EUI). The Green Building Advisory Committee proposed new methodologies for measuring EUI, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI for commuter transportation. However, accurate building occupancy data is crucial for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. The Advisory Committee emphasizes the importance of accurate building occupancy data for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI and notes discrepancies in energy use patterns based on different metrics. It is suggested that commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not accurately measure outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are crucial for maintaining environmental performance over the building's lifespan. Eventually, a standard life-cycle assessment for whole buildings may be feasible. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance. The importance of measuring building performance over time is emphasized, especially in relation to energy use. Federal agencies are required to measure their buildings' performance against specified targets, with more stringent requirements for new construction. Challenges exist in accurately determining baseline energy consumption levels. Despite available resources for measurement, uncertainties and gaps make effective application challenging. In 2008, the National Science and Technology Council identified the need for accurate measurement science as crucial for progress in green building. Developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability is a priority for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies widely. The Technology Council highlighted the importance of measurement science for advancing green building. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies, with the Obama Administration releasing annual sustainability and energy scorecards for each agency. Scorecards track progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. The Technology Council emphasized the importance of measurement science for advancing green building, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology focusing on developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Federal agencies track progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings through annual sustainability and energy scorecards. Scorecards include numeric reports and color scores indicating progress towards targets. Federal progress toward green building and energy intensity goals is discussed. Some agencies have surpassed the 15% compliance target for green buildings, while others are making progress. Many agencies did not meet the 30% energy intensity reduction goal by 2015. Several agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings, while others have received a red score in the green buildings category from OMB for FY2015. The government-wide energy intensity goal was to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015, but only a 22% decline was achieved. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015, with progress starting to be reported from FY2016. The potable water intensity goal was initially set for a 26% reduction by 2020, but was replaced in 2015 with a 36% reduction by 2025. Many agencies have already achieved the earlier goal from E.O. 13514. Water Intensity Goal: E.O. 13514 aimed for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity by 2020, replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015 with a 36% reduction by 2025. Agencies have made progress towards both goals, but concerns exist about green building certification systems lacking performance caps. Critics have raised concerns about green building certification systems lacking performance caps and not being sufficiently integrative or sustainable. Some argue for new approaches focusing on maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem services beyond individual buildings. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base for green building poses challenges in identifying appropriate approaches. Substantial research is needed to improve understanding of all elements of green building. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base for green building poses challenges in identifying appropriate approaches. Substantial research is needed to improve understanding of all elements of green building, including objective criteria and approaches. Differences in goals and perspectives among proponents can complicate the process. Congress may face questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs and coordination methods. Congress may face questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs and coordination methods, as well as how to extend efforts to support adoption of green building measures. Prioritizing different elements of green building, especially siting, which has received less attention, and facilitating scientific and technical knowledge growth are key considerations for Congress. Additional actions could be taken through appropriations or new statutory measures. Congress may need to prioritize different elements of green building, such as siting, and facilitate scientific and technical knowledge growth. Actions could include appropriations, new statutory requirements, and reviewing agency programs. GAO reports have highlighted federal efforts in green building, but coordination among agencies is recommended for a more integrative approach. One report identified 94 initiatives across 11 agencies related to green building in the nonfederal sector, focusing on specific elements like energy, IEQ, or water. GAO recommended agencies coordinate to assess initiative performance. Congress should examine federal agencies' implementation of green building programs and their impact on nationwide adoption. Coordination of agency efforts should also be evaluated. The federal government is urged to assess the impact of green building programs on nationwide adoption. Congress could consider providing stronger incentives, expanding mortgage and tax incentives, funding rebate programs, and specific appropriations to accelerate green building adoption in underperforming markets. Congress could consider providing stronger incentives, expanding mortgage and tax incentives, funding rebate programs, and specific appropriations to accelerate green building adoption in underperforming markets. Additionally, Congress could explore regulatory actions and ways to enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies. Congress could consider enhancing current green building efforts in federal agencies, ensuring integration and harmonization across agencies. Energy efficiency is a key focus due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and inefficient energy use in buildings. The priority of green building efforts in federal agencies is crucial due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, strategic vulnerability, and climate change. Congress should assess the balance of federal efforts in green building and consider strengthening existing programs or establishing new ones. Additionally, they should explore if the incremental approach to green building is sufficient or if modifications are needed. Funding for scientific and technological knowledge in green building is supported by both federal and private-sector sources, but may be suboptimal to address national needs. The development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building is funded by federal and private-sector sources, but funding levels may be insufficient. Studies have shown that green building receives minimal funding compared to other sectors, with some elements like energy receiving higher priority. More investment in R&D for green building elements is needed to address national needs. The funding for R&D in green building sectors is lower than the industry average, with varying priorities for different elements. Congress may need to reconsider federal funding levels and priorities, create incentives for private-sector R&D, and ensure sufficient training for a knowledgeable workforce in green building efforts. Congress may need to reconsider federal funding levels and priorities, create incentives for private-sector R&D, and ensure sufficient training for a knowledgeable workforce in green building efforts, including federal green buildings, schools, and hospitals."
