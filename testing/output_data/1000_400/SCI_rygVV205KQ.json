Adversarial imitation is shown to be effective in learning a representation of the world from pixels and exploring efficiently with rare reward signals. The adversary, acting as the reward function, can be small with just 128 parameters and trained using a basic GAN formulation. This approach overcomes limitations of other imitation methods, requiring only video demonstrations and sparse rewards to solve complex tasks like robot manipulation. Our approach overcomes limitations in contemporary imitation methods by requiring only video demonstrations and sparse rewards to solve complex tasks like robot manipulation. The proposed agent learns faster than competing approaches and can even learn stacking without any task reward purely from imitation. The new adversarial goal recognizer allows the agent to learn stacking without task rewards purely from imitation. Optimizing deep adversarial networks is challenging, but progress is being made. GAIL can handle high-dimensional pixel observations with a single-layer discriminator network and improve efficiency with a D4PG agent using a replay buffer. Different features can be successfully used with a small adversary in cases where a deep adversary is not needed. The use of a Deep Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) agent with a replay buffer improves efficiency in environment interactions. Various types of features, including self-supervised embeddings and value network features, can be successfully utilized with a small adversary. The modified GAIL for off-policy D4PG agents with experience replay shows promising results in solving a challenging robotic block stacking task from pixels using only demonstrations and sparse binary rewards. In experiments, a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent successfully learns block stacking from demonstration videos and sparse rewards, achieving a 94% success rate on a simulated Jaco arm. This approach reduces the dependency on hand-crafted rewards and learns to stack faster than agents using dense staged rewards. The paper introduces a 6-DoF Jaco robot arm agent that learns block stacking from demonstration videos and sparse rewards, achieving a 94% success rate on a simulated Jaco arm. It also presents an adversary-based early termination method for actor processes and an agent that learns with no task reward using an auxiliary goal recognizer adversary, achieving 55% stacking success from video imitation only. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking and a 2D planar walker benchmark are conducted to understand the reasons for improvement in the agent.

DDPG is an actor-critic method where the actor and critic are neural networks trained to maximize expected rewards. Transitions are added to a replay buffer for training the action-value function.

DDPG is an actor-critic method where transitions are added to a replay buffer for training the action-value function. Q(s, a|\u03b8) and \u03c0(s|\u03c6) are neural networks with parameters \u03c6 and \u03b8, respectively. The action-value function is trained to match 1-step returns by minimizing where the transition is sampled from the replay buffer B, and target actor and critic networks are updated every K learning steps for stability. The policy network is trained via gradient descent to produce actions that maximize the action-value function using the deterministic policy gradient. Additional improvements are made in the D4PG agent. The network is trained via gradient descent to maximize the action-value function using the deterministic policy gradient. Building on the DDPG agent, improvements are made in the D4PG agent. In GAIL, a reward function is learned by training a discriminator network to distinguish between agent and expert transitions. GAIL is related to MaxEnt inverse reinforcement learning. The D4PG agent does off-policy training with experience replay. The actor and critic updates are the same as in D4PG, but the reward function is jointly trained using a modified equation. The D4PG agent does off-policy training with experience replay using a modified equation for training the reward function. The reward function interpolates imitation reward and a sparse task reward, without using actions in the discriminator. The D4PG agent uses importance sampling for off-policy training with experience replay. The reward function combines imitation reward and sparse task reward, without involving actions in the discriminator. Multiple CPU actor processes run in parallel with a single GPU learner process. The D4PG agent uses importance sampling for off-policy training with experience replay. It includes pseudocode for actor and learner processes, with multiple CPU actors and a single GPU learner. Early termination of episodes occurs when the discriminator score is below a threshold to prevent drifting from expert trajectories. The type of network used in the discriminator is critical for the reward function. The D4PG agent uses importance sampling for off-policy training with experience replay. Early termination of episodes prevents drifting from expert trajectories. The type of network in the discriminator is crucial for the reward function, with different architectures studied. Expert demonstrations provide valuable data for feature learning. The discriminator architecture is crucial for the reward function in the D4PG agent, with different architectures studied. Expert demonstrations are valuable for feature learning as they cover regions of the state space needed to solve the task. Access to expert actions is not assumed, ruling out behavior cloning for feature learning. Learning features by predicting in pixel space is not chosen due to high-resolution images and the need to learn long-term structure for imitation learning. Based on the need to learn long-term structure for imitation learning and the high resolution of images, the decision was made not to learn features by predicting in pixel space. Instead, contrastive predictive coding (CPC) was chosen as a representation learning technique, utilizing a probabilistic contrastive loss with negative sampling to train the encoder and autoregressive model jointly without the need for a decoder model at the observation level. CPC uses probabilistic contrastive loss with negative sampling for long-term predictions in latent space. Task rewards can be replaced with a neural network goal recognizer, but frozen networks may lead to blind spots and imitation rewards without solving the task. To address the issue of frozen neural networks leading to blind spots and imitation rewards, a secondary goal discriminator network can be used to detect if an agent has reached a goal state. This modified reward function replaces sparse task rewards and defines a goal state as a state in the latter 1/M proportion of expert demonstrations, with M set to 3. The secondary goal discriminator network, D goal, operates on the same feature space as the primary discriminator, D, but does not share weights. Training D goal involves sampling expert states only from the latter 1/M of the demonstrations. The modified reward function in the expert demonstration involves using a secondary goal discriminator network, D goal, which operates on the same feature space as the primary discriminator, D. By training this second discriminator to recognize goal states, the agent can surpass the demonstrator by learning to reach the goal faster. Visualizations of the environments are provided in FIG2, including a Kinova Jaco arm and two blocks on a tabletop. The agent can surpass the demonstrator by learning to reach the goal faster using a second discriminator. The environment includes a Kinova Jaco arm with 9 degrees of freedom and hand-crafted reward functions. Demonstrations are collected using a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller with a human operator controlling the arm. The hand-crafted reward functions are used to collect demonstrations with a SpaceNavigator 3D motion controller. 500 episodes of demonstration for each task were gathered, along with 500 validation trajectories and 30 \"non-expert\" trajectories for CPC diagnostics. Another environment involves a 2D walker from the DeepMind control suite, where D4PG agent was trained from proprioceptive states to match a target velocity using 64x64 pixel observations of 200 expert demonstrations. The curr_chunk discusses comparing an imitation method to D4PG and GAIL agents using expert demonstrations and hyperparameter settings. The proposed method shows favorable results in visualizations of future frame predictions. The proposed method using a tiny adversary compares favorably in visualizing future frame predictions. It shows that conditioning on k-step predictions improves performance on stacking tasks. Additionally, the imitation methods learn quickly with superior performance despite only utilizing sparse rewards. In figure 4, D4PG struggles with sparse rewards and slow learning pace, while imitation methods excel despite sparse rewards. Value network features lead to quicker takeoff than CPC features, reaching comparable performance. GAIL from pixels performs poorly, but GAIL with tiny adversaries on random projections has limited success. GAIL value features may benefit from norm clipping in the critic optimizer. The discriminator network has limited success with CPC features of dimension 128, while the value network features are 2048-dimensional. Norm clipping in the critic optimizer may explain why GAIL value features work while pixel features do not. Introducing norm clipping in the agent \"GAIL -pixels + clip\" did not improve performance in Jaco or Walker2D environments. Using temporal predictions from CPC for future expert states did not yield success either. In addition to using CPC features as input to the discriminator, one can query CPC about future expert states. Ablation experiments on Jaco stacking show that adding layers to the discriminator network does not improve performance, and early termination is detrimental. Even with fewer demonstrations, the agent can learn stacking as effectively as with more demonstrations. Learning a discriminator directly on pixels resulted in poor performance in previous experiments. Termination hurts performance in imitation learning experiments. A small discriminator is shown to be more effective than a deeper network. Early termination criterion improves learning speed by stopping episodes with low discriminator scores. In imitation learning experiments, a small discriminator is more effective than a deeper network. An early termination criterion improves learning speed by stopping episodes with low discriminator scores. The model learns slower without early stopping, and episode length decreases as the agent improves at imitating the expert. Data efficiency is evaluated in a third ablation experiment. In a third ablation experiment, the data efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of expert demonstrations. Results show that even with 60 demonstrations, good performance is achieved. The performance on the planar walker is visualized, showing that the proposed method using value network features and random projections learn to run, unlike conventional GAIL methods. Videos of the trained agent are included. The result with 120 demos is considered an outlier due to a random seed issue. Our proposed method using value network features and random projections successfully learned to run, unlike conventional GAIL methods. Videos of the trained agent are available in the supplementary materials. Agents trained without rewards achieved a 55% success rate, with two out of five runs showing successful learning without task rewards. The agent achieved a 55% success rate without task rewards, learning to stack efficiently and exploit expert demonstrations. Leveraging expert demonstrations to improve agent performance has a long history in robotics. In robotics, leveraging expert demonstrations to enhance agent performance has a long history. Recent work shows that priming a Q-function on expert demonstrations can improve agent performance in tasks like cart-pole swing up. However, our task differs as we only have access to pixel observations, not states and actions. Deep learning has been successful in tasks beyond computer vision, including interacting with environments. Imitation learning is attractive as it resembles classification and regression problems where deep networks excel. Imitation learning in robotics aims to extend deep learning success to interacting with environments. Supervised imitation and one-shot imitation approaches are used to replicate behaviors from single demonstrations. Different methods, such as attention mechanisms and gradient-based meta learning, are employed to achieve one-shot learning. Our approach differs from previous methods by focusing on the agent learning through interaction with the environment rather than supervised learning. Behavioral cloning can lead to failures when the agent encounters states not seen during training, requiring many demonstrations and limiting generalization. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and deep Q-Learning from demonstration (DQfD) are proposed as alternatives to behavior cloning for training agents. IRL learns a reward function from demonstrations, while DQfD incorporates expert trajectories into experience replay for agent training. These methods aim to improve generalization and performance in reinforcement learning tasks. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and deep Q-Learning from demonstration (DQfD) are methods that optimize learned rewards from expert trajectories to train agents. BID26 and BID36 further enhance these techniques for better performance in sparse-exploration Atari games and real-world tasks like peg insertion on robots. GAIL applies adversarial learning to imitation problems, inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in image generation. GAIL applies adversarial learning to imitation problems, aiming to solve sparse reward tasks with high-dimensional input spaces by using minimal adversaries on top of learned features. In contrast to GAIL's approach of using minimal adversaries for solving sparse reward tasks, BID30 and BID3 focus on learning compact representations for imitation learning from expert observations. They utilize self-supervised features from third person observations to bridge the domain gap between different perspectives. While GAIL tracks a single expert trajectory, BID30 and BID3 aim to generalize all possible initializations of a hard exploration task by using static self-supervised features like contrastive predictive coding and dynamic value network features. The curr_chunk discusses training block stacking agents using expert trajectories through GAIL, utilizing self-supervised features and dynamic value network features. It also mentions supplementary videos of the learned agents and compares the performance with a behavior cloning model. The curr_chunk discusses the behavior cloning model's architecture and stacking accuracy, as well as the visualization of CPC on video data. It explains the encoder and autoregressive model components optimizing the same loss function with negative samples. The curr_chunk discusses the contrastive predictive coding (CPC) model, which optimizes mutual information between context and target vectors to extract common features. The weights for predicting future latent steps are learned, enhancing the model's ability to capture slow features. The curr_chunk discusses the application of the proposed approach, which involves training an agent using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) future predictions. Reward functions are defined for evaluation, including dense staged rewards and sparse rewards for specific tasks. The curr_chunk outlines the reward system for a task involving stacking colored blocks. Actor and critic networks share a residual network with convolutional layers and fully connected layers. Distributional Q functions are used instead of a scalar state-action value function. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Distributional Q functions with a categorical representation of Z for computing bootstrap targets with N-step returns in a task involving stacking colored blocks. The curr_chunk explains the calculation of bootstrap targets using Distributional Q functions with N-step returns in a task involving stacking colored blocks. It involves fixed atoms bounded between V min and V max, constructing a bootstrap target Z, adopting categorical projection \u03a6, and using distributed prioritized experience replay for stability and learning efficiency."
