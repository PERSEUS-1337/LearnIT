The state board in California mandates the adoption of instructional materials for various subjects, including language arts, mathematics, science, social science, and other disciplines as deemed necessary. Procedures are established for the submission of these materials, with limitations on resubmission if no substantive changes are made. If a publisher or manufacturer submits revisions to instructional material after the specified timeframe, the department will assess a fee not exceeding the costs for review. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months, with a possible extension of three months for complex materials or unforeseen circumstances. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer content experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. The adoption rules are transparent and applicable to all formats of materials. The state board uses specific criteria to ensure submitted materials meet standards.

The state board adopts instructional materials based on a new or revised curriculum framework. Lists of adopted instructional materials are categorized by subject and grade level, accessible to school districts, and posted on the department's website. The lists include information from review committees and may include publisher details for basic information, copyright protection, or third-party content identification. The state board may adopt regulations for exceptions, and the Superintendent will develop guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code defines followup adoptions and requires notice before conducting them in a subject area. Before conducting a followup adoption in a subject area, the department must post a notice on their website and notify publishers. Publishers participating will be assessed a fee based on the number of programs and grade levels submitted for review. The fee will cover the cost of the followup adoption process, with efforts made to keep it modest and avoid duplicating work from the primary adoption. Before incurring substantial costs for the followup adoption, the department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit specific programs for review, specifying grade levels. A fee is assessed, payable even if programs are withdrawn or grade levels reduced. Submission will not be reviewed until the fee is paid in full. The Legislature intends for the fee for follow-up adoption to not be prohibitive for small publishers or manufacturers. Small publishers or manufacturers can request a fee reduction. Small publishers and manufacturers are defined as independently owned businesses with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less. Revenue from fees will be used for adoption and instructional material review costs. The revenue from fees charged for follow-up adoption will be used for adoption and instructional material review costs. If there is little interest from publishers and manufacturers, a follow-up adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, unless extended or repealed by a later statute."
