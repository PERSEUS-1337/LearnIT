    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that millions of Americans ride bicycles regularly, leading to numerous head injuries and deaths. A significant portion of these incidents involve children under 15, costing society billions annually. Universal helmet use could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries. Universal use of bicycle helmets in the United States could have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries from head injuries annually, costing society $7.6 billion. Only 5 percent of children who ride bicycles wear helmets, despite the fact that a child with a head injury can cost society $4.5 million over their lifetime. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants can be used to enforce laws on bicycle helmet use, assist in acquiring helmets, educate on helmet importance for safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after this Act must conform to interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, until a final standard is established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days of the Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmet safety within 60 days of the Act, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and addressing injury risks to children. The final standard for bicycle helmet safety will include provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and address injury risks to children. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply to this proceeding, and the final standard will take effect one year after issuance. Failure to meet interim standards will be considered a violation of consumer product safety standards until the final standard is in effect. The final standard for bicycle helmet safety, once in effect, will deem non-conforming helmets as violating consumer product safety standards. The final standard developed under subsection (c) will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final safety standards."
