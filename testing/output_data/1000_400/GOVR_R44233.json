Jordan's $275.1 million compact aims to increase water supply in Amman and Zarqa, as well as improve water delivery and wastewater treatment. Critics have raised concerns about MCC aid going to countries with poor democratic indicators. Critics argue that countries with low democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid. Freedom House suggested bypassing countries with low scores on political rights and civil liberties, like Jordan. Development analysts also believe Jordan should not be eligible due to its existing U.S. aid, access to private sector capital, and lack of democracy. The debate on the costs and benefits of MCC aid has been ongoing for nearly fifteen years. The debate on funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing for nearly fifteen years, with the 9/11 attacks leading to a reorientation of U.S. policy towards authoritarianism and terrorism.

However, Congress did not authorize or appropriate any MENA-IF funding due to concerns about broad spending authorities. In FY2015, the Administration requested increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds. In FY2015, the Administration requested increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds.
