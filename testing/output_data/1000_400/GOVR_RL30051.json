    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The legislation extends and amends the 1990 base closure Act, with all actions on 451 installations completed by FY2001. The closures have resulted in net savings of $16.7 billion and annual recurring savings of $6.6 billion. The 1995 round of base closures was completed by the end of FY2001, producing net savings of about $16.7 billion. Additional closures were deemed necessary due to defense spending trends, leading to two more rounds in 1999 and 2001 as recommended in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Secretary of Defense William Cohen released the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), calling for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 to align infrastructure with force structure reductions and achieve significant cost savings for future readiness and weapons programs. The Secretary of Defense's plan for new rounds of base closures to reduce infrastructure and achieve cost savings faced opposition from Capitol Hill due to concerns over economic and political repercussions in their districts. Members of both defense committees declined to support new base closure legislation during mark-ups of the FY1998 DOD authorization bills. The Secretary of Defense's proposal for new base closures faced opposition on Capitol Hill, with concerns over economic and political fallout in districts. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve two more rounds of base closing in 1999 and 2001. Senators pledged to push for more closures to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate later voted against the initiative. Senator John McCain, Senator Dan Coats, and Senator Charles Robb, along with Senator Levin, pushed for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate voted against their initiative, opting for a substitute amendment that delayed new base closings until the DOD developed accurate cost measurement techniques. The DOD was required to submit a cost/savings report to Congress for potential base closings in 2001. Opposition in the House National Security Committee, led by Representative Joel Hefley, questioned the actual savings of base closures due to high upfront costs. DOD officials claimed net savings, but the Congressional Budget Office was unable to confirm this. The DOD officials claimed net savings from base closures, but the Congressional Budget Office could not confirm these estimates. Congressional opponents raised concerns about rushing into new closure rounds without fully understanding the military implications of previous closures. Despite lack of support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new base closure rounds. The DOD officials and the President pushed for new base closure rounds despite lack of support on Capitol Hill. Secretary of Defense Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for more closures to fund weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for annual savings of $2.8 billion. The Defense Reform Initiative announced two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 to save $2.8 billion annually. This was part of a larger effort to increase savings through outsourcing, paperless contracting, and reducing personnel. Support for the closures came from the DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel report. Support for additional base closures came from the DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel report, urging Congress and the Defense Department to act quickly. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of two more BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating military transformation. President Clinton's actions regarding the last round of closures were highly contentious. In endorsing the panel's findings, Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of two additional BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating military transformation. The base closure debate involved President Clinton's opposition to closing two Air Force maintenance depots despite recommendations for cost savings. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly depots, advocating for privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas. Opponents accused him of political meddling to gain favor in vote-rich states, while legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan. Opponents accused President Clinton of political meddling in the base closing process to curry favor with vote-rich states like California and Texas. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan, fearing job losses and vulnerability to future base closures. Resentment over Clinton's intervention persisted until the end of his second term, influencing opposition to new base closure rounds. Some Members opposed President Clinton's intervention in base closures, leading to resentment that persisted until the end of his second term. Legislation was passed to block DOD from privatizing depot maintenance work at certain air force bases unless efficiency criteria were met. A bill was passed to block privatization at certain depots unless efficiency criteria were met. The House and Senate committees approved depot-related provisions, but they were later removed due to a threatened filibuster. Efforts to restore the restrictions were unsuccessful in both chambers. In June 1997, Representative Terry Everett's attempt to remove depot-related restrictions in the House defense bill was defeated. Senator Inhofe later withdrew an amendment to restore the restrictions in the Senate bill. The depot-related language became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the FY1998 defense bill, with opposing camps unwilling to yield. The final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill was reached after a compromise was made to increase the limit on depot work by private contractors from 40% to 50%. The House passed the conference report on October 28, and the Senate debated the agreement the following day. The limit on depot work by private contractors was increased from 40% to 50%, but a broadened definition of \"core work\" offset the benefits. The House passed the conference report on October 28, and the Senate reached final agreement on November 6, with President Clinton signing the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85). The FY1998 defense authorization act included language prohibiting DOD from planning and implementing certain actions. The Senate reached final agreement on November 6, passing the conference report by a vote of 90 to 10. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85). Congress included language in the FY1998 defense authorization act that prohibited DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings was submitted. The Department of Defense submitted the report to Congress on April 2, 1998, ahead of the deadline. The Dorgan Amendment outlined ten \"Elements\" and eight \"Methods of Presenting Information\" for a report on base closures. The Department of Defense submitted the report to Congress ahead of the deadline set for January-February 1999. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, citing excess base structure and the potential savings for modernization and readiness. He highlighted the imbalance between force and base structures. The Secretary of Defense emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, citing excess base structure and potential savings for modernization and readiness. He highlighted the imbalance between force and base structures, pointing out significant disparities in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to berthing and classroom space reductions. The base closure report claimed that costs were lower than original estimates and projected similar savings for future rounds. The base closure report claimed lower costs than original estimates for past rounds and projected similar savings for future rounds. The Department of Defense expected net total savings of $14 billion through 2001, with annual savings of $5.6 billion thereafter. The Pentagon sought new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005 for additional savings of $3 billion a year. The Department of Defense revised the estimated savings from base closures to $5.6 billion annually. The Pentagon planned new closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 for additional savings of $3 billion per year. The report recommended following the model of previous closure commissions and highlighted the economic recovery of impacted communities. A controversial Air Force memo mentioned White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed. The controversy over base closures escalated with accusations of White House meddling in depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members strongly opposed new closures, using forceful language like \"dead on arrival\" and \"over my dead body.\" The level of suspicion and rhetoric increased on Capitol Hill in reaction to the proposed closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. The Administration was accused of meddling in the base closure process, leading to increased suspicion and strong opposition on Capitol Hill. The House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee were divided on the issue, with the Senate committee defeating a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin were key sponsors of new BRAC legislation. The Senate Armed Services Committee was more evenly divided on the issue of base closures than the House committee. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin, who were key sponsors of new BRAC legislation, sought support for a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. However, they abandoned their initiative as the majority was against them. In a floor action on June 25, the Senate voted in support of an amendment that would have made it harder for the Pentagon to proceed with base closings. The Senate voted 48-45 in support of an amendment to the FY1999 defense authorization bill that would have made it more difficult for the Pentagon to close bases. The amendment, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, aimed to restrict base closures and realignments, delaying the Department of Defense's actions. The Inhofe amendment aimed to restrict base closures by preventing the Pentagon from closing bases with more than 750 civilian personnel. It also expressed opposition to new rounds of closures until previous actions were completed. The amendment was dropped from the FY1999 defense authorization bill during conference. The Inhofe amendment was dropped from the FY1999 defense authorization bill during conference. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding DOD's estimates of savings consistent with its own estimates. BRAC savings are avoided costs that DOD cannot observe or record in its financial records, leading to estimated savings rather than measured ones. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's report on base realignment and closure, noting that future BRAC rounds could result in significant savings. However, DOD provided little analysis on potential closures and their impact on local communities. It was also mentioned that estimating savings from BRAC actions is challenging due to the nature of avoided costs. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's report on base realignment and closure, highlighting the lack of analysis on potential closures' impact on local communities. DOD was unable to provide some requested data, including original cost and savings estimates for BRAC commissions. GAO's review praised DOD for providing most required information, with more detail than CBO's review. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on base realignment and closure, giving generally good grades and affirming substantial net savings from previous BRAC closure rounds. GAO noted that DOD's report provided a rough approximation of costs and savings, with data systems not capturing all savings associated with BRAC actions. Additionally, DOD's analysis showed no long-term problems affecting military capabilities related to BRAC actions. The GAO reviewed DOD's report on base realignment and closure, noting that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings from BRAC actions. DOD's analysis showed no long-term issues affecting military capabilities related to BRAC actions. The report also mentioned that communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically. The proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted similarly to prior rounds. The DOD's report on base realignment and closure shows that some communities are faring better than others. Proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted like prior rounds. A legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a starting point for future legislation. Senator John McCain sponsored a bill for new rounds in 2001 and 2003, citing excess infrastructure capacity. Senator McCain, along with Senator Levin, sponsored a bill calling for new BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2003, citing excess infrastructure capacity and potential savings from base closures. The bill proposed changes to the selection process and restrictions on privatization-in-place. Senator McCain and his cosponsors proposed significant changes to the BRAC process in 2001. The selection process would start and end two months later than before, allowing a new President to nominate commission members. Privatization-in-place would only be allowed if recommended by the new base closure commission. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of base closures for improving efficiency and saving money, stating that wasteful spending on unneeded facilities was hindering military readiness. Senator McCain and his cosponsors proposed changes to the BRAC process in 2001, aiming to improve efficiency and save money by closing unneeded facilities. Despite appeals for two more closure rounds, opposition from Congress and constituents remained due to fears of base closures. Many Members of Congress opposed new closure rounds due to widespread fear among constituents. Secretary of Defense Cohen's call for two more closure rounds received a cool response in hearings before the House Armed Services Committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee and the full Senate rejected authorizing any new closure rounds, marking the third year in a row that DOD's attempts to shut down bases had been blocked. Opposition to base closures remained strong. The full Senate rejected a last-ditch effort to revive the base closure initiative by Senators McCain and Levin. The 60 to 40 vote marked the third consecutive year of opposition to shutting down more bases. With strong opposition in the House as well, it seemed unlikely that the initiative would progress further. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre highlighted the favorable economic conditions as a good time for Congress to consider the initiative. Defense Secretary Cohen emphasized the need for the base closing process to move forward. The FY2000 DOD budget proposal sought authority to close more military bases in 2003 and 2005. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre and Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for base closure improvements due to bureaucratic obstacles. Congress did not authorize new closure rounds in 2000 despite the Pentagon's concerns about costs and military upgrades. In 2000, the Pentagon sought authority for new base closures in 2003 and 2005, but Congress did not authorize them. Senator McCain and Senator Levin's amendment for two new closure rounds was rejected in a Senate vote. The debate reflected ongoing concerns about military base closures and realignments. In early 2001, Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill for new military base closures in 2003 and 2005. The Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating potential savings of $21 billion by 2015. Senator Hutchison had a differing opinion on the matter. The Department of Defense estimated potential savings of $21 billion by 2015 through closing excess military bases. Senator Hutchison expressed concerns about increasing restrictions on U.S. military training abroad and questioned the wisdom of closing more domestic bases prematurely. The Department of Defense proposed closing excess military bases to save $21 billion by 2015. Senator Hutchison questioned the wisdom of closing more domestic bases prematurely. The DOD urged Congress to approve another round of base closures, introducing the Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure. The Department of Defense proposed a new round of base closings and consolidations under the Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001. The proposal included transferring property to the local community, as demonstrated by Brooks Air Force Base. The Senate Armed Services Committee grappled with two base closure proposals and ultimately recommended a combination of both. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003, approved by the full Senate after a 17 to 8 vote in a closed session. General Henry H. Shelton emphasized the need to address excess infrastructure costs before the vote. The Senate approved a new round of base closures in 2003, marking the first success for proponents in five years. General Shelton and Secretary Rumsfeld highlighted the need to convert excess infrastructure for war-fighting. Opponents argued that the timing, with ongoing terrorism and economic uncertainty, was not ideal for base closures. Opponents of the proposal argued that the current war on terrorism and uncertain economy made it a bad time to close bases. Minority Leader Trent Lott expressed concerns about calling up reserves while considering base closures. Supporters emphasized the need to prioritize military resources for combating terrorism, trusting the Commander-in-Chief and defense leaders. The House FY2002 defense bill did not include base-closing language. Representative James Hansen mentioned this shortly after the Senate bill passage. Senator John McCain supported trusting the Commander-in-Chief and defense leaders during the stalemate over base closures in the House and Senate. After weeks of negotiations, a compromise was reached on December 10 and the President signed the defense authorization bill on December 12, 2001. After a stalemate over base closures, a compromise was reached on December 10, 2001, and the President signed the defense authorization bill on December 28, 2001. The bill retains most of the 1990 BRAC Act language with some modifications, including authorizing a new round in 2005 and requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit force structure plans. The 2001 defense authorization bill extends the 1990 base closure and realignment act to authorize a new round in 2005. The Secretary of Defense must submit force structure plans, review all types of installations, and certify the need for closure and realignment with annual net savings within six years. The 2001 defense authorization bill extends the 1990 base closure and realignment act to authorize a new round in 2005. The Secretary of Defense must certify the need for closure and realignment with annual net savings within six years. The commission's role is expanded to include increasing the number of members, allowing the Secretary of Defense to testify on commission-proposed additions of bases, and prohibiting privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases unless recommended by the commission. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld succeeded in winning approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005, despite previous unsuccessful appeals. The proposal to reduce excess infrastructure met with little enthusiasm from most Members of Congress. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld won approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005. Many communities near military bases are concerned about the survival of their installations and are developing strategies to keep their military units at home or acquire units from other parts of the country. Community leaders near military bases are working to keep their units at home or acquire units from other areas to ensure base survival. Range encroachment is a growing concern, with urban growth and other factors potentially de-valuing installations and making them targets for closure in 2005. Range encroachment is a concern for military bases, as it may de-value installations and make them vulnerable to closure in 2005. The BRAC timeline outlines the process for base closure nominations and approval."
