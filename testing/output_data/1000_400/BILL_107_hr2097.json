The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" aims to improve child care quality by addressing findings on early brain development, the importance of quality early care and education, and the high costs of full-day child care. Only 1 in 7 child care centers promote healthy development, while 1 in 8 threaten safety. Full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year. Federal assistance is limited, with many families unable to afford child care. Payment rates are too low to ensure quality care for all families. Low payment rates for child care affect the quality of care children receive, leading to reduced staff, lack of training, and fewer educational activities. This results in delayed development and increased aggression in children. The purpose of this Act is to improve the quality of child care by increasing payment rates, which in turn allows providers to hire qualified staff, provide training, maintain a safe environment, and purchase educational materials. Children in low-quality child care may experience delayed development and increased aggression. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for grants to improve the quality of child care is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. $500,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2002, with additional funds for subsequent years.
