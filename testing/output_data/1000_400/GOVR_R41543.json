    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held hearings on natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. This report highlights global natural gas markets, including supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. Natural gas emits less carbon dioxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides than coal or oil when used in power plants. The United States leads in shale gas extraction, with other countries slowly following suit. If more natural gas can be brought to market competitively, it could have a larger global economic impact. The United States has significantly increased its resource profile through shale gas formations, leading other countries to try to develop shale gas as well. Progress outside of North America is slow. If the U.S. and other countries can bring large volumes of natural gas to market competitively, it could have a greater impact on the world economy. Key factors such as price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations will determine the market's growth. Many countries are observing the development of U.S. unconventional natural gas resources, which could lead to a greater role for natural gas in the global energy mix. The United States has seen rapid growth in unconventional natural gas reserves and production, particularly shale gas. Shale gas now makes up over half of the country's proved natural gas reserves and production. This growth is being closely watched by many countries around the world, as natural gas is expected to play a larger role in the global energy mix due to its growing resource base and lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels. In 2015, global natural gas consumption grew by 1.7%, with the U.S. consumption increasing by 3%. Shale gas now accounts for 51% of U.S. natural gas reserves and 56% of production, leading to a potential shift from a net importer to a net exporter. The world consumed 122,442 bcf of natural gas, making up 23.8% of total global primary energy consumption, with the U.S. being the largest consumer at 22.8%. Global trade in natural gas is increasing, with new players entering the market on both the supply and import sides. Global natural gas consumption in 2015 reached 122,442 bcf, accounting for 23.8% of total global primary energy consumption. The United States was the largest consumer at 27,463 bcf, followed by Russia at 13,820 bcf. Despite a decline in Russia's consumption, the U.S. saw a 3% growth, contributing significantly to the global consumption increase of 1.7%. Natural gas consumption in Russia declined by 8% between 2011 and 2015 due to a weak economic environment. Global consumption grew at 1.7%, with the United States, Iran, and China experiencing significant growth. China, as the most populated country, is one of the largest global energy consumers, with natural gas accounting for about 5% of its energy consumption. China is expanding natural gas imports to enhance energy security. China, one of the largest global energy consumers, accounts for almost half of the world's total coal consumption. Despite a small percentage of natural gas usage at about 5%, China is increasing natural gas imports for energy security. Iran, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, faces stagnation in its energy sector due to sanctions and lack of investment. Domestic energy demand in Iran has risen by 50% since 2004, with natural gas making up 60% of its total energy consumption in 2014. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 has opened up opportunities for Iran's energy sector.

By 2040, shale gas production is projected to increase by 73%, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. LNG trade increased in 2015, with a 33% share in the global gas trade. Countries are expanding their LNG export capacity, with Australia and the United States increasing their capacity in 2016. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016 to meet the growing demand. The U.S. has been increasing its natural gas production, leading to a push for expanding LNG export capacity through modification and expansion of existing terminals. The rise in gas prices incentivized the industry to bring more domestic gas to market, reducing the need for import terminals. There is a push to modify and expand existing LNG terminals in the U.S. to increase export capacity, requiring authorization from the Department of Energy and FERC. Technologies like hydraulic fracturing have expanded the domestic gas supply, making unconventional resources economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions with unconventional gas sources. The development of unconventional natural gas resources in shale, coal seams, and tight rock formations has lowered production costs, making shale gas economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast, reducing the need for gas from traditional sources. This shift has decreased prices and imports, with future production expected from various shale plays. The United States has transitioned from being a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017, thanks to increased production from shale plays like Marcellus. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana. The Panama Canal reopening in June 2016 has reduced transit time from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Asian markets. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana to Brazil, India, and the United Arab Emirates. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, reducing transit time from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Asian markets. The U.S. is now in a strategic position in the global natural gas market, but questions remain about the impact on domestic gas prices and the economy. The United States is strategically positioned in the global natural gas market, raising questions about the impact on domestic gas prices and the economy. Concerns persist about the size of shale gas resources, sustainability of development, and potential limitations. Water use in hydraulic fracturing is a key issue, with worries about drinking water quality, competition for water, and wastewater disposal. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess hydraulic fracturing impacts. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water quality, competition for water, and wastewater disposal. Concerns also exist regarding deep-well injection and human-induced earthquakes, as well as emissions from the natural gas sector and their impact on human health. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane and VOC emissions in the natural gas sector. In 2016, the NSPS was updated to include additional equipment in the gas production chain, such as well sites, processing plants, and compressor stations. This is in response to concerns about human-induced earthquakes from deep-well injection and the impact of methane emissions on human health and the environment. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane and VOC emissions in the natural gas sector. In 2016, the NSPS was updated to include additional equipment in the gas production chain. Federal standards for methane emissions do not cover all sources of methane, such as offshore sources or coalbed methane production facilities. As natural gas production expands in the US, methane pollution becomes a significant concern for policymakers. About 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, mostly within regional markets, and the amount of natural gas traded is increasing. In the United States, methane is a significant air pollutant for policymakers due to the increasing integration of global and regional natural gas markets. About 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, with LNG trade increasing by 1.8% in 2015. LNG provides flexibility in destination compared to pipeline transport. U.S. LNG exports have influenced other countries to move away from oil-indexed gas prices. In 2015, LNG's global gas trade share was 33%. Natural gas is typically sold under long-term contracts tied to oil prices, except in the US. Long-term contracts, usually 20 years, are common for international gas trade due to expensive transportation costs. LNG producers can sell excess gas on the spot market. Russia is the largest natural gas exporter globally. The spot market for natural gas is growing, with LNG producers able to sell excess gas on a short-term basis. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, primarily through its pipeline network to Europe. Qatar leads in LNG exports, with Europe importing most of its natural gas from Russia, Norway, and Algeria. Asia is the most import-dependent region for natural gas. In 2015, 31% of the world's LNG trade went to Asia and Europe. Europe imports natural gas mainly from Russia, Norway, and Algeria, but is seeking more secure sources due to geopolitical tensions. Asia relies heavily on LNG, with China increasingly importing gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. The US and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico and Canada as the main recipients of US natural gas. Export projections show an increase in exports to Mexico and a slight rise to Canada by 2040. In 2015, more than 70% of Turkmenistan's exports went to China. The US and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico and Canada as the main recipients of US natural gas. Export projections show an increase in exports to Mexico and a slight rise to Canada by 2040. The export of US LNG has raised debates on its impact on the global market, geopolitics, and domestic prices. The export of U.S. LNG has been a topic of debate among policymakers, focusing on its impact on the global market, geopolitics, and domestic prices. Currently, there is one LNG export terminal in operation and several projects under construction in the lower-48 states. Additionally, the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska continues to supply LNG to Japan, and the United States has started shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami. The United States has LNG export terminals in Hackberry, LA; Freeport, TX; and Corpus Christi, TX. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan. LNG has also been shipped to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers. Prices for this LNG range from $10 to almost $16 per MBtus. Alaska has potential to be a major natural gas source according to the USGS. In 2014, LNG shipments were sold at higher prices than Sabine Pass exports, ranging from $10 to almost $16 per MBtus. Alaska has great potential as a major natural gas source, with estimates exceeding 200,000 bcf on the North Slope. However, most gas produced in Alaska is used for oil production, not brought to market. Alaskan officials have pushed for a pipeline to sell natural gas internationally as LNG, but it is considered commercially challenging as of 2016.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement may impact U.S. natural gas trade, granting free trade status to key consumers of LNG. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to promote trade and economic growth between the United States and the EU. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aim to promote trade and economic growth by granting free trade status to key consumers of LNG. The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which establishes measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP-21, held in Paris in 2015 aimed to address climate change and establish the Paris Agreement for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The United States signed the agreement in 2016. Concerns arise regarding the aging infrastructure for gas pipelines, with estimates of annual investment needed between $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion from 2015 to 2030, posing challenges amidst other infrastructure demands. Oil prices, new infrastructure, and technological advancements may impact both domestic and international markets. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines may range from $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion annually between 2015 and 2030, posing challenges amidst other infrastructure demands. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), known as gas OPEC, comprises 11 natural gas producing countries with a significant global market share. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is a cartel organization based in Qatar, formed in 2001 with 11 natural gas producing countries. They account for a large share of global natural gas reserves and trade. The GECF is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. natural gas consumption due to the U.S. resource base. Europe, heavily reliant on cartel members like Russia and Algeria for gas imports, is more vulnerable to potential cartel control. However, the current market structure limits supply and price manipulation. The United States is not a member of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). Europe is vulnerable to cartel control as over half of its gas imports come from cartel members like Russia and Algeria. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015, with the United States surpassing Russia as the largest producer in 2009. The success of the United States in shale gas has prompted other countries to evaluate their natural gas resources. The United States surpassed Russia as the world's largest natural gas producer in 2009, prompting other countries to evaluate their natural gas resources. Most countries lack the data, technology, and equipment needed to exploit shale gas resources, except for Canada. Commercial production outside of the US and Canada is unlikely before the end of the decade. Natural gas prices in the US, Canada, and the UK are market-driven, with hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA providing competitive price data. The price of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom is market-driven, with hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA providing competitive price data. By 2040, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to rise to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) due to increased demand, requiring more well completions for higher production levels. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to rise to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) by 2040 due to increased demand. This would necessitate more well completions to meet higher production levels. Natural gas is commonly sold under long-term contracts outside the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with prices linked to crude oil or oil-based products. The price of natural gas in long-term contracts is often tied to crude oil prices, despite natural gas no longer competing directly with oil. Producers are under pressure to move away from this pricing model due to price disparities between contracts and spot prices. Some producers are starting to incorporate spot prices into their formulas, reflecting regional differences in the natural gas industry. Asia, in particular, is willing to pay high prices for natural gas supplies. Take-or-pay clauses and destination clauses are also important contract concepts to consider. Incorporating spot prices for natural gas into pricing formulas reflects regional differences in the industry. Asia pays high prices for gas supplies. Take-or-pay clauses require buyers to pay regardless of gas receipt, while destination clauses allow redirection to different buyers. The natural gas industry faces the question of whether it should become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand for natural gas by 2040, with most of the growth coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. Destination clauses allow for redirection of gas shipments to different buyers, contributing to a more efficient market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a 60% increase in natural gas demand by 2040, mainly from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. China's shift to a services-focused economy may reduce future energy needs by 85%, while India is expected to be a growing market for natural gas. China is transitioning to a services-focused economy, potentially reducing future energy needs by 85%. India is projected to contribute significantly to global energy demand, requiring a substantial financial commitment. The U.S. electric power industry is leading the growth in natural gas demand due to various factors. Natural gas accounts for 6% of India's energy supply and is expected to make up less than 10% by 2040. The U.S. electric power industry drives natural gas demand growth due to factors like low prices and competitive financing. Global projections show natural gas will make up 28% of electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries leading. Production needs to increase to meet demand, with unconventional gas resources contributing 60% to global supply growth. Global natural gas production is projected to increase by 2040, with non-OECD countries leading the way. The rise in demand will require an increase in production, especially from unconventional gas resources like coal bed methane, shale gas, and tight gas. However, outside of North America, development of unconventional resources is slower and uneven. China has policies to encourage production, but challenges like limited water availability and population density in resource-rich areas may hinder full capacity realization. Global natural gas production is projected to increase by 2040, led by non-OECD countries. Challenges in resource-rich areas like limited water availability and population density may impede full capacity realization."
