    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until FY2011 when funding was eliminated. General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the end of F136 development on December 2, 2011. In FY2011, Congress eliminated funding for the alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter, leading to the termination of the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the single-engine Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the Joint Strike Fighter competition in 2001. In FY2011, Congress terminated the alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter, ending the competition for the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine. The F135 and F136 engines were designed to be interchangeable without modifying the F-35 airframe. Despite proposed terminations in FY2007, FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010, Congress continued funding the program. The alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter was terminated by Congress in FY2011, despite previous funding and support. The program was officially ended by the DOD in April 2011. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured. Developing a second engine for the F-35 would greatly increase costs and reduce the number of aircraft that could be procured. This would also raise maintenance costs and pose challenges for carriers. International interest in the F-35 is already strong, so a second engine is unnecessary. The F-35 program does not require a second engine for aircraft carriers due to limited space and facilities. International interest in the F-35 is already strong, and having a second engine is not necessary. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, and procurement of a single airframe design carries the risk of fleet grounding if there is a flaw in the design. The F-35 program does not need a second engine for aircraft carriers due to limited space. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants and airframes. The development of the F135 engine has progressed to a point where an alternate engine program is no longer necessary. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F135 engine in the F-35 program is being opposed due to concerns about compliance with the FY2008 defense authorization act. The causes of F135 test failures in 2007 and 2008 have been identified, and fixes are being implemented. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter Program to avoid reliance on a single engine type. This would allow for competition in engine procurement, reducing the risk of grounding the entire F-35 fleet due to engine issues. Having a second engine for the F-35 fleet would allow for competition in procurement, reducing costs and promoting better engine performance and reliability. It would also enable quicker production surges and maintain effective competition. Having two F-35 engine production lines would promote better engine performance, reliability, and contractor responsiveness. It would allow for quicker production surges and maintain effective competition in the development of future tactical aircraft engines. Additionally, having a second engine option would increase international interest in the F-35 program and maximize exports. The F-35 program aims to maximize exports by offering engine options to potential foreign buyers. The alternate engine program was terminated in 2011, with General Electric and Rolls-Royce ending development of the F136 engine in December 2011. Over $200 million in F136 hardware was located in various facilities. A spokesman for the alternate engine's builder mentioned that over $200 million in F136 hardware is spread across 17 facilities. General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the end of their self-funded development of the F136 engine in December 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program, including work on the F135 engine. The $7.3 billion funding for the F-35 program included $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The F135 SDD contract cost increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009, with $0.8 billion attributed to cost growth and $1.1 billion to expanded scope of work. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce team received $2.4 billion, including $1.7 billion for F136 engine SDD work. The F136 contract did not cover STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were developed under the F135 contract. Between FY1995-FY2009, $1.7 billion was allocated for SDD work on the F136 engine. The F136 team did not work on STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines. The government operated under continuing resolutions until the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act was enacted on April 15, 2011. Some members of Congress questioned the program's status during the CR period due to the Administration's opposition to further funding for the alternate engine program. Before the FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act on April 15, 2011, the government operated under continuing resolutions. Some members of Congress questioned the status of the alternate engine program during this period. CRs prohibited spending on new starts or procurement rates above FY2010 levels. The CR set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act for the base budget and military construction levels. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew stated that DoD would be expected to continue funding activities. The FY2010 Omnibus budget for military construction levels was maintained with reductions for BRAC funding not requested in FY2011, along with war funding provided in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act and the FY2010 Supplemental. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would continue funding activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified about the additional costs of the program. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that there is little advantage to the taxpayer of having a second engine, as most customers will only buy one due to limited logistics and space available on ships. The Air Force part is the only piece that could be competed. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, and there are concerns about encountering similar development problems as the first engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley mentioned the close call in deciding whether to invest further in the second engine during a hearing on February 23, 2010. The second engine, F136, has only completed 50 hours of testing, raising concerns about encountering similar development problems as the first engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed uncertainty about investing further in the second engine during a hearing on February 23, 2010. The Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz testified against investing in an alternate engine for the F-35 due to technological advancements in engine design and production. He emphasized that having more engines could result in fewer F-35s, which would not be beneficial for the Air Force or the Department of Defense. General Schwartz also mentioned the reliability of single-engine airplanes like the F-22 and F-18E/F, indicating comfort with their respective engines. Funding for the alternate engine was questioned on October 12, 2010. The F-18E/F are single-engine airplanes, with General Schwartz questioning the funding for an alternate engine for the F-35 on October 12, 2010. Adm. Gary Roughead and Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright expressed support for single-engine aircraft due to space constraints on carriers and cost considerations. Adm. Gary Roughead and Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright support single-engine aircraft for carriers due to space constraints and cost considerations. Developing an alternate engine would require significant investment in infrastructure and maintenance. The development of a second engine for aircraft involves significant upfront costs for infrastructure and maintenance. The question is whether the investment will lead to lower prices through competition. The Administration believed that the alternative engine program was no longer necessary as a backup, with minimal financial benefits from competition. The Administration proposed terminating the FY2010 program for the alternative engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, citing minimal financial benefits from competition and estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars. GAO testified that competitive pressures could offset costs over the program's life, but continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield savings to offset costs over the Joint Strike Fighter program's life. Continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. The \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s resulted in significant cumulative savings for acquisition and support costs. The \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s resulted in significant savings for acquisition and support costs, with a total of about 21 percent in overall life cycle costs. Proponents of the alternate engine argue that a competitor is needed to control costs, while the Administration believes the benefits do not outweigh the costs. Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135 engine in July 2009. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135 engine, leading to discussions on the need for a second engine. Secretary Gates mentioned cost growth is expected for developmental aircraft and allocated over $4 billion in the FY '10 budget to address program risks. The Administration believes fixing issues with the current engine is manageable and not worth funding a second engine. The Administration believes fixing issues with the current engine is manageable and not worth funding a second engine. In July 2009, DOD created a Joint Assessment Team to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure for the F135 engine. The team's charter included understanding production costs and developing a plan to address cost and affordability. Adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. The Defense Department created a Joint Assessment Team to investigate the production cost and affordability of the F135 engine. A Pentagon memo stated that adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. The memo supported the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The Pentagon memo explains that the cost of adding a second engine to the F-35 program is projected to be equivalent to a sole-source scenario. Despite reduced development costs for the F136 engine, the conclusion remains that having two competing F-35 engine programs does not provide a compelling business case. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional engines and support for flight testing and production improvements to the F135 engine. In February 2011, Pratt & Whitney announced receiving $1 billion for additional engines and support for flight testing of the F-35, with a focus on engine improvements for the F135 engine. Approximately $400 million was allocated for engine improvements, a third to meet original specifications and two-thirds to exceed specifications and enhance design robustness. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act directed three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program. The 2007 defense authorization act directed three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program, with studies showing differing conclusions on the financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits of an engine competition were also highlighted, including improvements in fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of industrial base, and stronger international relations. The 2007 studies on the F-35 engine program showed varying conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine. Non-financial benefits of engine competition included fleet readiness improvements, contractor responsiveness, industrial base sustainment, and enhanced international relations. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The study favored a dual-source approach based on past cost performance in acquisition efforts. The CAIG study analyzed past cost performance in acquisition efforts for the Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 program and the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. It assumed favorable conditions for a dual-source approach, predicting a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs with competition. The study estimated a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the program's lifetime to break even. The CAIG study estimated a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs with competition and a steeper rate of reduction in cost for subsequent engines. It found that a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the program's lifetime would be needed to break even. The study also stated that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve a 25.6% savings by 2040 for a break-even point. The CAIG study estimated that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve a 25.6% savings by 2040 for a break-even point. The study also discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, predicting weight growth in the aircraft would require a corresponding increase in engine thrust. The study highlighted the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating weight growth in the aircraft would necessitate increased engine thrust. Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine was nearing its temperature limits, requiring modifications for thrust growth. An F-35 engine competition could result in 11% to 18% savings. The IDA study examined engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating 11% to 18% savings. An alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur $8.8 billion in investment costs, requiring unrealistic procurement-cost savings of 40% to break even on an NPV basis. The study found that to break even on an NPV basis, the alternate engine program for the F-35 would require 40% procurement-cost savings, which was deemed unrealistic. It also mentioned that having an alternate engine could mitigate the risk of the entire F-35 fleet being grounded due to an engine problem. The IDA study highlighted contractor responsiveness as the main driver behind the Great Engine War, emphasizing the importance of having an alternate engine for the F-35 to prevent grounding the fleet. It suggested that industry competition could improve fleet readiness and lead to cost savings, with the GAO study indicating that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even. The potential financial benefits of engine competitions could offset investment costs, as stated by Michael Sullivan from GAO. The study suggested that financial savings of up to 20% could be achieved through engine competitions, potentially recouping investment costs. GAO's director believed the alternate engine program would break even by the late 2020s. Despite marginal financial benefits, the DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the program for its non-financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run can impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. The alternate engine program will continue for its non-financial benefits, despite marginal financial gains. The size of the F-35 production run will influence reaching a break-even point for the program, which is dependent on U.S. and foreign governments' procurement decisions and changes in the international security environment and defense budgets. The decision on the number of F-35s to purchase and the engine choice can change over time due to shifts in international security and defense budgets. Offers were made by GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney to build F136 and F135 engines at fixed prices after initial lots, with varying contract terms. Pratt & Whitney offered to reduce the price of the F135 engine after the initial lots, with a cost-plus contract proposal. GE/Rolls-Royce also made a fixed-price offer for F135 engines. A fixed-price contract for F135s was agreed upon for F-35s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with a 16% cost reduction compared to the previous lot. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006 outlined production, sustainment, and development of the JSF. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2006 outlines the production, sustainment, and development of the JSF Air System, including the production of the JSF Air Vehicle and propulsion systems. The Air Force confirmed that the MOU scope of work includes the development of primary and alternate propulsion systems, subject to the availability of U.S. resources. The Air Force's JSF MOU includes the development of primary and alternate propulsion systems, contingent on U.S. and partner nation funds. The PSFD MOU provision for cooperative production of F135 and F136 remains valid. Consultations with partners have been held regarding the exclusion of F136 in RDT&E funding requests. The MOUs will not be amended regardless of the U.S. FY10 funding outcome. The Administration's decision not to include the F136 engine in its RDT&E funding requests has been discussed with partners, but the JSF SDD and PSFD MOUs will not be amended regardless of the outcome. European countries with firms involved in both the F135 and F136 programs may reconsider the need for the second engine based on economic interests. The UK, along with other international partners, supports the F136 engine. The UK and other international partners support the F136 engine for the JSF program, expressing concerns about potential long-term costs if the second engine is canceled. Both F135 and F136 engines have faced development challenges, including failures during ground testing due to high-cycle fatigue. The F135 engine experienced failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008 due to high-cycle fatigue, resulting in delays for the F-35B aircraft. These engine malfunctions contributed to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million in the F135 program. Pratt & Whitney attributed damage to an F135 engine in 2009 to a worn bushing, leading to damage to fan blades. The F135 program experienced a cost overrun of up to $850 million due to engine failures. Pratt & Whitney identified worn bushings as the cause of damage to fan blades in the F135 engine. The F136 engine also encountered test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage to turbine blades. A minor redesign was implemented to address issues with loose nuts in the F136 engine. In 2009, an F136 engine ingested a test sensor and suffered impact damage to turbine blades. A nut coming loose led to a minor redesign. In 2010, another F136 engine sustained damage, prompting a design change. In 2011, F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue identified during testing. Pratt & Whitney confirmed engine replacements since March. Pratt & Whitney confirms that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares since March due to a misassembly issue identified in a ground-test engine at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney in 2009 for quality control deficiencies leading to increased F135 costs. Brigadier General David Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney for quality control issues that caused a 24% increase in F135 costs. Pratt & Whitney defended themselves, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate and overall, they were running at a 97% scrap rate for the total engine. William Begert, VP of business development, stated that the program is at an 80 percent yield rate, with a 97 percent scrap rate for the total engine. A General Electric F136 achieved 115% of required thrust in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to test a higher-thrust F135. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue or end the program. Congressional appropriations have supported the program from various funding sources. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue or end the program. Congressional appropriations have drawn on various sources of funds to support the program, which may impact other DOD programs. If funds are allocated within the existing F-35 budget lines, other activities may be curtailed in favor of the alternate engine program. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, which could impact other DOD programs if funds are reallocated within the existing F-35 budget lines. This could result in reducing the number of F-35s procured or causing delays in the program. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program at the expense of other defense programs. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program for the F-35, which could lead to transferring funds from other defense programs. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the program, potentially impacting the number of F-35s procured or causing delays in the program. The cost of fielding and supporting two F-35 engines is similar to just one engine, with additional funding needed for competition development. The FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program for the F-35, with additional funding needed for competition development. A February 2010 letter cited the need for an additional $2.9 billion over six years to develop the F136. The Government Accountability Office report stated that the funding projection could vary based on different assumptions and information. The $2.9 billion funding projection for developing the F136 engine could be affected by various assumptions. Different costs are being discussed, including the upfront cost and lifetime cost. Competition is seen as a way to control cost growth, but there are differing views on its impact. Congress may need to decide which assumptions to trust. The effects of competition on cost are crucial in these analyses. Competition is viewed as a check on cost growth in either competitor's product. Without competition, contracts are negotiated based on past experiences with similar products. Congress must weigh the risk of relying on a single engine type for the F-35 fleet against the benefits of procuring a second engine. The risk of relying on a single engine type for the F-35 fleet is a concern, as it could lead to all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues. Past incidents with other aircraft fleets due to engine problems highlight the potential risks. Terminating the F136 alternate engine program is argued to pose little operational risk by DOD officials. The Air Force grounded two fleets between 1990 and 2006 due to engine issues. DOD argues that terminating the F136 alternate engine program for the F-35 poses minimal operational risk. Advances in technology like computational fluid design and advanced software for health monitoring reduce the risks of relying on a single engine type. Prognostic health monitoring can reduce operational risks by allowing engines to diagnose their own condition and provide advanced warning of impending failures. This could lead to more efficient maintenance procedures and cost-effective operations. However, logistical issues may complicate the use of multiple engines, as seen in the Navy's limited facilities to support them. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead and Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz have differing views on the matter. The Navy and Air Force have differing views on the use of multiple engines. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead prefers one engine for carriers due to limited space, while Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz acknowledges the logistical challenges of supporting multiple engines. Congress may need to decide whether to direct multiple engines for one airframe. The Air Force has experience with multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets, like the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for the F-35. The debate is whether to pay GE $3 billion to compete with Pratt for fighter aircraft engines. General Electric's ability to compete in the market may be affected if the F136 engine is terminated. General Electric's position in the market for fighter aircraft engines could be impacted by the potential termination of the F136 engine. The debate revolves around whether the Pentagon should fund GE to compete with Pratt for future fighter aircraft engines. General Electric has a strong presence in the commercial engine market and supports various military aircraft engines for domestic and international clients. The 2007 CAIG and IDA studies highlighted General Electric's strong position in the commercial engine market, producing 1,000 commercial engines compared to Pratt & Whitney's 220. General Electric derives 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives 50%. Concerns arise about GE's ability to design fighter engines if the F136 program is terminated, as 200 military jet engineers may not be able to transfer their skills to commercial engines. The 2007 CAIG study highlighted concerns about General Electric's ability to design fighter engines if the F136 program is terminated, potentially reducing their competitiveness for future military engine contracts. Ending the F136 program could also impact the F-35 engine spare parts supply chain, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines may create uncertainty for suppliers regarding annual business volumes. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines could reduce workload for suppliers and create uncertainty. A 2007 study suggested that having multiple vendors for engine parts is feasible. The study also indicated that terminating the F136 engine program may not irreparably harm the U.S. industrial base, but expressed concerns about relying solely on a single engine producer. The 2007 IDA study found that terminating the F136 engine program may not irreparably harm the U.S. industrial base, but expressed concerns about relying solely on a single engine producer. The study concluded that having multiple vendors for engine parts is feasible and that the industrial base would be stronger with an active F136 program. The 2007 IDA study examined top F136 component suppliers and concluded that no supplier would exit the industrial base due to F136 termination. Competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney improved both companies and future engine development. Congress may consider non-monetary value of engine competition. H.R. 1540 passed in 2011 includes language barring funds for F-35 engine performance improvements unless developed. The House passed H.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for F-35 engine performance improvements unless competitively developed. The competitive procurement language aims to preserve existing F136 engines and tooling while allowing the contractor to conduct research and development at their expense. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 includes language prohibiting funds for F-35 engine performance improvements unless competitively developed. This aims to preserve existing F136 engines and tooling while allowing the contractor to conduct research and development at their expense. The limitation on funds for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program requires competitive development and production for any performance improvements. The term 'performance improvement' for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program refers to increasing fan or core engine airflow volume or maximum thrust for better takeoff performance. It excludes improvements in weight, costs, durability, and repair. The asset-preservation language mandates a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring it can be restarted if needed and allowing for long-term sustainment and repair. The plan also includes identifying costs for restarting development and providing support to the contractor at no cost to the Federal Government. The plan requires the preservation and storage of F136 propulsion system property, identifying costs for restarting development, providing support to the contractor for research activities, and determining necessary contract modifications or funding. The plan mandates the preservation of F136 propulsion system property and prohibits the disposal of related assets. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 45 days. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report to Congress on the plan for the F136 propulsion system. The committee supports the contractor's efforts to continue development despite program cancellation, emphasizing the importance of competition for the Joint Strike Fighter program's success. The committee supports the development of the F136 propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program, emphasizing the need for competition to improve engine performance and operational readiness. The Administration objects to limiting funds for performance improvements without competitive development. The Administration strongly objects to section 215, which limits funds for performance improvements to the F-35 Lightning II propulsion system without competitive development. They argue that this would lead to unnecessary costs and destabilize the program. Additionally, it would delay the development of the main engine and impact the viability of certain variants. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, a veto would be recommended. The Administration also strongly objects to section 252, which requires the storage and preservation of property developed under the F136 program, adding unnecessary costs during a period of fiscal restraint. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, on May 26, 2011, including language barring funds. The legislation imposes new requirements for preserving and storing over 250,000 pieces of Government property with suppliers, adding costs. The Senate passed S. 1867, barring funds for the F136 engine research and development. The Act prohibits funding for research on the F136 engine and restricts contractor expenditures on it. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system contract. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the disposition of property related to the F136 propulsion system contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential future use or disposal of the property. The Secretary of Defense must create a plan for handling property from the F136 propulsion system contract, allowing for preservation, storage, or disposal either by the Federal Government or a contractor. No funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of this property until 30 days after the required report is submitted. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 120 days outlining a plan for handling property from the F136 propulsion system contract. No funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of this property until 30 days after the report is submitted. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress outlining a plan for handling property from the F136 propulsion system contract. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act did not include funds for the F-35 alternate engine. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, part of H.R. 2055, did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The legislative history appendix covers FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill language and committee reports related to the program. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, which later became the F-35 program. It required a report on the program and allocated $7 million for competitive engine concepts. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, later becoming the F-35 program. $7 million was allocated for competitive engine concepts, with a report required on program requirements and planning assumptions. The Senate report questioned the program's ability to meet service needs and directed the inclusion of two approaches to reduce program risk, including evaluating at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies. The Senate report (S.Rept. 104-112) raised concerns about the lack of engine competition and the size of flying prototypes in the JAST program. The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology) was directed to ensure adequate engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft to lower program risks. The Defense (Acquisition & Technology) is directed to ensure engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft in the JAST program to lower risks. The conferees recommend authorization of funds for competitive engine concepts. The Senate report on the FY1996 defense authorization bill discussed the JAST program and the need for competitive support. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the FY1996 defense authorization bill discussed the JAST program and the need for competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee directed the Secretary to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale, full thrust aircraft demonstrators. The House Appropriations Committee directs the Secretary to evaluate two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale, full thrust aircraft demonstrators. The history of recent fighter engine propulsion plants shows challenges in developing new engines, with dissatisfaction leading to upgrades and competition between manufacturers. The Air Force upgraded early model F-14s with an Air Force engine and spent over a billion dollars to bring a second engine manufacturer for future fighter aircraft. The new engine for the F-22 is undergoing a redesign, and the JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps with a single unproven power plant design. This decision is deemed unwise due to past engine performance difficulties. The JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps with a single unproven power plant design. The Senate Armed Services Committee believes it is unwise to rely solely on one engine manufacturer and has provided additional funding for pursuing an engine design from a second manufacturer. The Senate Armed Services Committee has allocated an additional $20,000,000 for pursuing an engine design from a second manufacturer for the JAST program, emphasizing the benefits of engine competition in the FY1997 Defense Authorization Act.

The Secretary of Defense must request funding for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget submission, including amounts for the development and procurement of two propulsion system options. The F-35 program aims to ensure competitive production for the propulsion system. The House report recommends increased funding for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, specifically the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. This recommendation has been consistent over the past three years in committee reports accompanying defense authorization acts. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, noting that the Department of Defense has not complied with the requirement to include funds for this purpose in the budget request. The F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth since its inception in fiscal year 2002. The Department of Defense (DOD) has not included funds for the F135 engine development program in the budget request for the third consecutive year. The program has experienced cost growth since its inception in fiscal year 2002, with development costs increasing to $6.7 billion by the end of 2008, a 38% increase from the initial estimate of $4.828 billion. Additionally, F135 engine procurement costs have increased by 38 to 43% between December 2005 and December 2008. Costs for the F135 engine development program have grown to $6.7 billion, an increase of $1.872 billion or 38%. Engine procurement costs for the F-35 program have also increased between 38-47% from 2005 to 2008. In contrast, the F136 engine program has not experienced any cost growth since its inception. The F136 engine program has not seen any cost growth since its start, with stable costs estimated at $2.486 billion. Despite F135 cost increases and test failures, the committee questions the Department's decision not to include a competitive propulsion system program for the F-35. The committee recommends a $463.0 million increase for the competitive F-35 propulsion system program to address F135 cost growth and test failures. Additionally, an aggregate increase of $140.0 million is recommended for Aircraft Procurement, Navy and Aircraft Procurement, Air.

The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition noted significant cost increases in fiscal year 2009. The GAO report highlighted cost increases in the F135 engine contract for the F-35B and F-35A engines in fiscal year 2009. The Under Secretary of Defense directed a review by a Joint Assessment Team, which found credible but challenging improvement plans by the engine contractor requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. The Deputy Secretary of Defense submitted an update on the competitive engine program, indicating a need for an additional $2.9 billion investment over six years. The Deputy Secretary of Defense updated the committee on the need for a $2.9 billion investment over six years for the F136 engine development. The report highlighted that long-term costs for a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy would be the same as a one-engine approach. The committee questioned the Department's decisions to exclude a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 over the past five years. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M, citing benefits such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, and increased operational readiness. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M, citing benefits such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, and increased operational readiness. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor failed to meet cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense conducted reviews of the F-35 program, including JET 2 and IMRT. JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion increase in costs, while IMRT identified high production risks. To mitigate risks, the Department proposes additional measures like procuring an extra test aircraft and adjusting production plans. The Department of Defense proposes measures to reduce risks in the F-35 program, including procuring an additional test aircraft, adjusting production plans, and increasing budget for development. These actions are expected to delay completion by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more.

Late delivery of test aircraft and failure to adjust to reality are primary issues highlighted in recent testimonies. On March 24, 2010, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, including late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic development plans. The GAO's Director of Acquisition testified that the DOD plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The Department is expected to request a total of 550 aircraft by spring 2015. The DOD plans to procure 307 aircraft costing $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The Department is expected to request a total of 550 aircraft by spring 2015, which is over 22 percent of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s. Despite findings and continued research, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains the same as projected in fiscal year 2009. The GAO highlighted significant risks and impacts from required design changes during development testing. The committee recommends authorizing the budget request for 42 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, expressing concerns about the high production ramp rate and the need for further reductions until developmental testing is complete. The committee recommends authorizing the budget request for 42 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, with concerns about the high production ramp rate and the need for further reductions until developmental testing is complete. A provision is recommended to require certification of certain milestones before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. Administration objects to the additional $485 million for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Extra Engine. The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $485 million for the extra engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) and associated legislative provisions that limit overall JSF development funding until funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program. The Administration opposes the $485 million addition for the extra engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, stating that further investment of $2.4 billion would be needed for the program to be viable. The Department does not believe the cost will be recovered through competition and should not be diverted from other defense needs. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, a veto would be recommended by the President's senior advisors. The current engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. The report recommends a certification requirement before further funding is allocated for the alternate engine development. The committee recommends a provision for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the development of the alternate propulsion system will reduce costs and improve readiness without disrupting the program or reducing the number of aircraft procured. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify an amount for the F-35 program. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify an amount for the F-35 alternate engine program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding the program, designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram. The explanatory statement included an amended version of the House language designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft major defense acquisition program.

The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, with requirements for program cost growth thresholds to be met. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine in the FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act, with the funds added by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version of the Act did not allocate funds for the alternate engine program, but commented favorably on it. The program was funded at FY2010 levels through a continuing resolution until March 24, 2011. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels, funding the F-35 alternate engine program until March 24, 2011. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided no funds for the program. On February 16, 2011, the House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the alternate engine program. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) eliminated $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. The Act, signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided funding for the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2011. Congress's interest in the alternate engine program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 for Air Force F-16 fighters. The \"Great Engine War\" was an annual competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 to produce engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. The Air Force pursued an alternate engine for the F-16 due to frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management and concerns about using a single type of engine for their fighter fleet. Congress funded General Electric to develop the F110 engine as an alternate option. Congress provided funding through the Engine Model Derivative Program for General Electric to develop the F101 engine (later F110) as an alternate engine for the F-16. The competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for F-16 engines aimed to improve durability and reliability, with the goal of enhancing combat effectiveness and pilot survivability. The Great Engine War was unprecedented and controversial, with proponents believing it led to better engines at lower costs through competition. Critics argued it jeopardized combat effectiveness. Studies found that contractor responsiveness was the main benefit. Competition led to better contract terms, warranties, and engine improvements offered earlier than expected. The Great Engine War led to better contract terms, warranties, and early engine improvements by Pratt & Whitney. The Air Force demanded cost projections for six years from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney before awarding contracts. This led to firm-fixed price contracts for six years. The Air Force required six years of cost projections from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for engine production, support equipment, spare engines, technical data, and dual sourcing data. Contractors were held to firm-fixed price contracts for six years to prevent disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. This was a new requirement, as contracts typically only covered production, not operations and support work. The DOD required contractors to provide plans for dual sourcing critical parts to prevent disruptions in production and price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011 due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. The decision was made as the U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program, despite the F136 engine development being almost 80 percent complete. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011. The program was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense in April, despite the engine development being almost 80 percent complete. The FET will fulfill its termination responsibilities with the government after 15 years of developing a competitive fighter engine with advanced propulsion technologies. The FET, a joint venture between GE and Rolls-Royce, successfully developed the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. They received high marks from the DoD for delivering on cost and schedule. GE and Rolls-Royce advocated for defense acquisition reform and emphasized the importance of competition in the process."
