    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution. Concerns exist about enforcement adequacy and jurisdictional differences, with a focus on the environmental impact of the cruise industry. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping fleet, has raised concerns about its environmental impacts. Despite its significant economic contributions to the U.S., including $40 billion in benefits and over 357,000 jobs in 2009, the industry faces scrutiny for its activities. With a 7.4% annual growth rate in the number of cruise passengers worldwide since 1990, the industry hosted an estimated 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The cruise industry contributes $40 billion to the U.S. economy and generates over 357,000 jobs. The industry's environmental impacts are a concern. The worldwide cruise ship fleet has more than 230 ships, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies make up nearly 95% of passenger ships in U.S. waters. New ships are added each year, with increasing size and luxury. The cruise ship industry continues to grow with new, larger, and more luxurious ships being added to the fleet each year. The average ship size has been increasing significantly over the past two decades. Safety and environmental concerns are key issues for the industry, as cruise ships are like \"floating cities\" generating large amounts of waste. Cruise ships, like \"floating cities,\" produce vast amounts of waste during voyages, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Improper disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of laws regulating waste management on cruise ships. Improperly treated wastes from cruise ships can endanger human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of current laws in managing these wastes, with weak enforcement noted. A 2000 GAO report highlighted issues of cruise ships violating environmental regulations, with 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. The majority of cases involved oil or oil-based product discharges, ranging from small amounts to hundreds of gallons, while the rest involved plastic or garbage discharges. The GAO reviewed illegal discharge cases from cruise ships in U.S. waters over a six-year period. 83% of cases involved oil or oil-based products, with volumes ranging from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. 72% of discharges were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of all illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships during this time. Several high-profile cases have led to criminal prosecutions and large fines. Several high-profile pollution cases involving cruise ships in U.S. waters have led to criminal prosecutions and multimillion-dollar fines. In 2000, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address cruise ship pollution, leading to a study on cruise ship discharges and waste management. EPA issued recommendations for further assessment through data collection and public hearings, culminating in a cruise ship discharge assessment report in December 2008. In 2000, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to study cruise ship discharges and waste management. The EPA issued a background document with recommendations for further assessment. In December 2008, a cruise ship discharge assessment report was released, summarizing waste streams, findings, and options to address ship discharges. The report addresses issues related to cruise ship pollution, including types of waste streams, contaminants, and laws regulating pollution from cruise ships. This report presents information on cruise ship pollution, including the various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships. It discusses the complex body of international and domestic laws regulating pollution from cruise ships, with some gaps in regulation. The report also mentions federal and state legislative activities in Alaskan waters and other states, as well as efforts by cruise ship companies to prevent illegal waste discharges through waste management plans and practices. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to improve environmental operations and prevent illegal waste discharges. Environmental critics support stricter regulations on cruise ship waste, with legislation introduced in Congress but no action taken. Cruise ships generate various waste streams like sewage, graywater, and oily bilge water. Cruise ships generate various waste streams, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, which can pose threats to human health and aquatic life if not properly treated and disposed of. Despite being a small part of the international shipping industry, cruise ships are highly visible. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to regulate cruise ship waste, but no action has been taken. Cruise ships, while a small part of the international shipping industry, have the potential to threaten human health and damage aquatic life with their waste streams. Specific concerns include sewage, graywater, and solid waste due to the large number of passengers and crew on board. Their concentrated activities in coastal areas like Florida, California, and Alaska could have a significant local impact. Cruise ships, with their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas like Florida, California, and Alaska, can have a significant impact on the environment. Blackwater, which is sewage containing harmful bacteria and nutrients, can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Excessive algal growth caused by nutrients in sewage can lead to fish kills and destruction of aquatic life. On average, cruise ships generate 8.4 gallons/day/person of sewage. Treated sewage from cruise ships can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage promote excessive algal growth, leading to fish kills and destruction of aquatic life. Cruise ships generate 8.4 gallons/day/person of sewage, with large ships producing 15,000 to 30,000 gallons per day. Graywater from ships contains various pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, and nutrients. EPA and Alaska state sampling found untreated graywater can contain pollutants at varying strengths. Graywater from cruise ships can contain a variety of pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, organics, petroleum hydrocarbons, nutrients, food waste, and medical and dental waste. EPA and Alaska state sampling found that untreated graywater can have higher levels of fecal coliform bacteria compared to domestic wastewater. On average, cruise ships generate 67 gallons/day/person of graywater, which is the largest source of liquid waste on board. Graywater from cruise ships, the largest source of liquid waste on board, can contain pollutants like fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, and nutrients. Solid waste on ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, cans, and plastics, which can become marine debris and harm marine life. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, minimization, recycling, and incineration, with up to 75% of waste incinerated on board. Ash is typically discharged at sea, posing a threat to marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Marine debris from cruise ships poses a threat to marine life and coastal communities. Solid waste management includes source reduction, recycling, and incineration, with up to 75% of waste incinerated on board. This waste can harm marine mammals, fish, sea turtles, and birds through entanglement. Each cruise ship passenger generates two pounds of solid waste per day, leading to massive amounts of waste generated during a cruise. Cruise ships generate large amounts of solid waste, with each passenger producing two pounds of waste per day. This results in about 8 tons of solid waste generated during a one-week cruise on a large ship. Approximately 24% of the solid waste from vessels worldwide comes from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board, but hazardous wastes are produced from various activities on the ship. Port reception facilities can be strained by the off-loading of waste from cruise ships. Cruise ships can strain port reception facilities with hazardous waste generated from various onboard activities like photo processing and equipment cleaning. These wastes contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and chemicals that are toxic to marine organisms if not managed carefully. Hazardous waste generated on cruise ships includes hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals, paint waste, solvents, fluorescent and mercury vapor light bulbs, various batteries, and pharmaceuticals. The toxicity of these wastes to marine organisms can be significant if not managed carefully. Oil leaks from engine spaces mix with water in the bilge, posing threats to marine life and human health. Bilge water may also contain solid wastes and pollutants with high oxygen-demanding material. The bilge of a ship can contain harmful substances like oil, gasoline, and byproducts from petroleum breakdown, posing threats to marine life and human health. Chemicals in bilge water, such as detergents and degreasers, can be toxic to marine organisms if discharged. Large vessels may have additional waste streams with oily mixtures that can enter the bilge, with a typical cruise ship generating eight metric tons of oily bilge water every 24 hours. Large vessels, including cruise ships, generate oily bilge water that needs to be extracted and treated before discharge to prevent harm to marine life. If the oil extraction process is faulty or bypassed, untreated bilge water can be directly discharged into the ocean, causing environmental damage. EPA considers bilge water discharge as a common threat to marine ecosystems. If a separator used to extract oil from bilge water is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water may be discharged into the ocean, harming marine life. EPA identifies bilge water as a major source of oil pollution from cruise ships, leading to environmental violations. Ballast water is crucial for stabilizing large vessels like cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers during transport, taken on in coastal waters and discharged at the next port to reduce the need for compensating ballast. Ballast water is essential for stabilizing ships like cargo carriers, taken on in coastal waters and discharged at the next port to reduce the need for compensating ballast. However, the discharge of ballast water containing biological materials can introduce invasive species, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems and public health. Ballast water typically contains a variety of biological materials, including non-native species that can cause ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems. Studies suggest that the economic cost from introduction of pest mollusks to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is about $2.2 billion per year. Further study is needed to determine the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. The economic cost of introducing pest mollusks to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is approximately $2.2 billion per year. Cruise ships contribute to the problem of non-native species introduction, but there is a lack of specific data on their impact. Diesel engines on cruise ships emit harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, classified as likely human carcinogens by the EPA. Ocean-going vessels are estimated to account for about 10% of mobile source air pollution. Diesel exhaust from marine diesel engines is classified as a likely human carcinogen by the EPA. Ocean-going vessels contribute significantly to air pollution, emitting nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and greenhouse gases. International shipping is estimated to have contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. Additionally, ships emit black carbon and other pollutants. Ships, including marine diesel engines, are significant sources of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. International shipping contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. Vessels emit black carbon and nitrogen oxides, impacting air quality both at sea and in port. Cruise ship emissions, while a small fraction of the shipping fleet, are a concern for regional air quality. Cruise ship emissions, including incinerators burning waste, can impact regional air quality even in areas without large ports. International protocols and U.S. laws govern waste disposal on ships, but there are gaps and overlaps in regulations. The waste generated by cruise ships must be disposed of properly to avoid toxic emissions from incinerators. International protocols and U.S. laws regulate waste streams on cruise ships, with the International Maritime Organization setting standards for vessel safety and pollution prevention. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to its requirements. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) enforces pollution standards for cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries. Six Annexes of the Convention address various sources of pollution, including regulations for oil and control of noxious liquid substances. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities, but international objectives require ratification and implementation by sovereign states. The MARPOL Convention's Annexes address pollution prevention measures for oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage disposal, and emissions from marine vessels. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary. The MARPOL Convention's Annexes cover pollution prevention measures for oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage disposal, and emissions from marine vessels. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary, and ratification by member countries is required for the standards to become binding. The United States has ratified several Annexes, with the most recent being Annex VI in May 2005. The MARPOL Convention's Annexes cover pollution prevention measures for various substances from marine vessels. The United States has ratified several Annexes, including Annex VI in May 2005. The flag state of a ship is responsible for certifying compliance with MARPOL standards. IMO has established conventions on issues like ballast water management and passenger safety. Each nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and comply with related laws of other nations. The MARPOL Convention's Annexes address pollution prevention measures for marine vessels. The United States ratified Annex VI in May 2005. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to comply with the convention and related laws of other nations. In the US, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships implements MARPOL provisions, with the most recent action in April 2006 ratifying Annex VI to regulate air pollution. Congress approved legislation in July 2008 to implement Annex VI standards through EPA regulations. The United States ratified MARPOL Annex VI in April 2006 to regulate air pollution. Congress approved legislation in July 2008 to implement the standards through EPA regulations. Amendments to Annex VI were made in October 2008 after international negotiations. APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard responsible for enforcement. The United States ratified MARPOL Annex VI in April 2006 to regulate air pollution. APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged ships worldwide and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard enforcing regulations. Implementation challenges arise from the international nature of maritime shipping, allowing countries to verify compliance and detain non-compliant ships. The U.S. can enforce laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge. The United States can enforce laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction, while coordination with flag states is required for incidents outside U.S. jurisdiction. The response rate from flag states has been poor, as documented in a 2000 GAO report. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, but no single agency is responsible for oversight. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for better coordination between the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states regarding pollution discharge incidents on foreign-flagged ships. In the United States, various federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships, with the Coast Guard and EPA playing key roles in regulation and enforcement. The Department of Justice handles prosecutions, while the Department of State deals with international matters and foreign-flag violations. Other agencies like NOAA also have limited roles in collaboration with the Coast Guard and EPA. The Department of State represents the United States at international meetings and treaty negotiations related to maritime laws. Other federal agencies like NOAA and APHIS have limited roles in collaborating with the Coast Guard and EPA on marine debris and food-contaminated garbage disposal. States and localities may also have responsibilities. The Clean Water Act is the main U.S. law regulating pollution in water bodies. The Clean Water Act is the principal U.S. law concerned with limiting polluting activity in water bodies. The act's NPDES program controls pollutant discharges from point sources, including vessels. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from the requirement to obtain an NPDES permit under the act. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated sewage discharge from vessels into US navigable waters within 3 miles of shore. Cruise ships must comply with this regulation, using marine sanitation devices to prevent sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard enforces the prohibition. Ships must comply with Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits untreated sewage discharge within 3 miles of shore. Marine sanitation devices (MSDs) are required for vessels with installed toilets to prevent sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard enforces regulations and certifies compliance. MSDs can either hold sewage for shore disposal or treat it before discharge. Large vessels, like cruise ships, use Type II or Type III MSDs, with Type II treating waste chemically or biologically to meet specific limits. The Coast Guard regulations cover three types of Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) for large vessels, including cruise ships: Type II treats waste before discharge, Type III stores waste for later treatment, and Type I disinfects sewage before discharge. Type I MSDs are typically found on smaller vessels and must meet specific performance standards. The regulations, unchanged since 1976, do not require ship operators to monitor or report on sewage discharge. The regulations for Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) on large vessels, including cruise ships, have not been revised since 1976. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage before discharge and must meet specific performance standards. Critics point out deficiencies in the regulatory structure as it only covers bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, while other sources subject to NPDES permits must comply with more stringent requirements for various pollutants. The NPDES permit program regulates a wider range of pollutants than the MSD rules, including chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, oil, and grease. Compliance with sampling, monitoring, and reporting requirements is mandatory for NPDES permits but not for MSD rules. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of MSD rules, with limited ability to detect violations of environmental law. The GAO reported in 2000 that Coast Guard inspectors struggle to inspect sewage treatment equipment on cruise ships due to various limitations, including focus on safety, large ship size, limited time and staff, and lack of surprise in inspections. The Coast Guard has a wide range of responsibilities, including homeland security and non-homeland security tasks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has shifted more resources towards homeland security efforts. The Coast Guard has a wide range of responsibilities including homeland security and non-homeland security tasks. Since 9/11, resources have shifted towards homeland security efforts, potentially reducing time for vessel inspections for environmental compliance. MARPOL's Annex IV regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment equipment or holding tanks on ships. MARPOL's Annex IV regulates sewage discharges from vessels by requiring sewage treatment equipment or holding tanks. The regulation applies internationally to cruise ships flagged in ratifying countries, but the United States has not ratified Annex IV, making it non-mandatory in U.S. waters. The requirements are minimal compared to U.S. rules for MSDs, with no specific performance standards prescribed. Within three miles of shore, sewage discharges must be treated by a certified MSD, while between three and 12 miles, maceration or chlorination is required. Sewage discharges beyond 12 miles from shore are not regulated. MARPOL's Annex IV regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring treatment equipment or holding tanks. Within three miles of shore, sewage must be treated by a certified MSD; between three and 12 miles, maceration or chlorination is required. Beyond 12 miles, sewage discharges are unrestricted. In U.S. waters, vessels must comply with Clean Water Act regulations, with some cruise ships using Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for improved sewage treatment. Some cruise ships, especially those in Alaskan waters, use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage treatment, which are effective in removing various substances. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act also establishes no-discharge zones for vessel sewage, allowing states to prohibit sewage discharge within their jurisdiction. Metals and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) can be addressed through establishment of no-discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act. States can prohibit sewage discharge from vessels with installed toilets into certain waters within their jurisdiction. NDZs are designated based on the need for environmental protection and the availability of pumpout facilities. As of 2009, 26 states have established NDZs to protect waters from sewage discharges by cruise ships and other vessels. No-discharge zones (NDZs) under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act are designated for environmental protection and availability of pumpout facilities. NDZs have been used in 26 states to prevent sewage discharge from vessels with installed toilets. Special NDZs are designated for environmentally sensitive areas and drinking water intake zones. Examples include the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Hudson River in New York. The 2008 Discharge Assessment Report by the EPA suggested various options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within 3 miles from shore, and imposing uniform requirements on all ships. Graywater is not considered a pollutant under current federal law. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant and there are no separate federal effluent standards for graywater discharges. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. In Alaska, graywater must be treated before discharge into state waters. EPA issued guidelines in 2008 for addressing sewage from cruise ships, including sampling and testing of wastewater treatment equipment. The purpose of regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes under Section 312 MSD requirements includes limits for bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids in graywater. Alaska and EPA have laws and permits in place for treating and restricting graywater discharges. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries to restrict graywater discharges to protect sensitive ecosystems. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas where graywater discharges from vessels may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. EPA has identified options for addressing graywater discharges, including establishing standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties for non-compliance. Cruise ship discharges of solid waste are governed by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act regulates cruise ship discharges of solid waste, prohibiting dumping without a permit. EPA issues permits for disposal at sea, excluding dredged material. EPA has proposed options for managing graywater discharges, such as standards, restrictions, monitoring, and penalties for non-compliance. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates cruise ship discharges of solid waste in U.S. territorial seas and ocean waters. EPA issues permits for disposal at sea, excluding dredged material. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also applies to cruise ships, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and its regulations apply to cruise ships, prohibiting garbage discharge within specific distances from shore. The Coast Guard administers APPS, ensuring port facilities can handle solid waste. EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, prompting potential amendments to MARPOL Annex V by the IMO. EPA has suggested options to address solid waste from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. The EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, leading to potential amendments to MARPOL Annex V by the IMO. Options to address solid waste from cruise ships include increasing on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, prohibiting discharge of incinerator ash into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and enforcing no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment through monitoring and sanctions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and facilities. Hazardous waste is defined by its characteristics or appearance on specific lists. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must have permits and comply with EPA regulations. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste, defining it based on characteristics or specific lists. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ships may generate and transport hazardous waste, facing challenges in waste identification and compliance with RCRA requirements. Hazardous wastes generated onboard cruise ships are stored until offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA. Activities onboard generate toxic substances subject to RCRA, such as chemicals used in cleaning, painting, beauty parlors, and photo labs. It is unclear which regulations apply to managing and disposing of these wastes. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA regulations for hazardous waste generated from operations like maintenance and passenger services. Uncertainty exists regarding the classification of cruise ships as small or large generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less stringent requirements. Some cruise companies argue that they should be classified as \"conditionally exempt small-quantity generators\" of hazardous waste, which would entail less stringent requirements. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) could potentially be triggered by a release of hazardous substances from a cruise ship, but it has not been utilized in response to such incidents. CERCLA requires immediate notification of hazardous substance releases from vessels to the National Response Center. EPA has identified 500 hazardous substances and set rules for reportable quantities, starting as low as 1 pound. The President can authorize remedial action through the Coast Guard in coastal waters. The EPA has identified 500 hazardous substances and set rules for reportable quantities as low as 1 pound. CERCLA authorizes the President to take remedial action through the Coast Guard for hazardous substance releases from vessels. Hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are also regulated under the Clean Water Act. EPA has proposed options like establishing BMPs to reduce contaminants in hazardous wastes on cruise ships. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into U.S. navigable waters or the contiguous zone. The EPA has proposed options to address hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships, such as establishing standards of BMPs and increasing inspections. Section 311 of the Clean Water Act applies to cruise ships and prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. waters. The Clean Water Act and Coast Guard regulations prohibit cruise ships from discharging oil or hazardous substances into U.S. waters within 12 miles from shore. Vessels must use oil water separators and maintain an Oil Record Book for disposal of oily residues and bilge water. Beyond 12 miles, oil or oily mixtures can be discharged if the oil content is less than 100 ppm. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution, applying to all U.S. flagged and foreign flagged vessels operating in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard regulations prohibit the discharge of oil within 12 nautical miles of land, except under limited conditions. The Coast Guard regulations under the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land in U.S. waters. However, these regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations due to most cruise lines being foreign registered. Most cruise lines have their own policies restricting discharges within three miles from shore. EPA has suggested options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships, including establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet standards, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA proposed options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships, such as setting standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet standards, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. Clean Water Act regulations exempted ballast water and other discharges from NPDES permit requirements, but concerns over invasive species led to a petition in 1999 to repeal this exemption. In January 1999, conservation organizations petitioned EPA to regulate ballast water discharge as a pollutant under the Clean Water Act, citing concerns over invasive species. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, maintaining that the exemption for ballast water discharge is a long-standing policy. In 2003, EPA stated that the exclusion of ballast water discharge from the Clean Water Act is a long-standing policy, supported by Congress in 1979 and 1996. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges became mandatory in 2004, with all vessels required to have a management plan. Environmental groups sued EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water from permitting, leading to a federal court ruling in their favor in 2005. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit to force EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting. A federal court ruled in their favor in 2005, ordering EPA to set aside the exemption by September 30, 2008. The ruling also applies to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. The court's ruling in response to environmental groups' lawsuit ordered EPA to rescind the exemption for ballast water discharges by September 30, 2008. This ruling also applies to other vessel discharges such as graywater and bilge water. In December 2008, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) for an estimated 69,000 large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. The VGP covers pollutant discharges incidental to the normal operation of non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, as well as ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. It covers discharges into U.S. waters and includes 26 types of waste streams, such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxic pollutants. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including ballast water and bilge water discharges. It includes 26 types of waste streams, such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices are used to control most waste streams, with specific requirements for ballast water and bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting are also required. The draft VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, focusing on ballast water and bilge water discharges. It includes BMPs, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. The VGP does not cover sewage discharges or toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships. Cruise ships are subject to detailed requirements for graywater, pool, and spa water discharges, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual pollutants. Under the VGP, cruise ships are subject to detailed requirements for certain discharges, such as graywater and pool water, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual chlorine. Operational limits are also imposed on cruise ship graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. The 110th Congress considered legislation for a uniform national approach to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water under Coast Guard administration. The 110th Congress considered legislation for a uniform national approach to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water under Coast Guard administration, with some opposition due to concerns about preempting state regulations and lack of citizen suit provisions. No further action was taken on this legislation. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to set health-based standards for air quality and emission standards for sources of pollution. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until 2003 when EPA established standards for marine diesel engines on large vessels. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels, including cruise ships, following a settlement with the environmental group Bluewater Network. The standards are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides. The EPA established emission standards for large marine vessels in 2003, equivalent to international standards for nitrogen oxides. The rule applies to ocean-going vessels like container ships, tankers, and cruise ships, previously not regulated by the EPA. This rule is part of EPA regulations for nonroad engines under the Clean Air Act, with plans for more stringent standards for very large marine engines in the future. In 2003, the EPA established emission standards for large marine vessels, including ocean-going ships like container ships and tankers. The EPA planned to review technology for more stringent standards for very large marine engines in the future, aiming to align with international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized the exclusion of foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, leading to a federal court challenge in 2004. The rules were upheld, but the EPA stated it would consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for stricter standards. In 2003, the EPA established emission standards for large marine vessels, including ocean-going ships. Environmental groups criticized the exclusion of foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, leading to a federal court challenge in 2004. The rules were upheld, but the EPA stated it would consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for stricter standards. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and in October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. In December 2009, EPA promulgated changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3. In 2011, new global nitrogen oxide standards and in 2012, new global fuel sulfur standards were implemented, along with stricter emission controls in designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The United States supported these amendments during IMO negotiations. In December 2009, EPA made changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with IMO requirements, establishing emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The EPA rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged or registered vessels, while foreign vessels are subject to MARPOL Annex VI limits enforced through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS). In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA. A treaty amendment to Annex VI will be circulated among IMO members, with ships in the area facing stricter emission limits for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter from 2014. Various laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas, such as the Clean Water Act treating navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as distinct entities. Beginning in 2014, ships in the designated area will face stricter emission limits for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters as the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas. President Reagan's proclamation in 1988 extended the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. President Reagan's proclamation in 1988 extended the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. President Clinton's proclamation in 1999 gave U.S. authorities the right to enforce laws at sea within 24 nautical miles. President Clinton's 1999 proclamation extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile contiguous zone. This did not change the statutory definition of the territorial sea, which remains 3 miles wide under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act defines the territorial sea as 3 miles wide, with the contiguous zone extending from 3 to 12 miles. Jurisdictional limits are important as they determine where specific laws apply, such as the Clean Water Act's MSD standards for sewage discharges from vessels. The MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas beyond the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured. The jurisdictional limits beyond the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured are defined by the Convention of the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. Specific laws apply to areas such as sewage discharges from vessels into navigable waters, oil or hazardous substances discharges, and regulations from the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) addresses discharges of oil or hazardous substances into navigable waters. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. Clean Water Act refers to distances in terms of miles without qualification. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to the increase in passengers during the 1990s. The Clean Water Act, APPS, and MPRSA have different measures for distances from shore, with nautical miles being longer than international or statute miles. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to the increase in passengers during the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska, part of a larger federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines admitted to knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska, as part of a larger federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Public concern led to the initiation of a program to identify cruise ship waste streams, revealing that waste treatment systems on most ships did not meet U.S. Coast Guard standards for Type II MSDs. Fecal coliform levels in blackwater and graywater greatly exceeded the Coast Guard standard. The Alaska cruise ship waste treatment systems did not meet U.S. Coast Guard standards, with fecal coliform levels far exceeding the limits. Federal legislation was passed in December 2000 to address these issues, setting standards for vessels with 500 or more passengers and prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge in Alaskan waters. EPA was authorized to establish further standards. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (P.L. 106-554) established standards for cruise ships with 500 or more passengers, prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge in Alaskan waters. EPA was authorized to set regulations for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships in these waters, with specific limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 set standards for cruise ships with 500 or more passengers, prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge in Alaskan waters. Vessels must meet specific effluent standards for discharges, with regulations implemented by the Coast Guard in 2001. The legislation sets standards for cruise ships in Alaska, including limits on fecal coliforms, total suspended solids, and residual chlorine concentrations. Vessel operators must sample, collect data, and keep records for Coast Guard oversight. Regulations were issued in 2001 with minimum sampling procedures and penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. EPA conducted a multi-year project to evaluate sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska, sampling wastewater from four ships in 2004 and 2005. The 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report summarizes the findings. Additionally, a survey on treatment device effectiveness was distributed in 2004. EPA collaborated with Alaska on a plume tracking survey and a study on sewage dilution in Skagway Harbor. The EPA conducted a multi-year project to evaluate sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. Sampling efforts showed that advanced wastewater treatment systems are effective in treating various contaminants. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to set standards for blackwater discharge. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to set standards and sampling requirements for the discharge of blackwater, extending the effluent standards to graywater due to high fecal coliform counts. Sampling requirements for all ships and effluent standards for blackwater discharges by large cruise ships took effect in 2001, with standards for graywater discharges by large vessels following in 2003. Effluent standards for graywater discharges by large vessels took effect in 2003. Small ships had three years to comply with all effluent standards. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. Large ships installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or held wastewater for discharge outside Alaskan waters. According to the state, large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have improved wastewater discharge quality by installing advanced treatment systems. However, small ships have not upgraded their systems, leading to pollutants exceeding state water quality standards. Small ships in Alaska have not upgraded wastewater treatment systems, leading to pollutants exceeding state water quality standards. Test results show risks to aquatic life and human health. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a $50 head tax for cruise lines per passenger, corporate income tax, increased fines for violations, and new environmental regulations. Taxes will benefit local communities and public services. Alaska implemented new taxes and regulations for cruise lines, including a $50 head tax per passenger, corporate income tax, and fines for wastewater violations. The initiative aims to compensate for environmental harm and fund local communities and public services. Some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters in response, citing concerns about competitiveness for tourism. Opponents have filed a legal challenge to the tax in federal court. In response to new taxes and regulations for cruise lines in Alaska, some cruise ship lines have ceased operations in Alaskan waters due to concerns about tourism competitiveness. Opponents have filed a legal challenge to the tax in federal court. Other states have also taken action to regulate cruise ship discharges, such as Maine enacting legislation in 2004. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation governing discharges of graywater or mixed blackwater/graywater into coastal waters, applying to large cruise ships with overnight accommodations for 250 or more passengers. Ships must have advanced wastewater treatment systems, comply with discharge requirements, and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater dischargers were allowed if ships operated treatment systems conforming to Alaska federal and state laws. The legislation also required the state to apply for up to 50 No Discharge Zones from the EPA. Prior to 2006, graywater dischargers were allowed if ships operated treatment systems conforming to Alaska federal and state laws. Maine gained federal authorization to prohibit blackwater discharges into state waters. California enacted laws banning cruise ships from discharging treated wastewater, graywater, and operating waste incinerators. Additionally, California banned passenger ships from discharging sewage sludge and oil bilge water. California has enacted several laws to protect its waters, including bans on cruise ships releasing graywater, operating waste incinerators, discharging sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes. In 2006, California also passed a law requiring ballast water performance standards to prevent the spread of invasive species. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have similar agreements with the cruise industry. Several states, including Florida, Washington, and Hawaii, have agreements with the cruise industry to adhere to waste management practices. For example, in Florida, cruise lines must eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste off-loaded in the US annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the US Coast Guard. Under a 2001 agreement between industry and the state of Florida, cruise lines must eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste off-loaded in the US annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the US Coast Guard. Similarly, in April 2004, the Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum of understanding allowing treated wastewater discharge into state waters, with restrictions on untreated wastewater and sludge. Environmental advocates criticize these voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement and penalty provisions. The 2001 agreement in Florida requires cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections. In Washington, a 2004 MOU allows treated wastewater discharge into state waters with restrictions on untreated wastewater and sludge. Environmental advocates criticize these voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement and penalties. The state complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater during the 2008 sailing season. Wastewater treatment systems produce high-quality effluent, and the cruise ship industry has adopted waste management practices to protect water quality. The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) has implemented waste management practices for their operations, following regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA. Guidelines require proper discharge of graywater and blackwater, recycling of hazardous wastes, and implementation of Safety Management System (SMS) plans. The industry is also collaborating with manufacturers and regulators to develop technologies for lower emission turbine engines. Companies have implemented Safety Management System (SMS) plans for enhanced wastewater systems and increased auditing oversight, certified according to the IMO's International Safety Management Code. They are working with manufacturers and regulators to develop technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups appreciate the industry's improved practices but prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas. They announced conservation efforts in four areas to protect biodiversity in cruise destinations, including improving technology for wastewater management aboard cruise ships and educating vendors to lessen environmental impacts. CLIA and CI also developed a joint initiative to integrate sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts. In 2006, CLIA and CI announced a joint initiative to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect critical marine and coastal ecosystems. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofit all vessels in its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so completely. This move was in response to efforts by environmental group Oceana to protect the ocean environment and set an example for the cruise ship industry. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofit all vessels in its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so completely. The company's efforts to alter its practices following federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations were noted, with concerns about cruise ship pollution raising issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement. More assessment is needed to determine if current steps are adequate, and bringing these issues to national priority for resources is a challenge. The need for more assessment of existing conditions and whether current steps are adequate in addressing cruise ship pollution is a recent concern. There is a challenge in bringing these issues to national priority to obtain resources. Key questions include whether current laws and regulations adequately manage cruise ship pollution, or if legislative changes are necessary to fill gaps or strengthen requirements, particularly regarding graywater management. EPA's 2000 white paper highlighted gaps in coverage for certain waste streams on cruise ships. The EPA's 2000 white paper identified gaps in regulations for cruise ship waste streams, with graywater being a particular concern due to contamination issues. State officials found high levels of fecal coliform and other pollutants in cruise ship graywater. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clearer and uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from cruise ships. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including thorough recordkeeping, sampling, testing, and monitoring by vessel operators. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed similar concepts to address contamination issues in cruise ship graywater. The Clean Cruise Ship Act, introduced in Congress, aimed to amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting prescribed effluent limits. EPA and the Coast Guard would set strict effluent limits for these discharges. The Clean Cruise Ship Act aims to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting strict effluent limits. The legislation would also require cruise ships to treat wastewater and authorize federal enforcement measures, including inspection and sampling. Passenger fees would fund implementation by EPA and the Coast Guard. Environmental advocates support the legislation, while industry groups argue it unfairly targets a small percentage of ships globally.

Congress may need to develop federal legislation to harmonize state-level regulations on cruise ship discharges. Congress may need to develop federal legislation to harmonize state-level regulations on cruise ship discharges. EPA has been assessing the need for additional standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships, but has not yet proposed any rules. EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, examining various waste streams and discussing current federal actions. The EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, which examines various waste streams from cruise ships and discusses federal actions. The report identifies options to address cruise ship discharges but states that EPA has not determined their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority. Other issues include harmonizing U.S. laws on jurisdictional terms and defining \"cruise ship.\" The EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, which examines waste streams from cruise ships and discusses federal actions. Options to address cruise ship discharges are identified, but EPA has not determined their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority. Other issues include harmonizing U.S. laws on jurisdictional terms and defining \"cruise ship.\" Research is suggested to improve understanding of waste quantities, impacts of discharges, and potential control technologies. Research is needed to improve understanding of waste quantities, impacts of discharges, and potential control technologies for cruise ships. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in identifying the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritizing resources to address significant threats. Key research areas include transport of pollutants in the marine environment, impacts of stationary discharges from small passenger vessels, and disposal options for concentrated sludge from advanced sewage treatment on large passenger vessels. Research is needed to improve understanding of waste quantities, impacts of discharges, and potential control technologies for cruise ships. Key research areas include transport of pollutants in the marine environment, impacts of stationary discharges from small passenger vessels, disposal options for concentrated sludge from advanced sewage treatment on large passenger vessels, and the cumulative impacts of vessel pollution on sensitive ecosystems. EPA identified possible research options in the 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report, such as establishing a nationwide sampling program and increasing studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ship discharges. In the 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report, EPA identified research options to address air quality issues in ports and waterways impacted by cruise ship discharges. The report highlighted the need for monitoring discharges to evaluate current standards and management effectiveness, as existing laws and regulations may not be adequately enforced. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard and other agencies to monitor discharges, maintenance of pollution prevention equipment, and proper off-loading of garbage and oily sludge. Coast Guard's resources for enforcement are a key issue. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution, including monitoring off-loading of waste. Resource adequacy for vessel inspections has been a concern, especially with increased homeland security responsibilities. EPA suggests options for improving enforcement, such as enhancing monitoring and rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities. The Coast Guard's responsibilities for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution have been questioned, with suggestions for improving enforcement including enhancing monitoring, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, and charging a passenger fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. The process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries is also found to be ineffective, with recommendations for the Coast Guard to work with the IMO to encourage member countries to respond to pollution cases and to follow up on alleged pollution more diligently. The Coast Guard's enforcement of federal programs on cruise ship pollution has been criticized. Recommendations include improving monitoring, incentivizing passengers to report illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard engineers to monitor waste treatment. The process for referring violations to other countries is ineffective, with suggestions for the Coast Guard to work with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases and to follow up on alleged pollution cases outside U.S. jurisdiction."
