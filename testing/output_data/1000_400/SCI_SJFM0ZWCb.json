It utilizes an autoencoder for reduction and a novel clustering layer. Various similarity metrics are compared, and a visualization method generates heat maps of timeseries data. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated across diverse domains, outperforming traditional methods due to integrated temporal reduction and clustering criteria. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, aim to draw inferences from unlabeled data. While clustering has been successful with static data, applying it to time series data remains a challenge. This gap in technology hinders accurate unsupervised learning of time series data, which is crucial in various scientific fields. Clustering techniques for time series data face challenges due to variations in properties, temporal scales, and dimensionality. Real-world time series data often contain temporal gaps and high-frequency noise. Addressing these issues is crucial for accurate unsupervised learning in fields like financial trading and medical monitoring. The novel algorithm deep temporal clustering (DTC) addresses limitations of standard clustering techniques on time series data by transforming it into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network integrated with a temporal clustering layer. The DTC algorithm leverages informative features on all time scales to disentangle time series data. The DTC algorithm utilizes a deep autoencoder network with a temporal clustering layer to transform time series data into a low-dimensional latent space. It consists of three levels: a CNN to learn short-time-scale waveforms, a BI-LSTM to learn temporal connections across all time scales, and non-parametric clustering to uncover latent dimensions for data separation. The DTC algorithm uses a deep autoencoder network with three levels: a CNN to learn short-time-scale waveforms, a BI-LSTM to learn temporal connections across all time scales, and non-parametric clustering to uncover latent dimensions for data separation.

The study introduces an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, emphasizing effective latent representation and similarity metrics. DTC outperforms k-Shape BID15 and hierarchical clustering with complete linkage on real-world time series datasets by optimizing objectives separately. Existing research in temporal clustering methods focuses on dimensionality reduction and choosing a similarity metric, with some solutions using application-dependent reduction to filter out noise. However, drawbacks include potential loss of long-range correlations and filtering out relevant features. One drawback of approaches like BID11 and nonnegative matrix factorization BID4 is that dimensionality reduction is done independently of clustering criteria, potentially losing long-range correlations and relevant features. Another class of solutions focuses on creating a suitable similarity measure between time series by considering complexity, correlation, and time warping. These measures are then integrated into traditional clustering algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering. BID14's study highlighted the significant impact of similarity measures on results. BID14 conducted a study on various similarity metrics, emphasizing their impact on clustering results. While a good similarity measure is crucial, without proper dimensionality reduction, optimal clustering results may not be achieved due to the complexity of time series data. Transforming time series data into a low-dimensional latent space is effective for temporal clustering, but there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting an appropriate latent space. Compatibility of the similarity metric is also essential for meaningful clustering results. Recent studies have shown that casting time series data into a low-dimensional latent space is suitable for temporal clustering. However, there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting an effective latent space. Ensuring compatibility of the similarity metric with the temporal feature space is crucial for achieving meaningful clustering results. Recent studies have shown that casting time series data into a low-dimensional latent space is suitable for temporal clustering. A proposed Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) approach aims to perform unsupervised clustering of temporal sequences into clusters based on high-level features. The approach involves encoding the input signal into a latent space using a convolutional autoencoder and BI-LSTM, followed by a temporal clustering layer to generate cluster assignments. Effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering, achieved through a temporal autoencoder (TAE). The text discusses the use of a temporal autoencoder (TAE) to generate cluster assignments based on a latent representation obtained from a BI-LSTM. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for feature extraction and a Bidirectional LSTM for further processing. This dimensionality reduction is essential for improved performance in temporal clustering. The text describes the use of rectifying linear units (L-ReLUs) for dimensionality reduction in a temporal autoencoder (TAE) network. The first level compresses time series data while preserving relevant information, followed by a Bidirectional LSTM layer for learning temporal changes. The BI-LSTM latent representation is then used for clustering sequences, with learning driven by minimizing mean square error (MSE) for input sequence reconstruction. The text discusses the use of rectifying linear units (L-ReLUs) in a temporal autoencoder network for dimensionality reduction. The BI-LSTM layer is utilized for learning temporal changes and clustering sequences based on a clustering metric optimization. The learning process involves minimizing mean square error (MSE) for input sequence reconstruction and optimizing the clustering metric to separate sequences into distinct clusters. The clustering metric optimization in the network modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to separate input sequences into distinct clusters, disentangling spatio-temporal manifolds of dynamics efficiently. This approach contrasts traditional methods of dimensionality reduction. End-to-end optimization of the network efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for unsupervised categorization, outperforming traditional approaches that separately optimize reconstruction and clustering. This approach disentangles high-dimensional input dynamics, leading to improved separation of input sequences into distinct clusters. The approach of end-to-end optimization efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for unsupervised categorization, utilizing temporal continuity to encode informative features in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer consists of centroids initialized using latent signals obtained from the input data. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM utilizes the latent signals from input data to initialize centroids for hierarchical clustering, followed by unsupervised training to assign input data to clusters based on their latent representations. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM utilizes latent signals to initialize centroids for hierarchical clustering. An unsupervised algorithm is used to assign input data to clusters based on their latent representations by computing probability assignments and updating centroids using a loss function. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM uses latent signals to initialize centroids for hierarchical clustering. Input data is assigned to clusters based on their latent representations by computing probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. The parameter \u03b1 determines the degrees of freedom, with \u03b1 = 1 in an unsupervised setting. The temporal similarity metric siml() is used to compute distances between the encoded signal and centroids. In an unsupervised setting, the parameter \u03b1 is set to 1 for the Students t distribution. The temporal similarity metric siml() calculates distances between the encoded signal and centroids. Various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) which uses the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation. Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2 computes similarity based on euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation. The distance is calculated using a complexity factor defined as min(CE(x), CE(y)), where CE(x) and CE(y) are complexity estimates of time series x and y. The core idea is that as complexity differences increase, the distance increases. If both sequences have the same complexity, the distance is simply the euclidean distance. The complexity of sequences is defined using different similarity measures: Euclidean distance, Correlation based Similarity (COR), and Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF). COR computes similarities using Pearson's correlation, while ACF uses autocorrelation coefficients. The objective is to minimize KL divergence loss in training the temporal clustering layer. The text discusses training the temporal clustering layer by minimizing KL divergence loss between q ij and a target distribution p ij, which is crucial for strengthening high confidence predictions and normalizing losses. This is achieved using autocorrelation coefficients and weighted euclidean distance between centroids. The KL divergence loss is computed using the target distribution, and joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder is performed by minimizing this loss. The text discusses the joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder by minimizing KL divergence loss and mean squared error loss. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is crucial, achieved by pretraining autoencoder parameters and initializing cluster centers through hierarchical clustering. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are updated using gradients. The text discusses the joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder by minimizing KL divergence loss and mean squared error loss. Initial centroids are pre-trained to ensure a meaningful latent representation, and cluster centers are initialized through hierarchical clustering. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are updated using gradients, preventing problematic solutions from drifting too far from the original input signal. The latent representation converges to minimize both clustering and MSE loss. The text discusses using a heatmap-generating network to localize main data features for classification, following the joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder to minimize clustering and MSE loss. The text describes using cluster labels from a DTC network to train a hierarchical convolutional network for classifying inputs and generating heatmaps to show relevant parts of the inputs. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on real data, with higher heatmap values indicating event localization. The study evaluates the performance of a DTC algorithm on various real-world datasets, including UCR Time series Classification Archive datasets and spacecraft magnetometer data from the NASA MMS Mission. Heatmaps generated by the algorithm correctly mark the time location of events, with higher values indicating event localization.
