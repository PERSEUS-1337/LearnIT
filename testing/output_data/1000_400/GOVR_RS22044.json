    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring states to offer a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to all such children. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of disabled children in private schools, with benefits comparable to those in public schools. Prior to P.L. 105-17, regulations required local education agencies to provide equitable participation in program benefits for private school students, with benefits comparable to those in public schools. The vague statute led to differences among states and courts regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a provision for children with disabilities in private schools to receive special education and related services. The Supreme Court had conflicting views on this issue before Congress revised the law. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a provision for children with disabilities in private schools to receive special education and related services, including on the premises of private schools. The 2004 reauthorization made further changes to these provisions, ensuring that children with disabilities enrolled in private schools, including parochial schools, are identified and provided with necessary services. The 2004 reauthorization of the IDEA made changes to provisions ensuring children with disabilities in private schools, including parochial schools, receive necessary services. The intent was to clarify responsibilities of local educational agencies to provide fair and equitable services to these children. The 2004 reauthorization of the IDEA clarified responsibilities of local educational agencies to provide services to children with disabilities in private schools, either through placement by the agency or parents. The cost of private school placement is covered by the agency unless certain findings are made. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified that children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by either the agency or parents. The cost is covered by the agency unless specific findings are made. IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if placed there unilaterally by parents. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified that children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by either the agency or parents. Children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents are entitled to special education and related services, with the requirement that they be located in the school district served by the LEA. This change was made to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools across district lines. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified that children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by either the agency or parents, with the requirement that they be located in the school district served by the LEA. This change aimed to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools across district lines, but has generated controversy due to issues like disproportional effects on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified that children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by either the agency or parents within the school district served by the LEA. This change aimed to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools across district lines, but has raised concerns about funding formula changes, conflicts with state laws, and requirements for children parentally placed in private schools. The Senate report emphasized the importance of providing direct services to such children rather than solely focusing on indirect services.

The Senate report emphasized the importance of providing direct services to such children rather than solely focusing on indirect services. The new provision added a calculation for the proportionate amount, requiring thorough child find processes for parentally placed children with disabilities in private schools. Services may be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools, to the extent consistent with the law. The final regulations under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA address services for children with disabilities in private schools, including a discussion on proportionate share calculation. The new law maintains the provision for services at private, including religious schools, and adds a requirement for supplementing funds, not supplanting them.

Provisions are added for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. Child find is designed to ensure the accurate count of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. The cost of child find activities cannot be used to meet the LEA's spending obligation. Child find for private school children with disabilities must be completed in a timeframe similar to public school students. LEA consultation with private school officials and parents of private school children with disabilities is required, including in the child find process.

The new law under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of children with disabilities on how special education services will be provided, including types of services, apportionment of funds, and decision-making processes. LEAs must also provide written explanations if services are not provided. The new law under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA mandates LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of children with disabilities on providing special education services, including fund allocation and decision-making processes. Private school representatives must sign a written affirmation of the consultation, and compliance procedures are outlined in P.L. 108-446. Private school officials have the right to file a complaint with the SEA if they believe the LEA did not engage in meaningful and timely consultation.

Reimbursement for private school placement costs may be reduced or denied if certain notice requirements are not met, but exceptions exist in cases where the parent was prevented from providing notice, was unaware of the requirement, or if compliance would harm the child. The new law on special education services for private school pupils states that reimbursement for placement costs may not be reduced or denied if the parent was prevented from providing notice, unaware of the requirement, or if compliance would harm the child. The law also allows for exceptions if the parent is illiterate, cannot write in English, or if compliance would result in serious emotional harm to the child. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement, even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for lower courts. In Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F., the Court upheld an appeals court ruling that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement, even if the student never received special education services from the school district. The Supreme Court's decision does not set a precedent for lower courts."
