It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues involving the Jones Act include debates on Puerto Rico's economy, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires vessels transporting cargo between U.S. points to be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It has been a topic of debate in recent Congresses due to issues such as Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and discussions on domestic oil transportation. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals and efforts to enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability have also been under scrutiny. The Jones Act of 1920 requires U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport. Laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet date back to the First Congress in 1789. The Office of Management and Budget sought public input on reducing regulatory burdens in the maritime sector in May 2018. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport. Laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet were established by the First Congress in 1789, with restrictions on foreign-owned vessels transporting domestic cargo. The early United States had a shipbuilding advantage due to abundant timber resources, but lost it as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships in the late 1800s. In the late 1800s, the United States lost its shipbuilding advantage as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships, with the advantage shifting to Scotland and England. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. foreign trade carried by U.S. vessels, leading to the \"free ship\" movement allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag. Opponents argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews would hinder the resurgence of trade carried by U.S. vessels. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress considered but did not pass bills allowing foreign-built ships in domestic trade, tightening language on coastwise transport instead. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress considered bills allowing foreign-built ships in domestic trade but tightened language on coastwise transport instead. In 1891, a shipper loaded goods on a foreign-flag ship to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, leading to lower freight charges despite a circuitous route. In the late 1800s, a shipper loaded goods on a foreign-flag ship bound for Antwerp, Belgium, then transferred to another ship bound for Los Angeles to save on freight charges. Congress later amended laws to prohibit routing cargo through foreign ports to avoid coastwise laws. Despite this, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. In 1898, laws were amended to prohibit shippers from routing cargo through foreign ports to avoid coastwise laws. U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 amended coastwise language to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle. The Jones Act aimed to address the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to address the cost difference between building ships in the United States and foreign countries. The act required Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle, prohibiting shippers from using foreign-flag vessels to avoid coastwise laws. The debate leading up to the passage of the Jones Act included concerns about the cost of building ships domestically versus acquiring foreign-built ships. To sustain the American merchant marine, it is crucial to remove restrictions on American merchants acquiring ships at competitive prices from both domestic and foreign sources. Allowing merchants to buy ships in the global market and register them under the American flag will promote competitiveness. Conversely, limiting ship purchases to American builders for domestic trade will result in higher prices. The cost of U.S.-built ships has consistently been higher compared to foreign-built ships over the years. A 1922 report showed a 20% cost difference, which increased to 50% in the 1930s, doubled in the 1950s, and tripled by the 1990s. Currently, a U.S.-built tanker is estimated to cost four times more than a global price, while a U.S.-built container ship may cost five times more. The cost of U.S.-built ships has consistently been higher compared to foreign-built ships over the years. In the 1930s, the cost differential increased to 50%, doubled in the 1950s, and tripled by the 1990s. Today, a U.S.-built tanker is estimated to cost four times the global price, while a U.S.-built container ship may cost five times more. The Department of Defense has found building sealift ships domestically unaffordable and will instead buy more used foreign-built cargo ships. U.S. shipyards do not compete with foreign shipyards on price or vessel characteristics. The military has decided to buy more used foreign-built cargo ships instead of building sealift ships domestically due to cost concerns. U.S. shipyards do not compete with foreign shipyards on price or vessel characteristics, leading to higher operating costs for U.S.-flag ships compared to foreign-flag ships. This cost difference includes crewing, insurance, and maintenance costs, with estimates showing a significant increase since 2010. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 also addressed these cost differentials. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and stated maritime policy goals for national defense and commerce. The act emphasized the need for a well-equipped merchant marine to carry the majority of the country's commerce. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the importance of a well-equipped merchant marine for national defense and commerce. It declared the policy of the United States to develop and maintain a merchant marine owned and operated by U.S. citizens. This reflected the country's emerging power status at the time. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the need for the United States to develop and maintain its own merchant marine to avoid dependency on other nations' vessels. The Jones Act applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring a majority of the crew to be U.S. citizens. The Jones Act applies to domestic waterborne shipments, with U.S. citizen crewing requirements. Certain U.S. territories are exempt from the Act, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between them and other U.S. points. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement for vessels. Ships transporting cargo between U.S. points must meet U.S.-owned and -crewed requirements. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing regulations for vessels. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the Jones Act. The Jones Act, also known as \"coastwise qualified,\" requires using U.S.-built vessels for transportation between U.S. points. The Coast Guard determines if a vessel is U.S.-built based on specific criteria. Competing freight transportation modes do not have the same requirement. The Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-built vessels for transportation between U.S. points. The Coast Guard defines a U.S.-built vessel as one with major components of its hull and superstructure fabricated in the U.S. Propulsion machinery and other equipment do not impact this determination, allowing for the import of engines for oceangoing ships. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull, not integral parts of the hull's structure. Parts or components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity can be manufactured abroad but must be attached in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard allows up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be manufactured abroad. The Coast Guard allows certain components of a vessel's hull to be manufactured abroad, as long as they do not exceed 1.5% of the steel weight. Components like propellers, stern bulbs, and watertight closures can be imported, but any custom shaping or cutting of steel must be done in a U.S. shipyard. Shipyards often seek confirmation from the Coast Guard before incorporating foreign-built components. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign-built components in vessel construction, with a 1.5% steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard for incorporating these components. Determination letters detail permissible foreign components. Shipyard unions call vessels built this way \"kit ships.\" In 2007, unions sued the Coast Guard over interpretation of the statute. In 2007, shipyard unions sued the Coast Guard over the interpretation of the statute regarding permissible foreign components in vessel construction. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sided with the Coast Guard, citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. The lawsuit stemmed from a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers using the Korean builder's designs and procurement services. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by a Philadelphia shipyard's partnership with a South Korean shipbuilder, begun in 2004, to use the Korean builder's ship designs and procurement services to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act carriers, potentially undermining the Jones Act policy objective of domestic shipbuilding independence. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by partnerships with South Korean shipbuilders to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act carriers, potentially undermining the policy objective of domestic shipbuilding independence. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to CBP regulations. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships. CBP regulations allow non-Jones Act compliant cruise ships to serve U.S. ports if they visit distant foreign ports. This regulatory interpretation dates back to a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service. In 1985, the U.S. Customs Service allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to make round trips from U.S. ports as long as they visit a nearby foreign port. The primary intent of the voyage must not be domestic transportation to avoid violating the Jones Act. This rule permits cruise ships to visit other U.S. ports if they include a stop at a foreign port like Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the original dock. The Jones Act is not violated if the main purpose of a cruise voyage is not domestic transportation of passengers. \"Voyages to nowhere\" involve visits to no other ports, staying within 3-mile zone of U.S. territorial waters to be Jones Act-compliant. If the vessel journeys beyond 3 miles into international waters, it does not need to be Jones Act compliant. CBP interprets the Jones Act to require vessels within 3 miles of U.S. waters to be compliant. If vessels go beyond 3 miles, they do not need to comply. However, charter fishing boats must still comply even in international waters. CBP also defines a passenger for Jones Act compliance. In international waters, vessels must be Jones Act-compliant according to CBP's interpretation. A passenger is defined as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member or owner, including business clients on a yacht or construction workers on a construction site. This interpretation also affects the offshore oil market. The Jones Act applies to vessels in international waters, impacting activities such as lightering and offshore supply in the oil market. CBP's interpretation requires compliance for vessels within 3 nautical miles of shore, affecting operations in areas like the Gulf of Mexico and the Delaware Bay. Lightering vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and Delaware Bay must be Jones Act-compliant within 3 nautical miles of shore. Offshore supply vessels servicing oil rigs must also adhere to Jones Act regulations within the 200-mile zone defined by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, U.S. waters extend 200 miles offshore for offshore natural resource activities. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points,\" while mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed are not. Congress mandated in 2008 that U.S.-owned and -crewed vessels service these units, but they do not need to be U.S.-built. In 2008, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. The Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies/workers or installing equipment for oil rigs. Vessels laying cable/pipeline in U.S. waters are exempt from Jones Act requirements. The Jones Act compliance for vessels depends on their activities, with exemptions for vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters. There is uncertainty regarding the application of the Jones Act to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore, with guidance from CBP's interpretations. The CBP proposed that most activities by OSVs fall under the Jones Act in 2017, but withdrew the proposal after reviewing comments. Questions remain about the Jones Act's application to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) hinders offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper waters. U.S. wind developers either transport equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels from U.S. ports. The Jones Act's impact on offshore wind farm development is significant, especially in deeper waters. In Europe, Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) not only install towers but also transport equipment from shore to offshore sites. U.S. wind developers face challenges as there are no Jones Act-compliant TIVs, leading to the use of non-compliant vessels alongside compliant ones for equipment transportation. Additionally, a CBP interpretation allows for non-compliant vessels if merchandise is transformed at an intermediate foreign port. The Jones Act allows for non-compliant vessels to transport merchandise if it is transformed into a new product at an intermediate foreign port. This exemption has precedent in a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice. The Jones Act has provisions that tighten requirements and exempt certain maritime activities. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels from being sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag, preventing them from being used in U.S. domestic trade again. In 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel (P.L. 100-329). Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act when no qualified operator is available, such as for passenger travel between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports (P.L. 98-563). In 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports if no Jones Act-qualified operator was available. This exemption allows foreign-flag cruise ships to transport passengers between the U.S. mainland and the island. Congress has also permitted foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in 1996 and 2011 due to the lack of Jones Act-qualified vessels. Additionally, exemptions have been enacted to address sudden spikes in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels, such as an exemption for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes. In 1996, Congress enacted exemptions for LNG tankers to provide domestic service due to a lack of Jones Act-qualified vessels. Congress has also granted waivers for vessel shortages during spikes in demand, such as for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes in the 1940s and a bumper grain harvest in 1951. Additionally, exemptions were made for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations when there weren't enough Jones Act-qualified vessels available. In 1971 and 1965, Congress enacted Jones Act waivers for vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs, exempting specific barges and empty containers from the Jones Act to allow foreign-flagged carriers to reposition their equipment along U.S. coastlines. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their equipment along U.S. coastlines for international shipments. This exemption has implications for the development of marine highways and short sea shipping routes, as transshipment of loaded international containers requires Jones Act-compliant ships. The lack of transshipment services in the United States increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of international containerized cargo, which is not common in the United States. Congress has authorized exemptions for specific vessels without detailed descriptions. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 specific vessels in 16 separate legislative acts, typically appearing in maritime-related legislation. These waivers do not specify the reason for the waiver or details about the vessels, but most are not commercially significant and may be owned by nonprofit entities. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to numerous vessels in various legislative acts. These waivers are often for vessels that are not commercially significant and may be owned by nonprofit entities. Some waivers are granted due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, with specific conditions placed on the vessel's use. Domestic shipping restrictions were waived during World War I and World War II, and in 1950 after the Korean War began. The Jones Act requirements have been waived for various reasons, including national defense interests during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Libya. Waivers have also been granted for fuel resupply after natural disasters. In 1991 and 2011, waivers were granted on national defense grounds to expedite oil shipments from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the Persian Gulf War and a conflict in Libya. The executive branch has also waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters, with recent waivers granted after major hurricanes. Congress inserted a role for MARAD to check on the availability of Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting certain waivers in 2008. In 2008, Congress gave MARAD a role to ensure Jones Act-qualified vessels were available before granting waivers. Waivers have been granted for national defense reasons, such as in 2005 and 2006 for heavy-lift vessels. In 1992, a waiver request to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships was denied. In 1992, Customs denied a waiver request to use a foreign-flag heavy-lift vessel to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships from Boston to San Francisco, citing national defense reasons. CBP has not issued waivers for economic reasons like commercial practicality or expediency, even after safety concerns were raised by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. CBP has not issued national defense waivers for economic reasons such as commercial practicality or expediency. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands for national security reasons. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. The United States exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. The U.S. has begun exporting LNG by ship while continuing to import LNG by ship, but no LNG is shipped domestically on Jones Act tankers. The United States exports crude oil on foreign-flag tankers and imports from overseas sources, while domestically shipping on Jones Act tankers. Similar trends are seen with LNG, with the U.S. exporting but not domestically shipping LNG on Jones Act tankers. Puerto Rico seeks a Jones Act waiver for LNG shipments. Recent controversies involve oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. The Jones Act also applies to ships on the Great Lakes and various passenger vessels. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, including oceangoing ships, tankers, and dry cargo ships. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, with the largest category being tankers. The fleet employs about 3,380 mariners, with tankers carrying Alaskan crude oil to the West Coast and refined products along the Atlantic Coast. The Jones Act fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, with tankers being the largest category. There are 57 tankers in total, carrying Alaskan crude oil to the West Coast and refined products along the Atlantic Coast. The fleet also includes dry cargo ships such as container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk vessels. The number of oceangoing ships in the fleet has decreased significantly since 1950, with a decrease in aggregate carrying capacity as well. The Jones Act fleet has shrunk to less than a quarter of its 1950 size, with a drop in fleet size in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The U.S. merchant marine was criticized in a 1967 congressional hearing for being \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act. The Jones Act fleet has declined significantly since the 1950s, with the U.S. merchant marine criticized for being \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration was the only one to call for the repeal of the Jones Act, despite domestic ships losing market share to railroads and pipelines. Despite economic advantages, ships have fallen behind in carrying freight compared to land modes. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where shippers have limited alternatives, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Despite preserving a nucleus of the U.S. maritime industry, it has not met the goal of increasing the nation's commerce carried by the merchant marine. Congress amended the policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to address this issue. The Jones Act has not succeeded in meeting the policy goal of sustaining a growing merchant marine that carries an increasing proportion of the nation's commerce. The fleet does not achieve the goals of providing shipping service on all essential routes and having the best equipped vessels. Not all ship designs are represented in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet does not achieve the goals of providing shipping service on all essential routes and having the best equipped vessels. \"Project cargo\" vessels, like heavy-lift vessels, are not present in the Jones Act fleet, leading to the use of waivers for moving specialized equipment. The Jones Act fleet faces challenges in competing for international shipments due to higher cost structures. Two dry bulk ships in the fleet are mostly inactive, possibly due to their age, while the sole Jones Act-qualified chemical tanker was built in 1968. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, there are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet is facing challenges due to higher costs and aging ships. The lack of LNG tankers in the fleet, along with limited tanker capacity for shale oil production, led to pressure for lifting the crude oil export ban in 2015. To address the high cost of U.S.-built ships, a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB) has been developed, with over 150 ATBs operating in the Jones Act trades. ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges in handling sea swells but still less capable than ships in heavy sea states. The U.S. market has developed a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB), with over 150 ATBs operating in the Jones Act trades. ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges in handling sea swells but less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. They pose a higher risk of grounding and provide less time to prevent spilled oil from reaching shorelines. ATBs now carry more cargo, predominantly oil, on coastal voyages than the tanker fleet. ATBs sail closer to coasts, posing a higher risk of grounding and less time to prevent spilled oil reaching shorelines. ATB crews lack qualifications to sail sealift ships. El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship, sank in 2015 due to having open lifeboats instead of closed ones with auto launchers. Coast Guard expressed concern about U.S.-flag fleet condition after El Faro incident. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet after the El Faro incident, noting that other vessels in the fleet are also in substandard condition. In February 2019, the crew of the Jones Act containership Matsonia found a crack in the hull, highlighting the fleet's aging infrastructure. The Jones Act fleet is relatively young due to recent shipbuilding efforts to comply with emissions regulations. About one-third of oceangoing vessels are over 21 years old, down from two-thirds in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet, however, is considerably older. The Jones Act oceangoing fleet has reduced the number of ships over 21 years old to one-third, down from two-thirds in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet, consisting of older vessels carrying iron ore, limestone, and coal, includes 1,000-foot freighters built between 1972 and 1981 and 700-foot ships from the 1940s and 1950s. Ships in freshwater like the Great Lakes can have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Great Lakes fleet consists of older vessels, with some ships built in the 1940s and 1950s, and others built between 1972 and 1981. These ships are narrower due to the dimensions of the Soo Locks in Michigan. Domestic tonnage on the Great Lakes has decreased since the 1950s, while the Canadian fleet has older ships, with the youngest built in 1985 before Canada imposed a tariff on imported ships. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet has declined steadily since the 1950s, with the youngest ship built in 1985 before Canada imposed a 25% tariff on imported ships. After repealing the tariff in 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been constructed in other countries for service on the Great Lakes. Thousands of tugs and barges carry dry and liquid bulk commodities on the nation's inland rivers. The U.S. inland river fleet consists of thousands of tugs and barges carrying dry and liquid bulk commodities, including corn, soybeans, and coal. Overall tonnage has been flat or slightly declining since 1990. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. In 1988, the Jones Act was amended to include valueless material as \"merchandise\" transported domestically by vessel, impacting dredge spoil transportation. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators increases the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators significantly raises the cost of dredging U.S. harbors. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged. Factors contributing to cost increases include limited supply of dredging vessels, higher fuel and steel costs, labor expenses, and stricter environmental regulations. Compared to leading European dredging firms, the U.S. privately owned fleet is older, smaller, and less efficient. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. European firms have larger hopper dredges, with three to four times the capacity of the entire U.S. hopper fleet. Most U.S. hopper dredges are over 20 years old, while European fleet is younger. One of the four U.S. firms is often the sole bidder for Army Corps harbor work. Insufficient dredges can perform scheduled projects due to limited availability. The U.S. dredging fleet is older compared to European firms, with over 20 years of age. One of the four U.S. firms is frequently the sole bidder for Army Corps harbor work. Insufficient dredges are available for scheduled projects. Mobilization and demobilization costs can make up over one-third of total project costs in the U.S. market. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels to transport their dredge fleets, which are not available in the Jones Act fleet. The offshore supply vessel fleet, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, consisted of about 1,800 vessels in 2017. The offshore supply vessel fleet in the Gulf of Mexico consisted of about 1,800 vessels in 2017. Foreign-built vessels are relied upon for construction of rigs in deeper waters due to the lack of dynamic positioning propulsion systems in the Jones Act fleet. This poses challenges for installing wind towers in deeper waters as well. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems for construction work in deep waters. This also raises concerns about the fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency. Congress has enacted programs to designate other fleets for sealift support, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool may hinder crewing a reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act mariners crewing oceangoing ships are crucial for supporting military sealift operations. With a total of 3,380 merchant mariners, they make up 29% of the mariner pool available to crew the Ready Reserve Force for military sealift purposes. Congress directed the development of a national sealift strategy in 2014, but it has yet to be issued. The shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about the ability to crew a reserve sealift fleet effectively. Jones Act mariners have six months of shore leave per year and crew a reserve fleet of government-owned cargo ships for military sealift purposes. They make up 29% of the total mariner pool needed for this task, with the rest coming from privately owned international fleets and the Military Sealift Command fleet. MARAD believes there are enough commercial mariners to crew the reserve sealift fleet. The U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet enrolled in the Maritime Security Program (MSP) consists of 60 ships and 2,386 commercial mariners, while the Military Sealift Command (MSC) fleet of government-owned ships has about 120 ships and 5,576 mariners. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for a prolonged sealift effort lasting more than 180 days. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger. The U.S. mariner pool has consistently been insufficient for prolonged sealift efforts, as highlighted by findings from previous decades. Despite efforts to address this issue, including the establishment of the RRF, MSC, and MSP fleets, there remains a shortage of mariners for extended sealift operations. The U.S. mariner pool is insufficient for prolonged sealift efforts, despite the establishment of the RRF, MSC, and MSP fleets. The RRF consists of 46 ships with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, needing an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. MSC ships are controlled by TRANSCOM and mostly crewed by civilian mariners, while MSP ships are a fleet established by Congress. The MSP fleet, established by Congress in 1996, receives an operating subsidy of about $5 million per vessel per year to cover the additional cost of American crews. The military is to utilize MSP ships before MSC ships, as per agreements between MARAD and the Department of Defense. Jones Act operators are required to purchase more costly U.S.-built ships for military sealift operations. The military is required to utilize MSP ships before MSC ships under the cargo preference law. Jones Act operators must buy expensive U.S.-built ships, while the military sealift fleet mainly consists of cheaper foreign-built ships. There is a proposal to have the sealift fleet built domestically, with the higher cost shared nationally. This would make coastwise ships more competitive and increase the mariner pool for sealift operations. The proposal is to build the sealift fleet domestically, with the higher cost shared nationally. This would increase competitiveness of coastwise ships, expand the mariner pool, and allow for ships designed to military specifications for flexible capabilities. The military seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, including ramps or onboard cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports. The majority of the military sealift fleet consists of product tankers and roll-on/roll-off ships. The preference for versatility conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost efficiency. General cargo and break-bulk ships have been largely replaced by container ships. The commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost efficiency conflicts with the military's preference for versatile cargo ships with ramps or onboard cranes. General cargo and break-bulk ships have been replaced by container ships, leading to a lack of experience in operating cargo cranes for commercial mariners. Additionally, the largest container ships require more depth than many ports can provide, and Ro/Ro ships have been replaced by \"pure car carriers\" that may be less useful for military purposes due to cost pressures. The largest container ships require deeper water than many ports can provide, leading to a disparity between military and commercial vessel designs. Cost pressures have influenced commercial carriers to prioritize fuel-efficient engines that may not meet military speed requirements. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have prompted the use of LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers, impacting cargo space and crew skill sets. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 aims to maintain a shipyard industrial base with the ability to build and repair ships, but U.S. shipyards face challenges due to low production rates and lack of economies of scale. The objective of U.S. maritime policy is to have a merchant marine with efficient shipbuilding and repair facilities. U.S. shipyards face challenges with low production rates and lack of economies of scale, with only a few oceangoing ships built per year and gaps between orders. One shipyard had no vessels under construction or on order as of March 31, 2019, while another relies heavily on Navy orders. Smaller vessels like tour boats, ferries, and barges are also built domestically, with around 1,000 barges constructed in a typical year. The government-owned sealift fleet, averaging 44 years old, lacks sufficient large dry docks for repairs, delaying readiness to sail. Some reserve fleet ships have failed safety inspections due to rusted hulls, with one ship found to have a hole while sailing to an exercise. The Maritime Administrator reports an insufficient number of large dry docks for servicing the sealift fleet, leading to delays in readiness to sail. Some reserve fleet ships have failed safety inspections due to rusted hulls, with one ship found to have a hole while sailing to an exercise. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the fleet includes building new vessels, repairing current ships, and purchasing used foreign-built ships due to cost and time constraints. Repairing vessels has been three times more expensive and taken twice as long as projected, prompting consideration of accelerating the purchase of used ships. The Navy is considering accelerating the purchase of used, foreign-built ships due to the high cost and time constraints of repairing vessels. Building new ships in U.S. yards is 26 times more expensive and not affordable. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships still opt for foreign repairs due to lower costs."
