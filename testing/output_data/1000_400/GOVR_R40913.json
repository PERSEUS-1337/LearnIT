    "content": "The United States has historically relied on domestic natural resources for energy needs, but growing industrialization and population led to increased dependence on foreign energy sources in the 20th century. Federal efforts have since focused on increasing energy independence, reducing domestic consumption, and developing renewable energy sources through various programs established over the past 40 years. Federal efforts to increase U.S. energy independence and reduce domestic consumption have led to the establishment of programs focused on energy efficiency, conservation of resources, and research for renewable energy sources. These programs have been redesigned periodically to meet changing economic conditions and national interests, applying broadly across sectors. Congress has enacted major energy laws since 2005 to address current needs and future challenges. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws to establish, expand, or modify energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Treasury, and Department of Agriculture (USDA) operate various incentive programs across different sectors. Since 2005, Congress has enacted laws (P.L. 111-5) to support energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) administers the most programs, with others run by the Department of the Treasury, Department of Agriculture (USDA), and several other agencies. These programs provide grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy research and development. The curr_chunk outlines federal programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. Programs are grouped by administering agency with references to federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes, with budgetary figures compiled from various sources. For more information on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416. The curr_chunk provides information on federal programs for renewable energy and energy efficiency, with budget figures from executive agency justifications and congressional reports. For more details on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416. Additionally, information on alternative fuels and vehicle technology programs can be found in CRS Report R42566. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are covered in detail in the same report. The curr_chunk provides a summary of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives and programs, including details on various initiatives such as Clean Renewable Energy Bonds and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program. Expired Federal Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Incentive Programs include various initiatives such as Assisted Housing Stability and Energy Program, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program, and Renewable Energy Grants."
