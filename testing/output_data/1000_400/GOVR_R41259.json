    "content": "North Korea's development of prohibited weapons and illicit activities has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy since the post-Cold War era. The U.S. has never had formal diplomatic relations with North Korea and has attempted negotiations, aid, and sanctions to halt their weapons programs without success. U.S. interests in North Korea include security, political, and human rights concerns due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan. The U.S. has tried negotiations, aid, and sanctions to stop North Korea's weapons programs, but they continue to advance. U.S. interests in North Korea involve security, political, and human rights concerns due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan. The presence of U.S. troops and civilians in the region puts them at risk of a North Korean attack, which could have severe global economic implications. North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. homeland, with potential implications for the global economy. Negotiations surrounding North Korea's weapons program impact U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea. Dealing with North Korea's totalitarian regime, founded on the philosophy of juche, presents challenges due to its resistance to outside influences. North Korea, with a totalitarian regime founded on the philosophy of juche, has resisted outside influences to maintain near-totalitarian control. The regime has built one of the world's largest militaries, acting as a deterrent and providing leverage to extract concessions from foreign powers. North Korea, a small country surrounded by more powerful neighbors, has built one of the world's largest militaries over the past 70 years. This militarization acts as a deterrent to outside intervention and gives Pyongyang leverage over foreign powers, allowing the regime to extract concessions. However, this militarization, combined with provocative behavior and opaque policymaking, has hindered North Korea's economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening, most of the population remains impoverished, and increased access to outside information could lead to discontent with the regime. Despite Kim's solid hold on power and signs of economic strengthening in North Korea, the internal situation remains difficult with widespread poverty. Increased access to outside information could lead to public discontent with the regime. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea, including authorizing funds for aid and holding hearings on various issues such as human rights, sanctions evasion, and denuclearization steps. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea, including authorizing funds for aid and holding hearings on various issues such as human rights, sanctions evasion, and denuclearization steps. Recent advancements in North Korea's missile and nuclear capabilities have heightened the regime's threat to the United States, making it a top-line foreign policy and national security concern. North Korea's recent advancements in missile and nuclear capabilities pose a significant threat to the United States. The regime has demonstrated the ability to strike the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, surpassing other security concerns in the first 18 months of the Trump Administration. Pyongyang's threats span across various domains including nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, submarine-based missiles, artillery, and cyberattacks. Multiple nuclear tests and missile launches in 2016 and 2017 have raised concerns about North Korea's capabilities. North Korea's advancements in missile and nuclear capabilities pose a significant threat to the United States. The regime conducted multiple nuclear tests and missile launches between 2016 and 2017, demonstrating the ability to strike the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. Additionally, North Korea is developing its submarine-based ballistic missile program and has shown the capability to use cyberattacks, as seen in the \"WannaCry\" incident in 2017. The Trump Administration initially responded with a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures. North Korea was blamed for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack that disrupted global computer networks. The Trump Administration implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to pressure Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic means. This included increasing economic pressure, urging China and others to apply more pressure, and strengthening alliances with South Korea and Japan. The Administration successfully pushed for four new sanctions resolutions at the United Nations Security Council. The Trump Administration implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to pressure North Korea through economic and diplomatic means. This included urging China and others to apply more pressure, expanding the capabilities of U.S. alliances, and leading the United Nations Security Council to pass four new sanctions resolutions. The Administration also emphasized the option of launching a preventive military strike against North Korea. The Trump Administration implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to pressure North Korea through economic and diplomatic means, urging global partners to cut ties with North Korea. There were contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a preventive military strike. North Korea accepted an invitation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to confusion about U.S. policy. In early 2018, North Korea accepted an invitation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations. This paved the way for a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in Singapore. Kim met with Moon and Xi Jinping before the summit, launching a \"charm offensive\" after previous provocations. Kim Jong-un, who had not met with a foreign leader or left North Korea since taking power, engaged in diplomacy by meeting with Moon and Xi Jinping before the historic U.S.-DPRK summit. Factors such as Trump's military threats, sanctions, Moon's outreach, and Kim's nuclear deterrent likely influenced his decision. Kim Jong-un engaged in diplomacy by meeting with Moon and Xi Jinping before the historic U.S.-DPRK summit. Factors like Trump's military threats, sanctions, Moon's outreach, and Kim's nuclear deterrent likely influenced his decision. President Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and the future of U.S. relations with North Korea. The Singapore document is shorter on details than previous nuclear agreements with North Korea. The Singapore summit between Trump and Kim resulted in a brief joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The agreement focused on normalization, peace, denuclearization, and recovering POW/MIA remains, with no mention of North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations were planned. The Singapore summit between Trump and Kim resulted in a joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The agreement also included plans to recover POW/MIA remains. Trump announced the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises and expressed a desire to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. Follow-on negotiations were planned. After the Singapore summit, Trump called off \"war games\" and expressed a desire to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, citing cost savings. The cancellation of the U.S.-South Korea \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises was announced the following week. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, but critics highlighted the lack of a timeframe and verification mechanisms for denuclearization. Critics of the agreement with North Korea point out the lack of a timeframe or verification mechanisms for denuclearization, as well as Kim's commitment to dismantle the ballistic missile program. Uncertainty remains regarding denuclearization, sequencing, peace regime, and diplomatic ties. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Some analysts believe North Korea's attempt to secure a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a ploy to stall for time and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Concerns exist about the regime's intentions to delay the process and ease sanctions pressure. Implementing existing sanctions is challenging amidst engagement efforts, with U.N. sanctions being a crucial tool to hold North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. The United Nations sanctions on North Korea, led by the United States, have been a key tool in imposing costs on the regime for its weapons programs. A total of 10 resolutions were adopted between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for member states to halt interactions with North Korea related to military, diplomatic, and economic activities. The United Nations sanctions on North Korea, led by the United States, have expanded requirements for member states to halt interactions related to military, diplomatic, and economic activities with the DPRK. Since 2016, six resolutions have been adopted, banning financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and interactions with North Korea and North Koreans. Since 2016, six UN sanctions resolutions have been adopted, expanding to ban financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and interactions with North Korea. This has led to a significant decline in North Korean exports in 2017. The Obama and Trump Administrations also pushed countries to cut ties with North Korea. The value of North Korean exports in 2017 declined by over 30% compared to 2016. The US administrations urged countries globally to cut ties with North Korea, going beyond UNSC requirements. It is uncertain if the Trump Administration has continued this approach after starting diplomatic outreach in 2018. The US imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, with Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump issuing executive orders targeting the country. The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, in addition to leading the effort in the UNSC. Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump issued executive orders targeting North Korea, with Congress passing specific statutes. These sanctions limit trade to humanitarian-related goods. The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, limiting trade to humanitarian-related goods. U.S. sanctions include restrictions on financial transactions, new investments, and foreign aid, with prohibitions on transactions involving North Korea's key sectors. U.S. persons are also prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities. The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, limiting trade to humanitarian-related goods and prohibiting transactions involving key sectors like mining, energy, and finance. U.S. foreign aid is minimal and emergency-based, administered through centrally funded programs to prevent the North Korean government from benefiting. U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities, including Kim Jong-un and the Korean Workers' Party. U.S. travel to North Korea is restricted and requires a special validation passport. North Korea's demands in negotiations regarding its weapons programs have been inconsistent over the years. North Korea's behavior in negotiations has been inconsistent, with demands changing over the years. Pyongyang has vacillated between limited cooperation and overt provocations, including testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. U.S. travel to North Korea is restricted and requires a special validation passport. North Korean behavior has varied between cooperation and provocations, including testing missiles and nuclear devices. Pyongyang's negotiations are influenced by internal conditions like food shortages, seeking aid from China, the US, or South Korea. North Korea exploits divisions among parties and political transitions to stall nuclear talks, leading to debates on the effectiveness of negotiations. North Korea has exploited divisions among parties and political transitions to stall nuclear talks. Analysts argue negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict and feasible due to Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development. A basic bargain could involve security, end to the Korean War, economic benefits, and sanctions removal in exchange for denuclearization. Kim Jong-un's emphasis on economic development in 2018 suggests a decision to denuclearize. North Korea may not voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing it as essential for regime survival. Analysts believe Pyongyang's demands are tactical, and Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 indicates a potential decision to denuclearize. Without relief from sanctions and isolation, achieving economic goals will be challenging for North Korea. The Korean regime is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons capability voluntarily, viewing it as crucial for regime survival. Analysts believe Pyongyang's demands are tactical, and recent statements indicate a commitment to maintaining and modernizing its nuclear deterrent. North Korea has reiterated its demand to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state and declared its nuclear weapons are not negotiable. The country has modernized its nuclear deterrent and stated it will not give up its nuclear stockpile until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. North Korea insists on being acknowledged as a nuclear weapons state and refuses to negotiate its nuclear arsenal. The country believes that possessing nuclear weapons is crucial for regime security, fearing overthrow without them. The 2018 Singapore summit was seen as legitimizing North Korea as a nuclear state, as the U.S. President met with Kim Jong-un and agreed to work towards denuclearization. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some of its demands such as canceling military exercises and easing sanctions. Prior to this, the US engaged in various nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea. The United States engaged in multiple nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, including the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The negotiations involved North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected North Korea's plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, which were not monitored as required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1986, U.S. intelligence discovered North Korea's unmonitored plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. After obstructing inspections, North Korea announced its intent to withdraw from the treaty, leading to discussions of a preemptive military strike. Diplomatic efforts, including sanctions and a mission by former President Jimmy Carter, eventually resulted in the 1994 Agreed Framework between the U.S. and North Korea. The 1994 Agreed Framework between the U.S. and North Korea led to negotiations for North Korea to receive nuclear power plants and fuel in exchange for freezing its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. Despite delays, North Korea froze its program, received fuel, and started reactor construction. Compliance issues arose regarding declaring all nuclear facilities to the IAEA. The Agreed Framework with North Korea faced delays in reactor construction and funding. Despite North Korea freezing its plutonium program and receiving fuel, it did not fully declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA. In 2002, the US confronted North Korea about a suspected uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of fuel shipments and reactor construction. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility. In response to delays in reactor construction and funding, the United States halted fuel shipments and construction of LWRs in North Korea. This led to North Korea expelling IAEA inspectors, withdrawing from the NPT, and restarting its reactor and reprocessing facility. The Clinton Administration then engaged in negotiations with North Korea to curb its missile program and exports. In 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on long-range missile testing in exchange for lifting some U.S. sanctions. In September 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on testing long-range missiles in exchange for the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions and bilateral talks. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in October 2000 to finalize terms of a new agreement, but a final agreement was elusive. Negotiations under the George W. Bush Administration expanded to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia, with six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008 yielding occasional progress but ultimately failing to resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear arms. The George W. Bush Administration expanded negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia through the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008. Despite occasional progress, the talks failed to resolve the fundamental issue of North Korean nuclear arms. A promising breakthrough in 2005 led to a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees, but the process eventually broke down due to verification disagreements. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea focused on pressuring Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks. The policy involved commitments to denuclearization, coordination with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on its nuclear activities under the right conditions. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang through arms interdictions, sanctions, and multilateral sanctions. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on its nuclear activities under the right conditions. The policy also included large-scale military exercises to demonstrate the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance. Additionally, the Obama Administration issued executive orders to implement U.N. sanctions and declare additional unilateral sanctions on entities and individuals involved in illicit activities. In addition to U.N. sanctions, the Obama Administration issued executive orders targeting entities and individuals involved in North Korean illicit activities, including weapons sales, money laundering, and cyberattacks. President Obama also authorized the seizure of assets of designated DPRK officials after the Sony cyberattack. Despite efforts for engagement, provocations by Pyongyang stalled negotiations. Following the Sony cyberattack, attributed to North Korean hackers by the FBI, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 allowing the U.S. government to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang hindered negotiations. The U.S. focused on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea through multilateral sanctions, with the exception of the \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 after Kim Jong-il's death, committing North Korea to a nuclear moratorium. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment in exchange for US assistance. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a nuclear test in 2013. US policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China due to its economic ties with the country. North Korea violated the \"Leap Day Agreement\" in 2012 by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a nuclear test in 2013. US policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner providing essential aid to the regime. China prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse. China's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. Beijing sees strategic value in having North Korea as a buffer between China and South Korea. China often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher sanctions on North Korea in international forums like the U.N. Chinese companies have been found violating sanctions against North Korea. China's obstruction of U.S. efforts to impose harsher sanctions on North Korea is a significant obstacle. Chinese companies have been found violating sanctions, and Beijing's enforcement of sanctions has been inconsistent. However, in 2017, China increased its enforcement of UNSC sanctions, possibly to deter U.S. military action against North Korea. China's trade and aid to North Korea are limited, likely to maintain a responsible image internationally. China's limited trade and aid to North Korea is seen as a way to maintain a responsible international image, despite strained relations with Pyongyang. Beijing's reluctance to fully support North Korea is driven by a desire to avoid being seen as an enabler of a rogue regime. Relations between China and North Korea soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power, particularly after the execution of his uncle, who had been a key intermediary with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping's meetings with South Korean leaders also indicate a shift away from supporting North Korea. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang deteriorated after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, especially following the execution of his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013. Chinese President Xi Jinping's meetings with South Korean leaders signaled a shift away from supporting North Korea. Chinese public opinion also turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. In 2017, China agreed to stringent UNSC sanctions resolutions and appeared to be implementing them. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 restored some closeness in the North Korea-China relationship. Kim traveled to Beijing to reaffirm ties with China before meeting Trump. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, has strengthened his relationship with China by achieving results that Beijing perceives as victories. This includes deescalation of hostilities, turning to diplomacy, and canceling U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Kim's visits to Beijing in 2018 signaled his efforts to reaffirm ties with China before meeting with Trump. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, has consolidated power and pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons development. His bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests he has strengthened his regime and economy, with analysts crediting him for his assertiveness in diplomacy. Kim Jong-un has consolidated power in North Korea and pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons. He has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent\" and improved relations with South Korea, China, and the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Some hoped he would be a political reformer, but his actions have not shown this. Kim Jong-un has consolidated power in North Korea and pursued economic opportunities by improving relations with South Korea and China. He has also made progress with the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Despite initial hopes of being a political reformer, Kim's actions have shown a ruthless drive to maintain the dynastic dictatorship. He has carried out purges of senior officials, including the execution of his uncle in 2013 and the alleged assassination of his half-brother in 2017. Kim Jong-un has displayed a different ruling style than his father, allowing Western influences and being informal in public appearances. He has replaced over 300 senior officials and carried out purges, including the execution of his uncle and the alleged assassination of his half-brother. Kim Jong-un has allowed Western influences and is informal in public appearances, in contrast to his father's aloof and remote style. He introduced his wife to the public but keeps their children hidden. Analysts see these changes as an attempt to appear young and modern, reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung. North Korea is one of the world's poorest countries with a centrally planned economy. Kim Jong-un has introduced economic policy changes that have spurred growth in North Korea, lifting living standards for many. Despite being one of the world's poorest countries with a centrally planned economy, North Korea has managed to weather international sanctions through increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion activities. Under Kim's leadership, market principles have been implemented to drive economic progress. Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes have boosted North Korea's production and helped it withstand international sanctions. Market principles have been allowed in some sectors, leading to growth in markets and ancillary services. Kim promotes domestic manufacturing and a shift towards domestically produced goods. The marketization process in North Korea has been facilitated by international trade with China, leading to an expansion in markets and ancillary services. Kim Jong-un emphasizes domestic manufacturing and a shift towards domestically produced goods. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have resulted in larger harvests since 2010. Food prices have been stable since around 2012, but food security remains a concern for many North Koreans. Since 2010, North Korea has seen larger harvests due to favorable planting conditions. While food prices have been stable since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity. Analysts question the extent of Kim's reforms, as private enterprise is prohibited by the penal code. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes in North Korea can be considered true \"reforms\" due to restrictions on private enterprise and conflicting evidence on marketization. Many North Koreans face limited access to healthcare and food shortages, with the regime claiming universal healthcare but only the elite having access to better facilities in Pyongyang. Many North Koreans have limited access to healthcare and face food shortages. The regime claims universal healthcare, but most hospitals are in poor condition. In Pyongyang, only the elite have access to better facilities. The regime controls where families can live based on loyalty, limiting access to quality medical care. North Koreans struggle to afford medications and bribes for doctors. Pyongyang is losing control over information flow, with some turning to outside news sources. North Koreans struggle to afford medications and bribes for doctors. Pyongyang is losing control over information flow, with some turning to outside news sources despite government efforts to prevent access to foreign broadcasts. Defectors report citizens using illegal or modified radios to listen to foreign programs. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network. North Korean defectors report citizens using illegal or modified radios to listen to foreign broadcasts. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in cooperation with Orascom, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls, despite being illegal. The regime allows increased mobile-phone use for surveillance purposes. Some reports suggest North Korean cadres consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling operations. Increased access to information through the use of Chinese cellphones near the border is seen as a potential vulnerability for the North Korean regime. Reports indicate that some North Korean cadres are involved in smuggling and selling operations, while a survey showed that a significant percentage of North Koreans own domestic mobile phones and access sensitive media content. This dissemination of information could lead to positive changes in the country's political system, according to a paper published by the Harvard University Belfer Center in 2015. Increased access to information in North Korea, particularly through the use of Chinese cellphones near the border, is considered a potential vulnerability for the regime. A survey revealed that 28% of North Koreans own domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media content. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, believes that outside sources of information could challenge the regime's indoctrination efforts and encourage citizens to question their living conditions. The regime heavily relies on propaganda to maintain loyalty and portray the outside world as inferior. North Korea boasts one of the largest militaries globally, with 1.28 million personnel in uniform and significant defense spending. North Korea has a large military with 1.28 million personnel and significant defense spending. They have deployed most of their forces near the border with South Korea for rapid deployment in case of conflict. The regime is developing WMD capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces, including nuclear weapons. North Korea is developing its WMD capabilities, including nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces. They also possess a large stockpile of chemical weapons and potentially biological weapons. Pyongyang has developed offensive cyber operations capabilities, with 6,000 cyber warfare troops according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. The U.S. intelligence community assesses North Korea as a significant cyber threat in 2018. North Korea's cyber warfare capabilities are a significant concern, with the U.S. intelligence community identifying them as one of the top cyber threats to the United States in 2018. South Korea's Defense Ministry reports that North Korea has 6,000 cyber warfare troops. Despite North Korea's weakened conventional military capabilities, they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks in the event of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul within the first hour of a war. In the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula, North Korea could cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Despite having outdated military equipment, North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities in recent years. This includes unmanned aerial vehicles, offensive cyber operations, special operations forces, GPS jamming, stealth and infiltration, and electromagnetic pulse technology. North Korea has modernized its military with asymmetric capabilities like UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, stealth, and electromagnetic pulse technology. They have also made advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, submarines, and special operations forces. The North Korean military suffers from institutional weaknesses that would limit its effectiveness in a major conflict. North Korea's military has institutional weaknesses that would hinder its effectiveness in a major conflict. The totalitarian government system centralizes command and control, limiting independent actions. War plans are rigid and lack flexibility, with mid-level officers lacking training and authority for initiative. Resource scarcity affects readiness, with fuel shortages impacting flight training, logistical issues hindering troop movement, spare parts shortages reducing equipment availability, and food shortages impacting personnel. The U.S. remains concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development, with analysts skeptical of Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize despite ongoing talks. The country's military readiness is affected by resource scarcity, including fuel shortages impacting flight training, logistical issues hindering troop movement, spare parts shortages reducing equipment availability, and food shortages impacting personnel endurance in combat. The U.S. intelligence community views North Korean nuclear weapons as for deterrence, prestige, and diplomacy. Despite talks on denuclearization, skepticism remains on Pyongyang's commitment. North Korea sees its nuclear arsenal as vital for survival and deterring U.S. attacks. North Korean Foreign Ministry official Choe Son Hui stated in October 2017 that their nuclear arsenal is crucial for survival and deterring US attacks. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb test in September 2017. The regime is focused on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads for potential deployment on intercontinental ballistic missiles. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb test in September 2017. The tests produced progressively higher magnitude blasts, with the regime perfecting a two-stage thermonuclear warhead for delivery on an intercontinental ballistic missile. In early 2018, North Korea announced the cessation of nuclear tests and the closure of its test site, but fissile material production continues. The North Korean nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union near Yongbyon. The North Korean nuclear program started in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union near Yongbyon. A small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium began operating in 1986. The reactor and reprocessing facility have been alternately operational and frozen under safeguards since the 1994 Agreed Framework and the Six Party Talks. Since 2008, North Korea has restarted its reactor and reprocessing plant. Since the collapse of the Six Party Talks in 2008, North Korea has resumed its nuclear activities, including restarting its reactor and reprocessing plant, building a uranium enrichment plant, and constructing a new experimental light water reactor. It is estimated that North Korea has produced between 30 and 40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. Additionally, intelligence has revealed a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium (HEU), with North Korea openly acknowledging a uranium enrichment program in 2009. North Korea has produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons and has a uranium enrichment program. They have shown construction of a light-water reactor and uranium enrichment plant, with suspicions of other clandestine facilities. Stockpile estimates are difficult due to lack of information. North Korea's Yongbyon site has an operational enrichment plant, but other clandestine facilities likely exist. A site at Kangson was identified in July 2018. Estimates on warhead and material stockpiles are challenging due to lack of transparency. Scholarly analyses suggest North Korea could produce 20-100 warheads by 2020. The country prioritizes the development of ballistic missile technology despite international condemnation. North Korea has conducted numerous ballistic missile tests since 2011, aiming to enhance its offensive capabilities and evade US missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 tests, followed by 18 tests in 2017, including suspected ICBM launches. The country is estimated to produce 20-100 warheads by 2020. North Korea has conducted multiple ballistic missile tests to improve its ability to evade US missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 tests, followed by 18 tests in 2017, including suspected ICBM launches. The country is estimated to have approximately 700 short-range ballistic missiles. The main objective of North Korea's nuclear weapons program is to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles, with the KN-08 and Taepodong-2 identified as potential ICBMs. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to the Korean Peninsula and mainland Japan, including some U.S. military bases. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of the KN-08 and KN-14 missiles. North Korea has demonstrated progress in its missile programs, including the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile. The KN-08 and Taepodong-2 are identified as potential ICBMs for delivering nuclear warheads to the continental United States. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of these missiles, and there have been assessments of initial steps towards fielding the ICBM system. Testing has been conducted, with growing success in medium-range ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Additional testing may be required according to a Department of Defense report. North Korea has shown progress in its missile programs, including mounting a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile. Potential ICBMs like KN-08 and Taepodong-2 could deliver nuclear warheads to the US. Recent focus is on developing missiles to defeat missile defenses like Patriot and THAAD. Successful tests of solid fuel MRBMs led to plans for mass production. North Korea's recent focus in its ballistic missile program is on developing missiles to defeat or degrade missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 showed missiles launched at higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more difficult. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, indicating a possible goal of conducting salvo attacks. North Korea's ballistic missile program aims to overcome missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. In 2017, they showed the ability to launch multiple missiles quickly, potentially making interception harder. They may be developing SLBMs to counter land-based defenses, like THAAD, by launching attacks from sea positions. The US has tried to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program in the past. North Korea's ballistic missile program aims to overcome missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. They may be developing SLBMs to counter land-based defenses, like THAAD, by launching attacks from sea positions. The US has tried to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program in the past, but negotiations were abandoned at the start of the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration prioritized the North Korean nuclear program over negotiations on ballistic missiles. UN resolutions imposed restrictions on North Korea's missile activities, but they continued testing. The Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on missile tests, excluding satellite launches. Recent talks have not focused on missiles, despite North Korea's active biological and chemical weapons programs. North Korea's ballistic missile program was addressed in the 2012 Leap Day Agreement, which excluded satellite launches. Recent talks have not specifically mentioned missiles, despite North Korea's active biological and chemical weapons programs. Reports indicate North Korea possesses a significant arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas, with multiple facilities for production and storage. Estimates suggest North Korea has a production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons in a typical year. North Korea has approximately 12 facilities for producing and storing chemical weapons, with a production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year. They have an estimated inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons, including sarin gas. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and could potentially target South Korea and Japan with chemical weapons. North Korea's chemical weapons production facilities pose a threat to its neighbors, with a stockpile of 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons, including sarin gas. The country is not part of the Chemical Weapons Convention and is suspected of having biological weapons capabilities, such as anthrax and smallpox. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has the infrastructure to weaponize biological agents. North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons capability and biotechnology infrastructure to support it, with a munitions production capacity for weaponizing biological agents. The country is suspected of possessing anthrax and smallpox. North Korea's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology is a serious concern for the United States, as they have sold missile parts and technology to various countries. Pyongyang also assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel in 2007, potentially part of a Syrian nuclear weapons program. North Korea has assisted several countries with missile sales and telemetric information, generating hard currency for the regime. They have cooperated with Syria on a nuclear reactor, transferred chemical weapons-related materials to Syria, and collaborated with Iran on missile development since the 1980s. China may have also assisted the North Korean missile program. North Korea has collaborated with Iran on missile development since the 1980s, with scientific advisors from Iran's ballistic missile research centers seen in North Korea. China has also assisted the North Korean missile program, including selling heavy transport vehicles converted into missile transport-erector-launchers. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency to support its weapons programs and uses a global network of entities for support and protection. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn foreign currency, including drug production, counterfeit currency, and smuggling. Office 39 oversees many of these activities, generating between $500 million to $1 billion annually. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies international smuggling networks. North Korea's illicit activities, overseen by Office 39, generate significant revenue, estimated at $500 million to $1 billion annually. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies international smuggling networks. There are reports of increased production of illegal narcotics since 2017, possibly due to tighter sanctions. It is unclear if these activities are directed by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea also sells cheap Cold War-era weapons to various states. North Korea engages in illicit activities, including selling cheap Cold War-era weapons to various states in the Middle East and North Africa. Authorities seized a shipment of rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Egyptian military in 2016. The regime cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles with Iran and supplying weapons to Syria through front companies to mask its dealings. North Korea uses front companies based in China to mask its illicit dealings and access the international financial system. These companies keep the regime's earnings in overseas bank accounts, making it harder to track the money. In one case, a Chinese company used over 20 front companies to conduct transactions in U.S. dollars for a sanctioned entity. North Korea uses front companies in China to hide earnings in overseas bank accounts, making it difficult to track. The U.S. government has sanctioned companies aiding the North Korean regime, such as the Chinese bank Bank of Dandong. Treasury Department previously targeted Banco Delta Asia for distributing counterfeit currency and laundering money for North Korea. The U.S. government sanctioned Bank of Dandong for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activities, freezing $24 million in North Korean accounts. North Korea's response included boycotting talks until the funds were returned. Past administrations have highlighted North Korea's human rights abuses, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the issue. The State Department's reports depict a consistent pattern of extreme human rights violations in North Korea. The State Department's reports and private organizations highlight North Korea's severe human rights abuses, including a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties, lack of freedoms of speech and press, and extensive ideological indoctrination. Reports also detail physical abuse and the existence of prison camps. The human rights situation in North Korea is dire, with a lack of political, civil, and religious freedoms. Citizens face severe physical abuse for violating laws, and there are reports of prison camps housing political prisoners in harsh conditions. North Korea's prison camps hold 5,000 to 50,000 political prisoners in harsh conditions, leading to high mortality rates. Reports detail starvation, disease, executions, and torture as common practices. The United Nations has been a key advocate for addressing human rights violations in North Korea. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, with a focus on political prisoners in harsh conditions. The number of political prisoners has decreased due to high mortality rates in camps. Special positions like the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry have been established to investigate and report on human rights abuses in the country. In 2013, the U.N. Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry (COI) to investigate human rights violations in North Korea, concluding that the regime had committed \"crimes against humanity.\" The U.N. General Assembly recommended referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2014, but no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. In 2014, the U.N. General Assembly recommended referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for human rights violations. However, no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. In March 2017, the U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of North Korea's abuses for potential future prosecution. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China in the past two decades, facing further abuse and neglect if caught and repatriated. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to neighboring China in the past two decades to escape food shortages, persecution, and human rights abuses. They face further abuse, neglect, and lack of protection, with many becoming victims of human trafficking. Some refugees make their way to Southeast Asia to seek passage to South Korea, where they receive citizenship. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors entering South Korea has declined, with 1,127 defectors in 2017, a 21% decrease from 2016. This decrease may be attributed to tightened border patrols. Elite defections in 2016, including senior officials, have changed the demographic profile of defectors. Despite the overall decrease, some defectors with good social status continue to escape to South Korea. Since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, elite defections have increased, reflecting a changing profile of North Korean defectors. Tightened border security has made it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. Diplomats, responsible for earning foreign currency, may defect if unable to meet expectations. Elite defectors risk imprisonment or execution if caught, prompting many to flee to China. Since the late 2000s, diplomats in North Korea have been tasked with earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for the regime. Those unable to meet expectations may choose to defect, facing imprisonment or execution if caught. Many defectors flee to China, where thousands are in hiding. China has been criticized for repatriating defectors, with accusations of aiding crimes against humanity. Kirby accused Chinese officials of potentially aiding crimes against humanity by cooperating with North Korea to repatriate defectors. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors violates the U.N. Refugee Convention, as they are labeled as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deported instead of being granted asylum. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors violates the U.N. Refugee Convention by labeling them as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deporting them instead of granting asylum. Beijing's policy is based on a repatriation treaty with North Korea, making it illegal to assist the refugees in any way. Despite the risks faced by defectors upon return to North Korea, China maintains its stance on repatriation to uphold national security and social order. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors is based on a treaty with North Korea, labeling them as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deporting them. Assisting refugees is illegal in China, but political refugees reaching foreign embassies can leave the country. Beijing fears allowing refugees in may lead to destabilization and the collapse of the North Korean regime, which is seen as detrimental to China's interests. The Chinese government is cautious about allowing North Korean refugees into China due to fears of destabilizing its northeastern provinces and causing the collapse of the North Korean regime. In 2004, the North Korean Human Rights Act was passed, authorizing funds for human rights efforts in North Korea and appointing a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) includes provisions for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be tied to human rights improvements in North Korea. It also mandates the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea. North Koreans can seek asylum in the U.S. under this act, with the State Department facilitating their applications. The act has been reauthorized in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with Congress requiring additional reporting on resettling North Korean refugees in the U.S. and enhancing refugee processing efforts. The NKHRA was reauthorized by Congress in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with a focus on resettling North Korean refugees in the U.S. and enhancing refugee processing efforts. The 2018 reauthorization bill emphasized increasing freedom of information into North Korea and was signed into law by President Trump. Analysts have raised concerns about North Korea's overseas workers and their working conditions. President Trump signed the NKHRA reauthorization bill into law in 2018, focusing on resettling North Korean refugees and enhancing refugee processing. Analysts have highlighted North Korea's overseas workers' harsh working conditions, with the State Department citing forced labor practices. Workers endure long hours, living in exploitative conditions akin to \"state-sponsored slavery,\" while their families are monitored by government minders. North Korean overseas laborers work under exploitative conditions, toiling between 12 to 20 hours a day. The regime takes a significant portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions annually. The program has been ongoing for decades, with workers in various countries, totaling 50,000 to 80,000 individuals. North Korea's overseas-labor program has a long history, with laborers sent to Russia, Africa, and the Middle East since the 1960s. There are 50,000 to 80,000 North Koreans working abroad, mainly in Russia and China. The Trump Administration has pressured countries to send these workers home by 2019, with sanctions in place for those using North Korean labor. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (P.L. 115-44) prohibits North Korean goods from entering the US and sanctions foreign entities using North Korean labor. The US provided over $1.2 billion in aid to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with no aid given since 2009. Energy assistance was tied to progress in the Six-Party Talks, which ended in 2009. Technical assistance was provided for nuclear disablement until April 2009. Since early 2009, the United States provided heavy fuel oil to North Korea, tied to progress in the Six-Party Talks. Technical assistance for nuclear disablement was given until April 2009. However, after North Korea's provocative actions in 2009, including missile tests and nuclear activities, Congress rejected further assistance requests. U.S. food aid ended in early 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. Congress rejected Obama Administration's requests for funds to supplement resources in Six-Party Talks. U.S. food aid ended in 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. North Korea periodically appeals for international support. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided food aid. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from Korean War are \"unaccounted-for.\" North Korean officials engaged with Members of Congress from 1990 to 1992. The U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency reports nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are \"unaccounted-for,\" with efforts made to recover POW-MIAs in North Korea through joint investigations from 1996 to 2005. 229 sets of remains were recovered and identified during these operations. States agreed to conduct joint investigations to recover the remains of thousands of U.S. servicemen unaccounted for during the Korean War. The U.S. military and the Korean People's Army conducted 33 joint investigations from 1996 to 2005 for these POW-MIAs, recovering 229 sets of remains and identifying 107. However, operations in North Korea faced difficulties, leading to the suspension of all joint field activities in 2005 due to North Korea's actions related to nuclear weapons development and safety concerns for U.S. search teams. The uncertain environment created by North Korea's unwillingness to participate in the Six-Party Talks, its declarations regarding nuclear weapons development, and concerns about the safety of U.S. search teams led to the suspension of joint field activities in 2005. Despite providing over $20 million for recovery assistance, talks between the U.S. and North Korea on a joint recovery program were suspended in 2012 due to Pyongyang's rocket launch announcement. The credibility of North Korean commitments was questioned, leading to the suspension of the joint mission. No Joint Field Activities have been undertaken with the Korean People's Army. In January 2012, the Department of Defense announced plans for a mission to return to North Korea, but it was suspended in March 2012 due to Pyongyang's rocket launch announcement. North Korea warned about the potential damage to U.S. POW-MIAs remains in October 2014, signaling a desire for broader negotiations with the U.S. The recovery of missing U.S. soldiers' remains is a priority for the U.S. government. The Department of Defense prioritizes the recovery of missing U.S. soldiers' remains, with recent efforts including the repatriation of 55 cases of remains from North Korea. Delays in the transfer were reportedly due to North Korea's request for payment. In July, North Korea handed over 55 cases of remains to the United Nations Command for repatriation to the U.S. military. Delays were caused by North Korea's request for payment, which the U.S. does not provide. NGOs are involved in various capacity-building and people-to-people exchanges in North Korea. Some NGOs play smaller roles in capacity building and people-to-people exchanges in North Korea, including areas like agriculture, health, informal diplomacy, information science, and education. Despite turbulent relations, some U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts. Religious organizations with humanitarian philosophies provide aid to vulnerable sectors of the North Korean population. Several religious organizations with humanitarian philosophies are active in North Korea on a small scale, aiming to provide aid to vulnerable sectors of the population and promote peaceful relations through people-to-people ties. Many NGOs have faced challenges in their operations in North Korea since 2016 due to tighter U.S. and international sanctions and restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration in 2017. The Trump Administration imposed sanctions and restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea in 2017, affecting humanitarian work. Various reports by CRS discuss U.S. policy approaches, nuclear negotiations, peace treaty possibilities, and North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The Trump Administration imposed sanctions and restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea in 2017, affecting humanitarian work. Various reports by CRS discuss U.S. policy approaches, nuclear negotiations, peace treaty possibilities, and North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, including details on ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region. The CRS reports by various authors discuss U.S.-South Korea relations, ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region, and technical issues related to North Korea's nuclear weapons."
