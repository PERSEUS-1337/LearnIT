    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\". Congress acknowledges the serious decline of crane populations globally, especially in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five species of Asian cranes are endangered, including the Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, white-naped crane, black-necked crane, and hooded crane. The Crane Action Plan of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature focuses on four crane species. The Crane Action Plan of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature identifies seriously threatened crane species from Africa and Asia, including the wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane. Additionally, the whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species. The grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane are identified as seriously threatened species. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species with populations vulnerable to extinction due to hunting and habitat loss. Conservation efforts have been insufficient to address the decline in crane populations. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered species facing threats such as hunting, habitat loss, egg collection, poisoning, and collisions with power lines. Conservation efforts have been inadequate to address the decline in crane populations. Establishing crane conservation programs would benefit various plant and animal species, including endangered ones. To protect cranes and other species, conservation efforts are needed to address threats like egg collection, poisoning, power line collisions, warfare, and trapping. International cooperation is essential to effectively reduce these risks. Cranes serve as ambassadors for promoting goodwill between countries due to their migratory nature. The joint commitment and effort of countries in Africa, Asia, and North America, along with the private sector, are required to address threats to cranes in the wild. Cranes are known ambassadors for promoting goodwill between countries as they migrate across continents. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region can be applied globally, and there is much to learn and teach between conservationists in different countries. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods and procedures to ensure the population of crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, and management assistance. The Crane Conservation Act focuses on habitat management, research, monitoring, management plan development, enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement, reintroduction of cranes, conflict resolution, community participation, outreach, and education. The Convention refers to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Fund supports crane conservation efforts. The Crane Conservation Act includes provisions for conflict resolution initiatives, community outreach, and education. The terms \"Convention\" and \"Fund\" are defined in relation to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Crane Conservation Fund, respectively. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants must submit project proposals meeting specified requirements for eligibility. Applicants for crane conservation projects must submit project proposals meeting specific requirements to the Secretary. Eligible applicants include wildlife management authorities of countries within the range of crane species, the Secretariat of the Convention, and any person or organization affecting crane populations. Applicants for crane conservation projects must submit project proposals meeting specific requirements to the Secretary. Eligible applicants include wildlife management authorities, the Secretariat of the Convention, and experts in crane conservation. Project proposals must include a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of individuals responsible, and a description of the project. Project proposals must include a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of individuals responsible, methods for implementation and assessment, staff and community management, logistics, estimated funds and time required, and evidence of support from relevant government entities. The project proposal must include logistics, estimated funds and time required, evidence of government support, matching funding information, and any other necessary details for evaluation by the Secretary. The Secretary will review project proposals within 30 days of submission and consult with other federal officials. Within 180 days of receiving a proposal, the Secretary will approve or disapprove it based on specified criteria. The Secretary, after consulting with other federal officials, will approve or disapprove project proposals within 180 days of submission. The approval or disapproval will be communicated to the applicant and other relevant officials. The Secretary will approve or disapprove project proposals within 180 days of submission and notify the applicant, other federal officials, and relevant countries. The project will be approved if it enhances conservation programs for cranes, addresses conflicts with humans, and ensures compliance with laws. The proposed project aims to enhance conservation programs for cranes by addressing conflicts with humans, ensuring compliance with laws, developing scientific information on crane habitat and population, and promoting cooperative projects on related issues. The project aims to monitor crane habitat, population numbers, and threats, promote cooperative projects among various entities, conduct scientific research on cranes, reintroduce cranes into the wild, and provide training and support for staff managing cranes. The project focuses on scientific research, successful reintroduction of cranes into the wild, and providing training for staff managing cranes and habitats. Preference is given to projects ensuring long-term conservation and those with available matching funds. The Secretary gives preference to projects ensuring long-term conservation of cranes and habitats or those with matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit reports to evaluate project progress and success for positive results, problem assessment, and fostering improvements. The Secretary convenes a panel of experts biennially to identify conservation needs for cranes. Reports on project progress and success must be made public. The Crane Conservation Fund is established under Section 6. The Crane Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. It consists of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. The Fund allows for expenditures upon request by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Crane Conservation Fund allows for expenditures to provide assistance under section 5. The Secretary may use up to 3% or $80,000 for administrative expenses. Not more than 50% of the Fund can be used for projects related to North American crane species conservation. The Crane Conservation Fund allows for expenditures to provide assistance under section 5. The Secretary may use up to 3% or $80,000 for administrative expenses. Not more than 50% of the Fund can be used for projects related to North American crane species conservation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest the remaining portion of the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Crane Conservation Fund allows investments in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. Obligations can be acquired on original issue or by purchase at market price. Any acquired obligation can be sold at market price, with proceeds credited to the Fund. Amounts required to be transferred to the Fund shall be done at least. The Crane Conservation Fund receives credits and interest from obligations held in the Fund. Transfers of required amounts are done monthly from the Treasury's general fund. The Secretary can accept donations for providing assistance under section 5. The Secretary can accept and use donations to provide assistance under section 5, with amounts received to be transferred to the Treasury for deposit in the Fund. SEC. 7. ADVISORY GROUP.
