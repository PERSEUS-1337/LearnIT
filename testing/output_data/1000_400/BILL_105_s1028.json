    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to implement a pilot project after completing an environmental impact statement. The Secretary of Agriculture must conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger to demonstrate resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The Secretary will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California to demonstrate resource management activities recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The project will be conducted in designated areas and exclude spotted owl habitat areas. The pilot project in California, conducted on Federal lands, excludes spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management activities and timber harvesting during the project term. The Regional Forester for region 5 will ensure that no road building or timber harvesting activities take place on Federal lands within the Plumas National Forest. During the pilot project in California on Federal lands, road building and timber harvesting activities are prohibited in designated areas of the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest. Riparian protection guidelines apply to all resource management and timber harvesting activities. The riparian protection guidelines from the Scientific Analysis Team apply to all resource management and timber harvesting activities in the pilot project area, based on a Forest Service research document from March 1993. The Forest Service research document from March 1993, co-authored by the Scientific Analysis Team including Dr. Jack Ward Thomas, outlines compliance requirements for resource management activities in the pilot project area. These activities must adhere to applicable Federal law and conservation guidelines for the California spotted owl. During the pilot project, the Secretary will implement resource management activities on Federal lands within the designated area, including constructing fuelbreaks on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year using various vegetation management methods. The pilot project will implement a system of defensible fuel profile zones, including shaded fuelbreaks, using thinning and other vegetation management methods on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year. Group selection and individual tree selection will be used to achieve a desired future condition of fire-resilient forests. The pilot project aims to achieve a desired future condition of fire-resilient forests through group and individual tree selection on 70,000 acres annually. Riparian management, including protection zones and restoration projects, will also be implemented. Cost-effectiveness is a key consideration for the Secretary during the project. The pilot project aims to manage 70,000 acres annually for fire-resilient forests through tree selection. Riparian management with protection zones and restoration projects will be included. Cost-effectiveness is a priority for the Secretary, using the most efficient means available. Funding will come from specific Forest Service funds allocated by the Secretary. The Secretary will use allocated funds for resource management activities according to the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal and excess funds for the administration of specific national forests. The pilot project cannot use funds designated for other National Forest System units, providing flexibility for reprogramming. The Secretary will allocate funds for resource management activities as per the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal and use excess funds for the administration of specific national forests. The pilot project is restricted from using funds designated for other National Forest System units, allowing flexibility for reprogramming. The Secretary will allocate excess funds for resource management activities in specific national forests, with restrictions on using funds that may limit other multiple use activities. Overhead costs are limited to 12 percent for administration, with at least 88 percent allocated for implementation. The Secretary will allocate funds for resource management activities in specific national forests, with overhead costs limited to 12 percent for administration. At least 88 percent of the funds will be used for implementation. Authorized supplemental funds are available as necessary, and baseline funding levels must be maintained for resource management activities. The pilot project will run from the enactment of the Act until a specified date. The Secretary will conduct a pilot project in specific national forests with allocated funds for resource management activities. Baseline funding levels must be maintained, and the project will run until completion of land and resource management plan revisions or five years after commencement. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required for statements, and the Forest Service can engage in contracting activities. The Forest Service will initiate the process to amend land and resource management plans for specific national forests within 180 days of the Act's enactment. This includes incorporating the pilot project and area designations made by subsection (b) and resource management activities. The Forest Service will amend land and resource management plans for specific national forests, including the pilot project and area designations, and other changes as warranted by analyses conducted in compliance with relevant laws. Reporting requirements are specified annually. The Forest Service will submit an annual report to Congress on the status of the pilot project, including a complete account of funds used. The Forest Service's annual report to Congress will detail the use of funds for resource management activities, including forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, and water yield increases. The annual report to Congress will include details on total acres treated for resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues and costs incurred in implementing the activities on Federal lands. The annual report to Congress will include details on total acres treated for resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, a comparison of revenues and costs incurred in implementing the activities on Federal lands, a schedule for activities in the pilot project area, descriptions of adverse environmental impacts, and limitations on Federal funds expended for each report. The final report will assess the effectiveness of the pilot project in meeting its goals, including watershed monitoring of treated lands to address water timing issues. Federal funds for each annual report are limited to $50,000. The assessment and report on the pilot project's effectiveness must include watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for this assessment are limited. The pilot project's assessment and report must include watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for this assessment are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. The project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
