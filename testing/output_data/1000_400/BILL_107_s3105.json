Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. The Secretary may make grants to States for prevention and control, with a preference for states with a high incidence of West Nile Virus. Grants under this subsection aim to develop prevention and control programs with a preference for states with a substantial incidence of West Nile Virus or related diseases. Funds must be used for community-based mosquito control plans. Funds from grants under this subsection are to be used for developing and implementing community-based mosquito control plans and programs on medical entomology and vector-borne diseases to support prevention and control efforts. Matching funds and limitations on supplanting are also required. The grant under this subsection aims to support prevention and control efforts for vector-borne diseases by providing funds for developing mosquito control programs. States receiving the grant must contribute non-Federal funds amounting to at least 50% of the program costs. The State must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to at least 50% of the program costs for mosquito control programs funded by the grant. Contributions can be in cash or in kind, excluding amounts provided by the Federal Government or services subsidized by the Federal Government. The State must contribute at least 50% of program costs for mosquito control programs funded by the grant, which can be in cash or kind. Federal government assistance or subsidies cannot be included in the State's contributions. The grant funds should supplement, not replace, State and local funds for similar activities. The Secretary has the authority to waive contribution requirements for a State facing exceptional economic conditions.

States receiving funds must involve localities in mosquito control plans and ensure 85% of the grant amount goes towards public health improvement. The grant recipients must involve localities in mosquito control plans and ensure 85% of the grant amount is spent on public health improvement related to West Nile Virus or arboviral diseases. Amounts can be used for technical assistance to support State and local health departments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can use funds to provide technical assistance to State and local health departments for mosquito control programs and arboviral disease containment. Up to 20% of the funds can be used for this purpose. The Secretary can develop mosquito abatement guidelines. The Secretary, in consultation with health organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local level. The guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local level include identifying new human cases of disease, tracking disease spread through monitoring infection in various creatures, providing laboratory support for testing, increasing participation in surveillance systems for arboviruses, and conducting educational programs. The program established under this subsection aims to monitor infection in various creatures, provide laboratory support for testing, increase participation in surveillance systems for arboviruses, conduct educational outreach campaigns, and outline procedures for mosquito control and health monitoring. The Secretary will evaluate the program within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary will evaluate the program established under this subsection within 18 months of enactment and submit a report to Congress including the results of the evaluation and information on developing a sustainable mosquito abatement program for funded States.

The program will terminate on September 30, 2004, with a possible extension for an additional fiscal year based on evaluation. The President is required to expand research to control insect populations transmitting diseases like West Nile Virus, develop screening tools, pathogen inactivation technologies, and containment methodologies. Activities may include examining existing methods and developing new ones. The President is mandated to expand research on controlling insect populations transmitting diseases like West Nile Virus.
