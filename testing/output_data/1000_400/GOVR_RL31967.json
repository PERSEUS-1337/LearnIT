    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and the government's own accounts, including trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by the government's surpluses or deficits. Debt held in government accounts is influenced by net financial flows and government accounting practices. The federal government's debt held in government accounts, such as the Social Security Trust Fund, is not directly impacted by the surplus of payroll taxes. Increases or decreases in this debt are influenced by net financial flows and government accounting practices. Since the late 1950s, the government has mostly increased borrowing from the public to cover budget deficits, except for a few exceptions. The accumulation of trust funds, especially after the Greenspan Commission's recommendations in 1983, has led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit. The government's accumulation of trust funds, particularly after the Greenspan Commission's recommendations in 1983, has led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit. Congress has periodically raised the debt limit due to the growth in federal debt held by the public and in intergovernmental accounts. Issues with the debt limit have arisen since the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, affecting the government's ability to finance activities and meet obligations. Debt Limit Since 2011, by [author name scrubbed]. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. When the debt nears its legal limit, financial management becomes more complicated. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is essential for managing federal revenues and outlays. When the debt nears its limit, financial management becomes more complex. If the debt limit prevents the Treasury from borrowing, the government may struggle to meet its obligations and manage cash flows effectively. The government's inability to borrow due to the debt limit could lead to delays in paying obligations, hindering the Treasury's ability to borrow on advantageous terms. This could result in defaulting on interest payments on Treasury securities, risking negative repercussions for economies and financial markets globally. The Government Accountability Office warns that delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Defaulting on interest payments on Treasury securities could trigger a global financial crisis. Delaying payments on obligations effectively borrows from various entities, leading to interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Delaying payments can have serious consequences for beneficiaries, state and local governments, and employees. It can result in interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Concerns have been raised by credit ratings agencies and investment banks about the financial system and economy if the U.S. Treasury cannot fund federal obligations. Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies in the past to manage cash and debt when faced with a nearly binding debt ceiling. The U.S. Treasury may face funding issues for federal obligations, potentially impacting global capital markets. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt during debt ceiling constraints, including suspending debt sales and withholding certain receipts. Congress has authorized the Treasury Secretary to use these strategies, such as invoking a \"debt issuance suspension period\" using specific government trust funds. The U.S. Treasury has used special strategies to manage cash and debt during debt ceiling constraints, including suspending debt sales and withholding certain receipts. Congress authorized the Treasury Secretary to use a \"debt issuance suspension period\" with specific government trust funds. The Treasury began selling off mortgage-backed securities acquired in 2008, targeting $10 billion per month to minimize market disruptions. As of March 2012, the Treasury's MBS portfolio has been eliminated. The U.S. Treasury has eliminated its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities acquired in 2008, selling them off at a pace of $10 billion per month to minimize market disruptions. However, proceeds from other asset sales are unlikely to sustain smooth debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama and legal experts reject this idea. The debt limit constraints pose challenges for the Treasury's financial management. While some propose using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the limit, President Obama and legal experts reject this idea. Unusual measures are taken when the debt nears its limit, causing inconvenience and uncertainty in Treasury operations. The federal debt limit requires the Treasury to take extraordinary measures when near its statutory limit, causing inconvenience and uncertainty. It allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability. Some advocate for eliminating the debt limit. The debt limit expresses national devotion to thrift and fiscal management. Some experts argue for its elimination, citing modern budget controls. The Obama Administration proposed allowing debt limit increases with congressional disapproval. Congress delegates work to committees, but the debt limit provides unique leverage. The Obama Administration proposes allowing debt limit increases with congressional disapproval, providing individual Members a separate instrument to influence federal fiscal policy. Committees on Appropriations handle discretionary spending, authorizing committees manage mandatory program spending, and Committees on the Budget draft an overall budgetary framework specifying federal spending and taxation levels. The Budget committees draft an overall budget framework that sets federal spending and taxation levels. Congress historically imposed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Before World War I, borrowing was authorized for specific purposes, while between the wars, an aggregate debt limit applied to all federal debt. Congress also specified the types of financial instruments Treasury could use. During World War II, statutory restrictions on federal debt evolved into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all federal debt outstanding. Congress granted the Treasury Secretary discretion to choose debt instruments, with opponents raising concerns about the impact on monetary policies. However, these concerns became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. Some opponents raised concerns about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies and tightening credit conditions. Proponents argued that federal borrowing would not disrupt settlements on monetary issues from 1878 and 1890. Concerns became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management, as well as long-term bonds. Treasury Secretary was authorized to have $100 million in certificates of indebtedness with maturities under a year, mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. The 1898 War Revenue Act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $100 million in short-term certificates of indebtedness to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. It also allowed for $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds for public subscription. The act aimed to give the Treasury Secretary administrative leeway within set limits, which expanded over time. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 further relaxed restrictions on bond maturity and redemption, incorporating unused borrowing capacity from previous acts. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 expanded the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway by dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. It also incorporated unused borrowing capacity from previous acts, setting the stage for subsequent borrowing measures until 1982. This reflected changes in legislative drafting practices at that time. In the 1920s, Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with additional leeway to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues, including issuing notes and reintroducing savings certificates for small investors. In the 1930s, Congress moved towards aggregate constraints on federal borrowing, allowing the Treasury greater flexibility to roll over debt. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing for more efficient management of public debt. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of Treasury's freedom in determining securities to be issued. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds to manage public debt efficiently. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of Treasury's freedom in determining securities to be issued. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau later called for replacing limits on bond issuance with more flexible limits on outstanding bonds, highlighting their role in federal finance management. Congress established limits of $20 billion on shorter-term debt and $25 billion on outstanding bonds. President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt in 1939. In March 1939, Congress established a $20 billion limit on shorter-term debt and a $25 billion limit on outstanding bonds. President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt. The law created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt, allowing the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively. On July 20, 1941, the law (P.L. 76-201) increased the aggregate debt limit to $65 billion, consolidating limits on bonds and shorter-term debt. This gave the Treasury more flexibility to manage federal debt by issuing instruments with different maturities to reduce interest costs and financial risks. The separate $4 billion limit for \"National Defense\" series securities was folded back under the increased aggregate limit. This delegation of greater independence to the Treasury occurred just before the United States entered World War II. In 1940, a limit for \"National Defense\" series securities was introduced, and in 1941, legislation increased the aggregate debt limit to $65 billion. The debt limit during World War II was closer to total federal debt compared to the end of World War I. The debt ceiling was raised annually from 1941 to 1945 to accommodate costs of the war, reaching $300 billion. After World War II, the debt limit was reduced to $275 billion. After World War II, the debt limit was reduced to $275 billion. The limit remained at $275 billion until 1954 due to financing the Korean War on a pay-as-you-go basis. Temporary increases were approved in 1954 and 1957, with Congress emphasizing the need for better financial management. In March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion, its level at the end of World War II. Congress has enacted 78 measures altering the federal debt limit, with some recent increases being significant, such as a $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. During FY1998-FY2001, federal debt grew by $855 billion despite government surpluses. Since FY1998-FY2001, federal debt grew by $855 billion despite government surpluses. Recent increases in the debt limit have been significant, such as a $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. Debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits since FY2001. Table 1 and Figure 1 show components of federal debt in current dollars and as percentages of GDP. Since FY1998-FY2001, federal debt increased by $855 billion despite government surpluses. Debt held by government accounts has grown steadily since 1982, partly due to Social Security tax increases. Debt held by the public has increased due to persistent budget deficits since FY2001. Table 2 provides information on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. The 1983 Greenspan Commission led to surpluses in the federal government from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing debt as a percentage of GDP. However, deficits returned in FY2002, increasing debt held by the public. This added pressure on the debt limit in 2002. In FY2002, deficits reemerged, leading to increases in debt held by the public and pressure on the debt limit. By the end of May 2002, debt subject to limit was close to the existing $5,950 billion limit, with a $117 billion increase in debt held by government accounts and a $100 billion increase in debt held by the public. In 2002, the debt subject to the limit was increased by $217 billion, with $117 billion held by government accounts and $100 billion held by the public, nearing the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the debt limit to $6,700 billion due to a deteriorating budget outlook. Treasury suspended reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund to keep debt below the limit in April 2002. In April 2002, the Treasury kept debt below the limit by suspending reinvestment in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. This allowed the Treasury to issue new debt and meet government obligations. The debt subject to limit stood at $5,949,975 million, just $25 million below the limit. After tax revenues flowed in, the Treasury restored the G-Fund by crediting the fund with interest on the debt. By the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen back $35 billion below the limit. The Treasury restored the G-Fund by crediting it with interest on the debt after tax revenues flowed in. By the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen back $35 billion below the limit. The Treasury used its statutory authority to avoid default for the second time in 2002, but requested Congress to raise the debt limit to address ongoing financing problems. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit or make statutory changes to issue new debt due to ongoing financing problems. Without an increase, the government would exceed the debt ceiling by May 16, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. The Treasury took extraordinary actions to manage the situation, including suspending investments in trust funds and replacing debt with non-interest-bearing instruments. These measures were expected to last until June 28, 2002. The Treasury reduced federal debt held by government accounts by replacing it with non-interest-bearing instruments to meet obligations. Without a debt limit increase by June 28, 2002, the Treasury would need to take further actions to avoid breaching the ceiling, potentially leading to a default. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit during May and June 2002. The Treasury warned of potential default as it faced exhausting options to issue debt and meet obligations by the end of June and beginning of July. Congress debated increasing the debt limit in May and June 2002, with the Senate eventually passing a bill to raise the limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion in June 2002, avoiding a potential default. The House narrowly approved the increase on June 27, and the President signed it into law on June 28 (P.L. 107-199, 116 Stat. 734). Treasury Deputy Secretary Kenneth Dam requested an unspecified further increase in the debt limit by late February 2003. The $450 billion debt limit increase was passed by a single vote on June 27, signed into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the debt limit to avoid financial problems. By February 20, 2003, the Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the limit. The Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the debt limit. Actions included replacing internally held government debt with non-debt instruments in certain accounts and not issuing new debt to these accounts. This allowed the Treasury to issue additional debt to the public to acquire cash needed for government commitments. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" deeming legislation raising the debt limit. The Treasury managed debt holdings to avoid reaching the debt limit. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule,\" raising the debt limit to $7,384 billion. Treasury warnings of imminent default due to debt nearing limit. Legislation raised debt limit to $7,384 billion. CBO estimated limit would be reached in summer 2004. Treasury requested Congress to raise limit to avoid disruptions. Debt reached $7,383,975 million in October. Treasury used methods to keep debt under limit. In August and September, Treasury warned of reaching debt limit in October. By mid-November, measures to avoid breaching limit would be exhausted. Failure to increase limit could harm government's reputation and raise borrowing costs. House passed FY2005 budget resolution but no final agreement with Senate. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 but did not reach a final agreement with the Senate. Without a budget resolution, no measure to raise the debt limit could be passed automatically. As the debt approached the limit, no legislation was moved to raise the debt limit, and the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government was restricted. In September 2004, the House added an amendment to remove Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached the existing limit. Senator Frist introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House in November 2004. The President signed the legislation into law on November 19, 2004. In November 2004, legislation (S. 2986) was introduced to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, from $7,384 billion to $8,184 billion. The Senate and House approved the increase, and the President signed it into law (P.L. 108-415) on November 19, 2004. The Treasury rescheduled a debt auction and canceled a \"debt limit suspension period\" after the increase. Subsequent debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were less dramatic. The debt limit increased in mid-November, allowing the Treasury to reschedule debt auctions and cancel the \"debt limit suspension period.\" Debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were less dramatic compared to previous years. Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit, but no bill was reported by the House or Senate committees. The debt limit was set to increase to $8,965 billion with a reporting date of September 30, 2005. The House Joint Resolution 47 aimed to raise the debt limit by $781 billion, but the Senate had not considered it by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Treasury Secretary Snow warned that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006. The Senate had not considered H.J.Res. 47 to raise the debt limit as called for in the budget resolution. Treasury Secretary Snow warned that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006 and requested an increase. Measures were taken to avoid reaching the limit until mid-March 2006. In March 2006, Secretary Snow authorized actions to avoid reaching the debt limit. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, raising it to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit to $9,815 billion. In mid-May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. The Treasury requested the increase due to reaching the limit in October 2007. The Senate approved the resolution without changes on September 12, 2007, and it was signed by the President on September 27. The Treasury indicated it would take steps to avoid exceeding the debt limit in late October or early November. The Senate Finance Committee approved the House resolution without changes on September 12, 2007, which was then passed by the Senate and signed by the President on September 29, 2007. Financial markets showed signs of turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious recession that lasted until 2009. Federal actions were taken to stabilize the housing and financial markets during this economic slowdown. The 2009 financial crisis and recession prompted federal actions to stabilize housing and financial markets. The economic slowdown was marked by falling housing prices and a reluctance of major financial institutions to lend. This led to efforts to unfreeze credit markets, boost consumption, and increase spending. The recession also caused a spike in federal deficit spending, reaching 9.8% of GDP. Despite declining deficits since then, the economic recovery has been weaker compared to post-World War II recessions. The 2009 financial crisis and recession led to large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending spiking to 9.8% of GDP. The economic recovery has been weak compared to other post-World War II recessions, with falling asset prices reducing federal revenues and increasing federal spending on unemployment insurance and income support programs. Boosting the economy through deficit spending provides a fiscal stimulus. Deficit spending increases during economic downturns, with automatic stabilizers like unemployment insurance paying out more as unemployment rises. This boosts the economy but can lead to inflation if output levels are high. The CBO estimated deficits in FY2008 and FY2009, which were surpassed. The 2009 financial crisis led to a spike in deficit spending, reaching 9.8% of GDP. In March 2008, CBO estimated a $396 billion deficit for FY2008 and a $342 billion deficit for FY2009, but the actual deficit for FY2008 was $455 billion. By August 2009, CBO projected deficits of $1,587 billion for FY2009 and $1,381 billion for FY2010. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in 2008 and 2009 due to economic conditions and government actions to address the recession. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions on the Budget recommended policies that would result in significant increases in the federal debt limit. The Senate and House recommended policies in FY2009 that would result in a total debt of over $10 trillion, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The budget conference report passed in the Senate and House, automatically increasing the debt limit to $10.615 billion, but the Senate did not take up the legislation, so the debt limit remained at $9.815 billion. The House passed a measure on June 4, 2008, increasing the debt limit to $10,615 billion. The Senate later passed the amended version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 on July 26, 2008, which included the debt limit increase. The President signed the bill on July 30, 2008, also authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to extend a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Senate passed the measure on July 26 with a 72-13 vote, increasing the debt limit. The President signed the bill on July 30 (P.L. 110-289), which also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to extend a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The act created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and had a 5% chance of costing taxpayers over $100 billion. The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) estimated a 5% chance of a cost to taxpayers of over $100 billion if intervention was needed for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. On September 7, 2008, FHFA placed the firms in conservatorship, giving full control to FHFA. The government has since provided stability to financial markets by deprivatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The federal government took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship to stabilize financial markets. A proposal was made to authorize the Treasury Secretary to buy mortgage-related assets up to $700 billion. Despite a rejected amendment, the Senate passed a different version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Barney Frank proposed an amendment to raise the debt limit to $11,315 billion as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The House rejected the amendment, but the Senate passed a different version of the Act (H.R. 1424) with the same debt limit increase. The Act was signed into law, and the debt limit was raised. Congress considered another economic stimulus measure, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes tax cuts and spending increases to address current economic conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included tax cuts and spending increases to address current economic conditions. It raised the debt limit to $12,104 billion, signed into law on February 17, 2009. The final conference agreement on ARRA was passed on February 13, 2009, increasing the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget resolution for FY2010 recommended a debt limit of $13,233 billion, triggering the Gephardt rule in April 2009. In August 2009, media reports indicated further developments regarding the debt limit. In April 2009, the adoption of a conference report triggered the Gephardt rule, leading to a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) to raise the debt limit to $13,029 billion. In August 2009, Treasury Secretary Geithner warned Congress of reaching the debt limit in mid-October. By reducing loans through the Supplemental Financing Program, the Treasury postponed reaching the debt limit until December. The Treasury reduced loans through the Supplemental Financing Program, extending the time until the debt limit would be reached. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lower federal debt subject to the statutory limit. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also reduce the debt subject to the limit. Other measures, like those taken in 2003, could extend the Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. Additionally, the Treasury was scheduled to issue $48 billion of nonmarketable securities. The U.S. Treasury considered reducing TARP funds and implementing other measures to lower debt subject to the limit. Despite scheduled payments and potential challenges, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit to maintain normal debt management operations. In mid-December, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit to allow normal debt management operations. H.R. 4314 was passed to raise the debt limit to $12,394 billion, and later amended to raise it to $14,294 billion with PAYGO restrictions. The Senate passed an amended version of H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling by $1,900 billion to $14,294 billion. An amendment to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\" was not approved. President Obama then charged a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with improving the fiscal situation. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling by $1,900 billion. An amendment to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\" was not approved. President Obama charged a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to improve the fiscal situation. The Fiscal Commission issued a report on December 1, 2010. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, forwarding it to the President, who signed it into law on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was longer and more contentious, resolved by the Budget Control Act. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, forwarding it to the President, who signed it into law on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, reinstating statutory caps on discretionary spending and creating other means of constraining federal spending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced on May 16, 2011, that the federal debt had reached its limit, leading to a debt issuance suspension period until about August 2, 2011. The federal debt had reached its statutory limit and declared a debt issuance suspension period, allowing extraordinary measures to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until around August 2, 2011. On July 1, 2011, the U.S. Treasury confirmed its borrowing authority would be exhausted that day. Given the size of the FY2011 federal deficit projected to reach $1,399 billion, the extraordinary measures may provide limited additional time before the government cannot meet its financial obligations. Some suggested cutting spending to slow the growth in federal debt as a means of avoiding an increase in the debt limit. According to the latest Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, extraordinary measures may provide limited time before the federal government cannot meet its financial obligations. Cutting spending to slow debt growth was suggested as a way to avoid increasing the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund on July 15, one of the last available measures before borrowing authority would be exhausted on August 2. Treasury may have less cash management headroom than previously thought. The Treasury announced the suspension of reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a key extraordinary measure before the borrowing authority is exhausted on August 2. This move may limit cash management options, making it harder to fund federal operations without a debt limit increase. Cash flow projections show a significant shortfall in August, with inflows of $174.4 billion falling short of projected outflows of $306.7 billion. Treasury estimates on the debt limit and extraordinary measures' duration are uncertain. The Treasury projects a cash inflow of $174.4 billion from August 3 to the end of the month, falling short of projected outflows by $134.3 billion. Uncertainties surround cash flow projections, debt limit constraints, and the duration of extraordinary measures. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have temporarily increased federal debt headroom. Estimates of reaching the debt limit and extending borrowing capacity align closely with Treasury's projections. Sales of mortgage-backed securities provided a small amount of additional headroom for the Treasury, aligning with estimates of reaching the debt limit and extending borrowing capacity. The Treasury Secretary indicated a potential debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand, allowing certain extraordinary measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. The Treasury Secretary planned to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted earlier, to extend borrowing capacity until August 2011. Measures like the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program had already been taken. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested a debt limit increase in January 2011, anticipating reaching the limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. The suspension of SLGS Treasury securities on May 6, 2011, was preceded by Treasury Secretary Geithner's request for a debt limit increase in January 2011. Despite projections of reaching the limit between March and May 2011, a bill to raise the debt limit was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, but was later tabled by the Senate on July 22. On July 25, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid. President Obama signed the revised compromise measure into law on August 2, 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, included provisions for deficit reduction and increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. It imposed discretionary spending caps and established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions for deficit reduction and increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. It imposed discretionary spending caps, enforced by automatic spending reductions, and established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The legislation provided a three-step procedure for increasing the debt limit, with the first increase of $400 billion on August 2, 2011. The debt ceiling was raised in three steps under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The first increase of $400 billion occurred on August 2, 2011, followed by a second increase of $500 billion on September 22, 2011. The second increase was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, which was rejected by the Senate. The House passed a disapproval measure, but the Senate did not act on it. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, triggering a provision for a $1.2 trillion increase. The President delayed the request for Congress to consider a disapproval measure. Another way to trigger a $1.5 trillion increase was through a balanced budget amendment, which failed to reach ratification. The President delayed the request for Congress to consider a disapproval measure regarding the debt limit increase. Two other ways to trigger an increase were through a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee, both of which failed to reach the required thresholds. The Super Committee failed to reach an agreement on debt reduction recommendations, leading to a $1.2 trillion debt limit increase matching budget cuts through sequestration. Treasury Secretary Geithner ensured federal obligations were met until the end of 2012. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43389. After the Super Committee's failure to reach an agreement on debt reduction, a $1.2 trillion debt limit increase was implemented through sequestration. Treasury Secretary Geithner used extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until the end of 2012. In January 2013, the House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, which was later signed into law as P.L. 113-3 on February 4. This allowed the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds and reset its ability to use extraordinary measures. After the House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, the Senate also approved the measure, which was signed into law as P.L. 113-3 on February 4. This allowed the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds and reset its ability to use extraordinary measures. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013, triggering authorities for the Treasury Secretary to use extraordinary measures. The U.S. Treasury's debt was close to the limit, prompting Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to declare a new debt issuance suspension period. Stronger revenue collections and special dividends delayed the exhaustion of borrowing capacity. Congress passed a resolution just before the projected deadline of October 17, 2013. On September 25, 2013, Secretary Lew informed Congress that the U.S. Treasury would reach its borrowing limit by October 17. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, suspending the debt limit until February 8, 2014. After the suspension ended, the debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion, and extraordinary measures were taken. Congress later suspended the debt limit until March 15, 2015. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. Treasury Secretary Lew then invoked extraordinary measures to manage the debt limit, which was reestablished at $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015. Additional measures were taken to extend the debt issuance suspension period until July 30, 2015, and later until the end of October. Treasury Secretary Lew utilized extraordinary measures to manage the debt limit, extending the suspension period until July 30, 2015, and later until the end of October. Despite lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments, Secretary Lew projected a cash reserve of less than $30 billion by November 3, 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew projected that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a cash reserve of less than $30 billion. Estimates varied due to fiscal policy changes and economic conditions. A \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues, including the debt limit. In early December 2015, estimates suggested the debt limit would be reset on March 16, 2017, under a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015. The agreement also increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law on November 2, 2015, after being approved by the Senate and House. It aimed to prevent the Treasury from creating excessive cash reserves and increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the federal government ran budget surpluses, reducing its debt, but projections of continued surpluses raised concerns about the consequences of eliminating all federal debt held by the public. From FY1998 through FY2001, the federal government had budget surpluses that reduced its debt. Projections of large surpluses raised concerns about eliminating all federal debt held by the public. However, deficits returned due to increased military and security spending after 9/11, rising nondefense outlays, tax reductions, and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession led to large federal deficits, necessitating debt limit increases. Fiscal concerns peaked in 2011 but have since diminished as deficits decreased with economic recovery. For example, the FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, federal deficits have decreased as the economy recovered. The FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP, down from 9.8% in FY2009. However, without major policy changes, persistent deficits could significantly increase federal debt, leading to slower economic growth in the long run. The current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable, according to the CBO. The current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable and could lead to slower economic growth in the long run as debt rises as a percentage of GDP. Unless federal policies change, Congress would repeatedly face demands to raise the debt limit to accommodate the growing federal debt in order to meet financial obligations. Total federal debt, debt held by government accounts, and debt held by the public have all increased since the end of FY2001. Total federal debt, debt held by government accounts, and debt held by the public have all increased since the end of FY2001. From September 2001 to September 2015, total federal debt increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts increasing by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Total federal debt has increased since the end of FY2001, with debt held in government accounts increasing by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Debt measures may fluctuate monthly due to uneven federal receipts and outlays."
