    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The purpose of the Act is outlined in section 2. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques and the use of forest restoration byproducts. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act promotes collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes to achieve ecological health objectives, impact wildfire activity and management costs, and utilize forest restoration byproducts to offset treatment costs and benefit rural economies. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" It establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, which aims to select and fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities under the program must comply with relevant laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. To be eligible for selection and funding, a proposal must be based on a complete landscape restoration strategy that identifies and prioritizes ecological aspects. To be eligible for nomination under the program, a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must be based on a complete landscape restoration strategy for a 10-year period across a landscape of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands, in need of active ecosystem restoration, and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must cover Federal lands, potentially including other Federal, State, tribal, or private land. It should focus on active ecosystem restoration and be accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. The proposal should incorporate the best available science and tools for ecological restoration, as well as requirements for old-growth maintenance and management. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must incorporate the best available science and tools for ecological restoration, as well as requirements for old-growth maintenance and management. It should be developed through a transparent and inclusive process involving multiple stakeholders. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must involve diverse stakeholders, be transparent, and have a successful track record of ecological restoration projects on federal lands. Plans should include using fire for restoration, improving wildlife habitat, and not establishing permanent roads. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal involves diverse stakeholders with a successful track record of ecological restoration projects on federal lands. Plans include using fire for restoration, improving wildlife habitat, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, decommissioning roads, and utilizing woody biomass. Annual performance reporting is required. The proposal involves stakeholders with a track record of ecological restoration projects on federal lands. Plans include using fire for restoration, improving wildlife habitat, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, decommissioning roads, and utilizing woody biomass. Annual performance reporting is required, along with developing small business incubators and providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities. The proposal involves utilizing local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, small businesses, and other entities to carry out monitoring activities in rural communities. Cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs will be analyzed. The proposal includes utilizing local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, and small businesses to conduct monitoring activities in rural communities. It will analyze cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and estimate the annual Federal funding needed for implementation. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include details on new non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding, and be subject to additional requirements determined by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The nomination process involves submission to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester, with each State submitting a proposal for covered Federal lands. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal requires nomination by State Directors of the Bureau of Land Management or Regional Foresters, with documentation including a proposal for using Federal funds. The forest landscape restoration proposal nominated by State Directors or Regional Foresters includes using Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. The forest landscape restoration proposal involves using Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands, consistent with the landscape restoration strategy. The proposal must provide evidence that funds transferred to the Secretaries will be used for ecological restoration treatments in the same fiscal year. If the proposal includes activities not covered by the Fund, additional evidence must be provided. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include evidence that Federal funds will be used for restoration treatments on Federal lands in the same fiscal year. If activities are planned on non-covered Federal land, evidence of the owner's participation and funding commitment is required. The nomination for collaborative forest landscape restoration must show the owner's intent to participate and fund the activities on non-covered Federal land. The Secretaries will select proposals meeting eligibility criteria and give special consideration to certain criteria. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals that meet eligibility criteria and give special consideration to ecological restoration strength, collaborative process strength, cost reduction potential, and long-term wildfire management benefits. The Secretaries will select up to 10 collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals annually based on criteria including cost reduction potential, long-term wildfire management benefits, and non-Federal investment leverage. Additionally, only 2 proposals per region of the National Forest System will be funded. The Secretaries may select up to 10 collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals annually, with a limit of 2 proposals per region of the National Forest System. A scientific advisory panel of experts will evaluate nominated proposals based on ecological restoration and fire ecology criteria. The Secretaries may establish a panel of experts to evaluate nominated forest restoration proposals based on ecological restoration strategies and potential cost reductions in wildfire management. A technical advisory panel of experts in rural business development and woody biomass may evaluate nominated proposals for reducing treatment costs and providing local economic benefits. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to support these efforts. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay up to 50% of the cost of ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands. It consists of appropriated amounts and interest earned on investments in the Fund. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to pay for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. The Fund is funded through appropriations and interest earned on investments. The Secretaries can request transfers from the Fund for restoration treatments. An accounting system will be established for the Fund, with $40,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. The Secretaries will establish an accounting and reporting system for the Fund, with $40,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. Implementation work plans and budgets will be created within 180 days of selecting a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal. The Secretaries will establish an accounting and reporting system for the Fund, with $40,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. Implementation work plans and budgets will be created within 180 days of selecting a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, including a description of the proposal's implementation for ecological and community economic benefit, a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, and sustainability of woody biomass supply. The Secretaries will use funds from the Fund for ecological restoration treatments that align with the landscape restoration proposal and strategy. This includes assessing costs for necessary infrastructure, ensuring sustainability of woody biomass supply, and outlining local economic benefits. Non-Federal investments in the priority landscape must be documented. The Secretaries will use funds from the Fund for ecological restoration treatments aligned with the landscape restoration proposal and strategy. An annual report will be prepared on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, including a description of treated acres and progress evaluation. The annual report will detail the accomplishments of collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals, including treated acres, progress evaluation, community benefits, multiparty monitoring results, and cost summaries for treatments and fire management activities.
