    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. The Secretary will collaborate with the EPA and the Department of Energy to administer a grant program for telecommuting. The program includes a proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program for participating employers who engage in telecommuting to reduce commuting needs for regulated entities under the Clean Air Act. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate and develop methods for telecommuting to reduce commuting needs for regulated entities under the Clean Air Act. It includes a Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program for employers to participate in. The pilot program aims to evaluate methods for reducing emissions by telecommuting employees, allowing employers to transfer emission reductions to others through certificates. The pilot program allows employers to transfer emission reductions to others through certificates, which can be traded in a commercial forum or directly exchanged with regulated entities. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through commercial trading or direct exchanges with credit holders. These credits can be presented to the Federal Government or State for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Federal Government will explore ways to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between participating employers and entities. The Clean Air Act aims to assist in achieving compliance by exploring means to transfer emission credits between employers and entities. The pilot program will be implemented in the greater metropolitan regions of Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. The Clean Air Act pilot program will also include three additional geographic areas selected by the Secretary, after consultation with the grantee. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in each geographic area. The Secretary will require the grantee to study and report to Congress and the Secretary on the program design. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the geographic area. The Secretary will require the grantee to study and report to Congress and the Secretary on the potential significance of the proposed pilot program in expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs, and its positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations totaling $250,000 for fiscal year 2000 is provided for grants related to transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life improvements at national, State, and local levels."
