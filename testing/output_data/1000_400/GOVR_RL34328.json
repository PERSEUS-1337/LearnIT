The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased research funding for science agencies like NSF and DOE, including grants for early career researchers and the establishment of ARPA-E for energy technology research. It also includes programs to recruit and train K-12 STEM teachers and student-focused STEM programs at various government agencies. Additionally, the act introduces new STEM education activities at ED, DOE, and NSF, such as a summer term educational program focused on mathematics, technology, and problem-solving at ED, a Director of Science, Engineering, and Education position at DOE, and a professional science master's program and high school laboratory program at NSF. White House efforts under OSTP aim to foster innovation and competitiveness activities, including a National Science and Technology Summit, National Technology and Innovation Medal, and President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy. To maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy, the United States must engage in trade, retain market shares, and offer high-quality products and services. Scientific and technological advances play a crucial role in creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital, as well as increasing productivity. Various factors such as scientific advances, government activities, firm organization, and serendipity can influence technological progress regardless of economic conditions. Such advances can offset disadvantages in capital and labor costs by improving production quality and efficiency. Factors like scientific advances, government activities, firm organization, and serendipity can influence technological progress. Two policy approaches for enhancing U.S. competitiveness include direct measures like budget outlays and indirect measures like financial incentives. The U.S. has used a combination of direct and indirect approaches since World War II to boost competitiveness, as highlighted in the Steelman report expressing concerns about future competition. Since World War II, the United States has utilized direct and indirect approaches to improve U.S. competitiveness. Concerns about competition from other economies were highlighted in the Steelman report post-WWII. In the 1970s, experts were worried about the rise of competitors like Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries in various industries. There were also concerns about the decline in U.S. technological superiority, particularly in high-tech exports and research and development. The United States has lost market share in various industries to major competitors like Japan. Concerns were raised about declining technological superiority, lower productivity growth, and a narrowing gap in the number of scientists and engineers compared to Japan and West Germany. This was attributed to falling U.S. expenditures for civilian R&D. The United States faced challenges in maintaining technological superiority and productivity growth compared to Japan and West Germany. Concerns arose over the proficiency of U.S. high school students in science and mathematics, as well as a decline in patents granted to Americans. Congress responded by passing several acts to address these issues, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and the Bayh-Dole Act. Additionally, the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology initiative was established. The Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-480) and other related acts were passed by Congress to address concerns about U.S. technological competitiveness. These acts included the Bayh-Dole Act (P.L. 96-517), the Federal Technology Transfer Act (P.L. 99-502), the National Cooperative Research Act (P.L. 98-462), and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-418). Additionally, initiatives like the SEMATECH consortium were created to support technological advancements in the U.S. semiconductor industry. Congressional actions also aimed to increase corporate spending on research and development, such as the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act (P.L. 97-34) and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514). The Small Business Development Act (P.L. 97-219; P.L. 99-443) set aside federal R&D funds to support innovative work in small firms. The 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided a research and experimentation tax credit to address competitiveness concerns. The Small Business Development Act established federal R&D funds for innovative small firms. By the mid-1990s, the US economy and technological innovation improved, leading to actions by manufacturers, universities, and national laboratories to enhance quality and efficiency. The US excelled in innovation-based industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, while Japan faced economic decline. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on issues related to the 21st century. In the 21st century, competitiveness concerns in the United States revolve around globalization, federal funding for research, STEM education quality, and the number of science and engineering graduates. American companies rely heavily on international markets for sales and employ foreign workers. The globalization of American companies has both positive and negative impacts on the economy, with concerns about job loss and lower wages as companies compete in the global market. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards, but also raises worries about competitiveness and job security for American workers. The United States has become more productive, leading to higher living standards and incomes. However, increased trade with low-wage countries has raised concerns about job loss and lower wages for American workers. Globalization is influenced by technology, increased labor supply, and government policies. The America COMPETES Act addresses these trends by authorizing direct measures in each policy area. The America COMPETES Act addresses the increase in world labor supply, government policies reducing trade barriers, and the need for more federal funding in basic science and engineering research to create new industries and jobs. The America COMPETES Act aims to increase federal funding for basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science to drive technological progress and create new industries and jobs. It also focuses on improving the competitiveness of the U.S. labor pool by addressing the lack of proficiency in science and mathematics among American students and the need for more individuals pursuing post-secondary STEM degrees. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve the competitiveness of the U.S. labor pool by addressing the lack of proficiency in science and mathematics among American students and the need for more individuals pursuing post-secondary STEM degrees. It initiates actions to increase the quality and quantity of STEM teachers and encourage more American students to undertake advanced STEM classes and degrees. Additionally, the act authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify possible actions the United States might undertake in government trade and investment policies. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve the competitiveness of the U.S. labor pool by addressing the lack of proficiency in science and mathematics among American students. It authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify possible actions in government trade and investment policies, as well as mechanisms to encourage more American students to undertake advanced STEM classes and post-secondary STEM degrees. Other recent legislative initiatives propose federal efforts to encourage industry spending on research and development, promote joint research activities, facilitate technology transfer, and provide incentives for quality improvements. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve competitiveness by promoting joint research activities, fostering cooperation between industry and universities, facilitating technology transfer, and providing incentives for quality improvements. Experts have differing opinions on the best actions to take to enhance competitiveness, with varying perspectives from individual domestic firms, multinational corporations, and domestic labor. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve competitiveness through joint research activities, technology transfer, and quality incentives. Competitiveness can vary for individual domestic firms, multinational corporations, and domestic labor, with a focus on trade balance in advanced technology products. The U.S. trade balance in high technology shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002. The United States trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002, with the deficit growing to $55.5 billion in 2008. This deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the high technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies. The United States trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002, reaching $55.5 billion in 2008. This deficit does not imply the U.S. is losing the high technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies. The growing deficit may warrant closer policy scrutiny, especially for U.S. multinational corporations with production facilities abroad. Competitiveness is measured by the ability of overseas operations to compete for market share with firms from foreign countries. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined after 2000 but rebounded by 2006. Competitiveness is defined as the ability of overseas operations to compete for market share with foreign firms. Domestic labor shares similar concerns and defines competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete in export markets. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete in export markets against foreign firms. Key measures for domestic labor are employment levels and wages received. The United States is a major recipient of foreign direct investments, with $249 billion invested abroad by U.S. firms in 2006. Concerns exist about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages due to these investments. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments and the largest investor abroad. U.S. firms invested $249 billion abroad in 2006. Concerns about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages exist, but most economists believe that direct investment abroad does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations. The NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations, but this classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in their occupations. For example, a chemist teaching high school chemistry and an engineer managing a manufacturing plant are not included in the analysis of the science and engineering workforce. The NSF's classification of science and engineering occupations does not encompass all individuals with S&E degrees who apply their knowledge in their jobs. This includes professionals like patent attorneys, physicians, writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants who utilize S&E training in various fields. The traditional accounting of S&E occupations may underestimate the actual size of the science and engineering workforce, which could be significantly larger, potentially two to three times more, than what government analyses suggest. The science and engineering workforce includes professionals like patent attorneys, physicians, writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants. The size of this workforce could be considerably larger than government analyses suggest, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. The most relevant number is around 17.0 million individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field. The science and engineering workforce in 2006 varied between approximately 5.0 million and 21.4 million individuals. The National Science Board (NSB) suggests that the most relevant numbers are 17.0 million individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field, or 21.4 million including related fields like health or technology. These numbers reflect the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States, differing from other data sources like the NSF, U.S. Census Bureau, and BLS. Additionally, NSF's data based on workers' reporting shows 12.9 million individuals needing a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge in 2003. The analysis shows how computerization has changed the skills needed for employment, reducing the demand for routine tasks and increasing the need for high-level tasks. This shift in tasks has led to a significant increase in the demand for college-educated workers from 1970 to 1998. The analysis highlights how computerization has shifted the skills required for employment, reducing the need for routine tasks and increasing demand for high-level tasks. This shift has led to a significant increase in the demand for college-educated workers from 1970 to 1998. The U.S. Census Bureau's long-term analysis shows a substantial growth in science and engineering occupations, outpacing the total labor force and all managers and professionals. Recent data on STEM workforce trends from BLS shows mixed results. The STEM workforce grew significantly, outpacing the total labor force and all managers and professionals. Recent data shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with computer-related occupations expected to drive most of this growth. The growth of science and engineering occupations is projected to be 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with computer-related occupations driving most of this growth. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. STEM workers' compensation is above the U.S. labor force average, with similar growth rates. The compensation for STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force average, with similar growth rates. STEM workers earn between $53,000 to $58,000 annually, higher than professions and all workers. Recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients saw a 15% increase in real salary from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after graduation were $65,000, higher than non-S&E degree holders at $49,000. Variance exists among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields. In 2003, median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after graduation were $65,000, higher than non-S&E degree holders at $49,000. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness in the global economy. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, intrafirm trade, and lack of inclusion of services and intangibles are not considered in assessing a nation's competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness highlights that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness in the global economy. Factors such as foreign affiliate sales, intrafirm trade, fragmentation of global supply chains, and lack of inclusion of services and intangibles like knowledge and intellectual property are not considered. They suggest that assessing a nation's trade balance is no longer as useful, as value is now created through intangible assets in shifting global networks of multinational firms. For individuals, additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be considered to understand prosperity. The Council on Competitiveness emphasizes the need to consider additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power to understand an individual's prosperity. The America COMPETES Act is based on the assumption that STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. It also highlights the lack of proficiency in STEM among K-12 students due to a shortage of teachers with STEM education or training. Scientists, engineers, and teachers with STEM degrees are believed to generate more enthusiasm for STEM in students. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of STEM knowledge for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. K-12 students lack proficiency in STEM due to a shortage of teachers with STEM education. Scientists, engineers, and teachers with STEM degrees can generate more enthusiasm for STEM in students, leading to a better-trained workforce. Encouraging more Americans to pursue STEM fields is crucial for the nation's competitiveness and economic growth. Obtaining STEM degrees opens up opportunities in various occupations beyond traditional roles. Encouraging more Americans to pursue STEM fields is crucial for the nation's competitiveness and economic growth. STEM degrees open up opportunities in various occupations beyond traditional roles. Additional federal funding for basic science and engineering research will make the nation more competitive by creating new industries and enhancing existing ones. The United States' competitiveness in STEM fields, particularly in science and mathematics, is lacking compared to other countries. Additional federal funding for research can create new industries, jobs, and improve existing ones. Studies show American students score lower in science and math literacy compared to international peers. American students scored below the OECD average in science and mathematics literacy in 2006. Middle school math teachers in the US are not as well-prepared as those in other countries, contributing to lower scores. The US has one of the lowest rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees globally. The United States has a low rate of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees globally. STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the US in 2002, lower than the international average of 26.4%. Research shows that investment in research and development has a significant impact on US economic growth. Some question the effectiveness of federal research programs. Investment in research and development has contributed to 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Some question the exclusive benefits of US investments in federal research programs, as research is international. The sufficiency of the nation's research investment, the influence of the federal government in STEM education, and the job creation potential of STEM investments are also debated. Some question the federal government's influence in STEM education and whether investments will lead to job creation for all Americans. Doubts exist regarding the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education. Critics question if additional scientists and engineers are needed in the U.S. given current workforce projections. Some analysts question the need for actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education, doubting the necessity of additional scientists and engineers in the country. Concerns also arise about the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India, as well as the potential unintended side-effects of implementing such actions. The set of issues focuses on unintended side-effects of implementation, such as oversupply of scientists and engineers, managing doubled funding for research programs, and challenges faced by agencies receiving funds. Proponents propose direct and indirect measures to address policymakers' concerns about U.S. competitiveness. Direct measures are emphasized in the act, while indirect measures are also being studied. Supporters of direct government assistance argue for focusing on promising technologies, while advocates of indirect measures believe the market is superior. Possible indirect measures can be taken in technology development. Supporters of direct government assistance argue for focusing on promising technologies, while advocates of indirect measures believe the market is superior in deciding which technologies are worthy of investment. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 to address concerns about insufficient investment in science and technology research. The America COMPETES Act responded to this initiative by increasing research funding at various institutions and implementing STEM education programs. The America COMPETES Act, in response to the American Competitiveness Initiative, increased research funding at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science. It also included STEM education programs like Math Now and AP/IB. The Act authorized funding increases for various research organizations and encouraged agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward projects. The America COMPETES Act authorized funding increases for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, encouraging agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward projects. This act also advocated for increased funding for physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science research. The COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for NSF, NIST laboratories, and DOE Office of Science over FY2008-2010, with potential doubling of funding over seven years. Advocates call for increased research funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science based on National Academies' report recommending 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research. The National Academies committee recommends a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. This is necessary due to stagnant federal funding in these fields for the past 15 years, which hinders support for high-potential high-risk research. Corporations are unlikely to fill this gap as they fund little basic research, which is riskier than shareholders are willing to tolerate. The National Academies committee recommends a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. This is necessary due to stagnant federal funding in these fields for the past 15 years. The committee believes that this rate of growth strikes an appropriate balance between the urgency of the issue being addressed and the ability of the research community to apply new funds efficiently. The committee recommends a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual rate for doubling research activities over 10 years. Wide consensus exists on the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness, as highlighted in the National Academies' 2005 report. The National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\" emphasized the importance of increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering to enhance economic competitiveness. The report suggested reallocating existing funds or introducing new funds to support these areas. This led to the American Competitiveness Initiative, which proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of. The American Competitiveness Initiative proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasized NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and STEM education. The act also highlighted the importance of robust funding for NASA to contribute significantly to U.S. goals. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of robust funding for NASA to support basic scientific research, engineering development, and STEM education. Congressional committees are concerned about the balance of funding in the President's FY2008 budget and the insufficient funds for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration. The Senate and House appropriations committees are concerned about the balance of funding in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration. A National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources, and there are questions about the agency's priorities. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the need for robust funding for NASA to support scientific research, engineering development, and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of robust funding for NASA to support scientific research, engineering development, and STEM education. It also highlights the need for NASA to allocate an appropriate percentage of its basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects. This provision aims to address concerns about the agency's priorities and the balance between tasks and resources. The America COMPETES Act high-risk research provision addresses concerns about federal research funding review mechanisms not being open to new, unproven ideas. Transformative research often doesn't fit traditional funding models and faces challenges in review systems dominated by experts invested in current paradigms. Investigators are hesitant to submit radical ideas due to low success rates, prompting the need for change in funding approaches. The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation face challenges in funding transformative research due to limited budgets and low success rates for radical ideas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the need for revolutionary and cutting-edge research, but no dedicated funds are allocated for this purpose. The America COMPETES Act aims to address concerns about traditional funding models not supporting high-risk research. The National Science Foundation is urged to review current practices supporting transformative research and provide reports to Appropriations Committees. $10 million of NSF's budget should be allocated for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in DOE aimed at enhancing economic and energy security through technology development. ARPA-E's goal is to reduce energy imports, greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and lead in advanced energy technologies. ARPA-E aims to enhance the energy security of the United States by developing technologies that reduce foreign energy imports, lower energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency across all sectors, and establish the U.S. as a leader in advanced energy technologies. It follows the DARPA research management model to identify and promote revolutionary advances in fundamental sciences, translate scientific discoveries into technological innovations, and accelerate transformational technological advances in areas where industry may not undertake due to technical and financial uncertainty. ARPA-E is based on the DARPA research management model used by the Department of Defense, focusing on sponsoring revolutionary research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and practical applications. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including the idea of a civilian technology agency for advancing technological innovations in limited areas like energy. Several initiatives have been proposed in the past, such as a civilian technology agency for advancing technological innovations in limited areas like energy. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report recommended the government consider a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies and fuels. Members of the committee that wrote the report suggested ARPA-E should bring excitement and attract top minds to energy research. The National Academies report recommended the creation of ARPA-E to support research on renewable technologies and fuels. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu outlined four objectives for ARPA-E: attract top talent, focus on innovative research, operate efficiently, and bridge the gap between research and implementation. The National Academies report recommended creating ARPA-E to support renewable energy research. ARPA-E would be a nimble organization funding promising projects and bridging gaps between research and industrial innovation. Initial funding was proposed at $300 million, increasing to $1 billion over five to six years for evaluation of effectiveness. Funding for ARPA-E should not jeopardize basic research. The National Academies report recommended creating ARPA-E with initial funding proposed at $300 million, increasing to $1 billion over five to six years for evaluation of effectiveness. Funding for ARPA-E should not jeopardize basic research. Details of ARPA-E's organization and mission should be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Under Secretary for Science in consultation with experts. For more information on ARPA-E, refer to CRS Report RL34497. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations. The institutes, along with their partners, would support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness and train science and engineering students.

The Math Now program aims to enhance math instruction for elementary and middle school students. The Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Program expands access to AP/IB coursework for low-income students by training more high school teachers. Additionally, increased support is provided for existing NSF programs like the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and the Math and Science Partnerships program. The NSF supports various programs to promote STEM education, including Math and Science Partnerships, STEM talent expansion, Advanced Technological Education, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship. These programs aim to increase the number of STEM graduates and improve science and math education at all levels. The America COMPETES Act programs, managed by the DOE and its National Laboratories, aim to improve K-12 STEM education. The Administration opposes some DOE-Managed STEM initiatives, arguing they should not be DOE's responsibility. Proponents believe inspiring children to learn math and science is the key challenge in K-12 STEM education. The DOE manages STEM initiatives like Specialty Schools in Math and Science, Summer Institutes, and National Laboratories Centers of Excellence. There is debate over whether these programs should be DOE's responsibility. Supporters argue that inspiring children to learn math and science is crucial, and interacting with DOE scientists can help achieve this. Specialty schools for math and science are public secondary schools meant to enhance students' academic achievement in STEM subjects. The Administration believes establishing or expanding K-12 schools should not be DOE's responsibility. The Administration argues that establishing or expanding K-12 specialty schools in math and science should not be the responsibility of the DOE. Supporters believe that these schools can serve as a \"nucleus of excellence\" in STEM education, attracting the best students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM subjects. The focus should be on improving existing efforts before starting new initiatives. The COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM subjects. Proponents believe these programs make a remarkable difference in education quality. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education assist teachers in using laboratory equipment to teach courses in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes establishing school-based STEM education centers at DOE national laboratories, believing it would divert resources. Proponents argue that these programs inspire teachers and students, providing necessary resources. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes existing STEM education programs and authorizes one new program, with opposition from the Administration on funding increases. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes existing STEM education programs at the NSF and authorizes a new program. The Administration opposes funding increases for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and the Laboratory Science Pilot program. NSF is responsible for promoting quality math and science education at all levels in the U.S. Increasing qualified K-12 math and science teachers is crucial for competitiveness. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program aims to increase the number of highly qualified K-12 math and science teachers in the U.S. by providing additional funding of $5,000,000 for a total of $15,000,000. This program encourages STEM undergraduate students and professionals to pursue careers in K-12 mathematics and science education. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program provides $15,000,000 to encourage STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers. Students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for teaching in high-need school districts. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program offers scholarships and stipends to STEM students who become math and science teachers in high-need school districts. The program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach, which train teachers in science and math departments rather than education departments. Universities involved in the program use master K-12 teachers as educators and role models. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program aims to train science and mathematics teachers in high-need school districts. Universities involved in the program have shifted their focus to preparing students for education careers, not just research careers. The program also supports the creation of professional science master's degree programs emphasizing practical training for high-need fields. The NSF has authorized a new program to provide grants for institutions to create or improve professional science master's degree programs for practical training in high-need fields. PSM programs aim to meet industry workforce needs by combining advanced science or math training with workplace skills valued by employers. The NSF has authorized a new program to provide grants for institutions to create or improve professional science master's degree programs for practical training in high-need fields. Approximately 120 PSM programs at 60 institutions offer two years of academic training in an emerging or interdisciplinary area, internships, and \"cross-training\" in business and communications. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program would award grants to partnerships to enhance the quality of STEM instruction through improving school laboratories and instrumentation. The program aims to improve school laboratories and STEM instruction by awarding grants to partnerships of educational institutions, agencies, businesses, and nonprofits. It includes professional development for teachers, purchasing equipment, developing instructional programs, and implementing hands-on experiences. A National Research Council report highlighted the poor quality of lab experiences, especially in schools with high concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve STEM education. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program provides grants to increase STEM teachers and improve laboratory facilities. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate labs. The Math Now program aims to enhance math instruction for elementary and middle school students by providing STEM teachers with tools and professional development. The America COMPETES Act includes provisions for establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act directs the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee subcommittee to meet the act's requirements.

Funding for America COMPETES Act programs in FY2008 and FY2009, as well as FY2010 authorization, is summarized in Table 2. Funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act led to funding of several America COMPETES Act programs at the authorized level. For more details, refer to CRS reports RL34736, RL34396, and R40519 by [author name scrubbed]. The combined funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act met the authorized levels for some America COMPETES Act programs, while others were funded below or not at all. The FY2009 appropriation for ARPA-E exceeded the authorized amount, raising questions about future funding levels and potential challenges for sponsored institutions and individuals. The FY2009 appropriation for ARPA-E exceeded the authorized amount, raising questions about future funding levels and potential challenges for sponsored institutions and individuals. The alignment of budget proposals with the America COMPETES Act has been a challenge, with uncertainty about funding for new programs.

The Act provides authorization levels only through FY2010, and it is unclear if these programs will receive the necessary funding to establish them. The America COMPETES Act provides authorization levels only through FY2010. If Congress decides to appropriate funds for the authorized actions, indicators can show how the U.S. economy is faring in terms of competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the U.S.'s top ranking in international competitiveness despite increasing science and technology investments by other countries. Evaluation mechanisms and international rankings assess the nation's ability to compete globally. Evaluation mechanisms and international rankings assess the United States' competitiveness compared to other countries, using inputs, outputs, and outcomes. It is important to note that there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness, as numerous indicators are available but may not provide an accurate assessment. Other factors like necessity or serendipity also play a role in innovation. Innovation assessments involve quantitative evaluations of actions in the innovation process, but combining these indicators may not accurately reflect innovation or a nation's competitiveness. Factors like necessity or serendipity also play a crucial role. Evaluating the quality and impact of innovation is limited and can vary based on perspectives. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee new technologies, and innovation can occur without it due to market demand or minor product changes. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all fund R&D and innovation. Innovation can happen without research and development, driven by market demand or minor product changes. University-industry cooperation is crucial for bridging basic research and industry. The America COMPETES Act focuses on research, while the industrial sector also plays a critical role in technological innovation. University-industry cooperation serves as a liaison between basic research and industry. Analyzing non-defense R&D funding may provide a different perspective on industry R&D investment. Non-defense R&D funding offers a unique perspective on industry investment, considering factors like research versus development spending and funding distribution across industrial sectors. Patent data may not fully capture innovation, as not all outcomes are patentable. The number of scientists and engineers may not accurately reflect a nation's innovative capacity, as new industries can be developed by individuals with or without college degrees. The focus of government policy is on creating an environment where innovation can flourish, leading to competitiveness with other nations. Monitoring and assessing the effects of U.S. policies is crucial for making adjustments as other countries also take steps to enhance their innovation environments. The United States aims to remain competitive by fostering innovation, necessitating monitoring of policies to adjust as other nations enhance their innovation environments.

The report on U.S. competitiveness is submitted to various committees, with mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate outcomes using indicators like the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard. The WEF Global Competitiveness Report rankings are based on publicly available data and an executive opinion survey of business leaders in 131 countries. The OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard report provides information on innovation by regions and industries, innovation strategies by companies, and patterns in trade competitiveness and productivity. Output indicators include the nation's economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. Output indicators such as economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages are monitored by various agencies like the BEA, BLS, U.S. Census Bureau, and NSF. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report. Input indicators like quality of education, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are also monitored. These reports provide valuable insights into the health of the science and engineering enterprise. The BEA, on behalf of NSF, is analyzing the impact of R&D on GDP growth. Input indicators like education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are being studied. Reports monitor these indicators to identify policy areas for improvement. The United States ranks high in overall competitiveness but not in all input/output indicators. Sub-indicators related to the America COMPETES Act programs show the U.S. ranking out of 131 countries. The America COMPETES Act programs are analyzed in relation to key sub-indicators like quality of education, innovation capacity, and availability of scientists and engineers.
