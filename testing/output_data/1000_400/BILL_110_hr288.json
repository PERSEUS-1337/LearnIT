    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for individuals eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. This amendment ensures that the primary insurance amount is adjusted to include a transitional increase amount for qualifying individuals. The amendment to Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act provides for a transitional increase amount for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. This increase amount is calculated based on the excess under former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year of eligibility. The transitional increase amount for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989 is determined by the applicable percentage based on the year of eligibility. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and their primary insurance amount calculated under current law. The \"former law primary insurance amount\" is the amount calculated based on the laws in effect in December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d), with modifications. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply, and only calendar years after a certain period are considered in the computation. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on laws in effect in December 1978, with specific considerations for computation base years and adjustments to the former law primary insurance amount. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on laws in effect in December 1978, with specific considerations for computation base years and adjustments to the former law primary insurance amount. This paragraph applies to individuals whose wages and self-employment income are the largest after a certain period, with adjustments made to ensure a greater primary insurance amount than computed under a different paragraph. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 based on certain criteria. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act for December 2006, based on specific criteria outlined in the Social Security Amendments of 1977."
