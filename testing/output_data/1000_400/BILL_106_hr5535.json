    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" mandates that a minimum of 10 percent of engineering research grants from the National Science Foundation be allocated for coastal engineering and shoreline protection research starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas are established. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose to undertake artificial reefs and aquatic habitat restoration projects instead of paying fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. The amendment allows publicly owned shores with insufficient public access to be considered privately owned for eligibility in shoreline protection projects and cost sharing. The Development Act of 1986 is amended to include publicly owned shores with insufficient public access in the definition of privately owned shores for shoreline protection projects. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore assisted by the Secretary, with exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund for beach nourishment projects without the need for further appropriation. Funds in the Beach Nourishment Account are available for specific purposes without further appropriation. The Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of NASA, and the Secretary of the Army can access these funds for authorized projects. The funds remain available until expended, and the Secretary of the Army must adhere to cost-sharing requirements for beach nourishment projects. The Secretary of the Army must carry out beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects using funds from the Beach Nourishment Account, following cost-sharing requirements. Transactions must be reported to Congress annually, and any excess funds not needed for current withdrawals must be invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest excess funds from the Beach Nourishment Account in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any obligations acquired can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited back to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways for real-time availability. Data collected will include wave heights, periods, swell direction, and water temperature. The pilot program will collect information on coastal oceans and inland waterways in real-time, including wave heights, water temperature, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion, weather, and river mouth sediment observation. Federal cooperation is required for the program. The pilot program will collect real-time data on coastal oceans and inland waterways, including wave heights, water temperature, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion, weather, and river mouth sediment observation. Federal cooperation with the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency is required. Two regional test projects will be established, one in Southern California Bight and the other at a location to be determined. The Secretary and the Administrator will establish 2 regional test projects, one in Southern California Bight and the other at a location to be determined. They will coordinate existing efforts in monitoring ocean conditions and seek to obtain additional information. $4,000,000 will be available annually from the Beach Nourishment Account for this program from 2001 to 2006. Authorization of Appropriations: $4,000,000 annually from 2001 to 2006 will be available for 2 regional test projects to monitor ocean conditions and gather additional information."
