However, Al Qaeda's survival, regional affiliates' strength, and appeal among some Muslims remain challenges. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities, reactions, and policy mistakes. Recent trends show increased ideological outreach online and promotion of low-cost operations by individuals with limited terrorist network linkages, complicating counterterrorism efforts. Recent events indicate that Al Qaeda supporters are using the Internet for sophisticated ideological outreach and promoting independent, low-cost operations by individuals with limited ties to established terrorist networks. This trend could complicate U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts by spreading Al Qaeda's ideology and making terrorism threats less predictable and harder to disrupt.
