    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, officials, and historians. The CWRIC concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was not justified by military necessity, but rather driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. This led to a grave personal injustice for American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, declaring it a great day for America. The Congress also declared their findings in the act. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry during WWII, apologizing for the violation of their civil liberties and constitutional rights. This apology is in response to actions motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria, resulting in significant human suffering and damages.
