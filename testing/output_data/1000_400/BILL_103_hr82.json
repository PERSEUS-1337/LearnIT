    "content": "Restoration of deduction for interest on educational loans. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the deduction of interest on qualified educational loans. This includes loans provided through federal, state, or state-based guarantee programs. The term 'qualified educational loan' includes indebtedness provided through federal, state, or state-based guarantee programs, by a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3), or by a financial institution under a supplemental education program. The qualified educational loan can be incurred through a financial institution under a supplemental education program, with repayments made to the educational institution. The loan must be used for qualified educational expenses within a reasonable timeframe. The amount of interest eligible for deduction may be reduced based on income level. The amount of interest eligible for deduction may be reduced based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year. The deduction for interest is subject to phaseout based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year. The applicable dollar amount and phaseout range vary depending on filing status, with a deduction allowable only for the first 48 months. The deduction for interest is subject to phaseout based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The applicable dollar amount is $60,000 with a phaseout range of $30,000. The deduction is only allowable for the first 48 months of loan repayment. Qualified educational expenses include tuition and related expenses. The term 'qualified educational expenses' refers to tuition and related expenses for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependent attending an eligible educational institution. The term 'qualified tuition and related expenses' includes reasonable living expenses while away from home and the phaseout amounts are adjusted for inflation after 1994. In 1994, the $40,000 and $60,000 amounts in subparagraph (B) will be increased based on the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. Amounts will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50 if not already a multiple. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1993, for loans with the first required payment after that date. Amounts adjusted will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50."
