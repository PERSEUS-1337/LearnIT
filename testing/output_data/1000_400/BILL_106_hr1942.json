The Congress finds that free trade agreements improve income and prosperity by increasing competition, reducing costs, and creating new opportunities for trade and investment. APEC member economies aim for \"free and open trade\" by 2020 for developing countries and 2010 for developed countries, promoting economic growth and stability by reducing tariffs and nontariff barriers. Continued economic growth and stability in the Pacific Rim region are crucial for the United States, especially in light of the financial crisis in Asia. The disruption in trade patterns from 1989-1997 highlights the importance of reducing trade barriers and fostering opportunities for investment. The disruption in trade patterns from 1989-1997 emphasizes the need to reduce trade barriers and promote investment opportunities. Free trade agreement negotiations offer leverage to open markets for US goods and services, especially during challenging economic times. Strengthening ties with allies like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore, who support trade liberalization, is crucial for economic growth in the Pacific Rim region. Building closer ties and coordinating with countries like Australia and Singapore, who are long-time allies of the United States in promoting economic growth through trade liberalization, will be beneficial as trade negotiations proceed in the Asia-Pacific region.
