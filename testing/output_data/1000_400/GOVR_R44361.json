    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement as part of its Asia-Pacific strategy. The agreement was concluded in late 2015, signed in February 2016, and aims to liberalize trade among 12 countries. Congress played an active role in the negotiations, and implementing legislation would be required for the TPP to take effect in the U.S. The TPP negotiations involved Congress oversight, consultations, and formal negotiating objectives. Implementing legislation would be needed for the agreement to take effect in the U.S. The strategic significance of the TPP is a topic of debate in Congress, with proponents highlighting its economic and strategic importance for U.S. policy in the region and beyond. The TPP's strategic importance lies in the United States using the agreement to exert influence in the region and beyond, strengthening alliances, maintaining leadership in the Asia-Pacific, enhancing national security, promoting trade liberalization and economic growth, and establishing trade rules consistent with U.S. interests. The TPP aims to maintain U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, promote trade liberalization, drive economic growth, and establish trade rules. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are crucial factors in the analysis of U.S. influence in the area. China's rapid economic growth has positioned it as a key trade partner in Asia, leading to initiatives that some view as an attempt to reduce U.S. influence. The TPP is seen as a way to maintain U.S. leadership in the region and establish trade norms, with debates on whether it should be framed as countering Chinese efforts. The TPP is viewed as a means to uphold U.S. leadership in Asia and set trade rules with consideration for China. Some argue against framing it as a counter to Chinese initiatives, suggesting mutual benefits in trade liberalization goals. Balancing economic and political aspects, policymakers face challenges in supporting the TPP. Critics believe focusing on strategic aspects detracts from evaluating the agreement based on its main criteria. The TPP is a complex agreement that involves economic and political elements, creating tension for policymakers who may support it for different reasons. Critics argue that the focus on strategic aspects distracts from evaluating its impact on the U.S. economy. Proponents emphasize the broader strategic implications, which can be challenging to quantify. This report will analyze strategic arguments for and against the TPP in the Asia-Pacific region. The report examines strategic arguments for and against the TPP in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on implications for Asia and potential future legislation. The United States has a history of advancing trade agreements like FTAs to promote foreign policy goals. Since the end of World War II, the United States has utilized trade agreements like FTAs to advance its foreign policy goals. FTAs with countries like Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman have been seen as not just economic but also security and foreign policy measures, aimed at enhancing cooperation in combating terrorism. The first U.S. FTA in Asia was with Singapore in 2004, emphasizing strategic interests in liberalizing trade. The Obama Administration and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade initiatives in Asia, particularly the TPP, hold significant geostrategic importance. The Obama Administration and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade initiatives in Asia, particularly the TPP, hold significant geostrategic importance. The Administration's 2015 National Security Strategy emphasized the need to shape a global economic order reflecting U.S. interests and values. TPP is seen as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader and is the Obama Administration's signature economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP is a key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, seen as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. Its approval by Congress is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership role in Asia and signal active integration into the region's economic and diplomatic structures. The TPP is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership role in Asia and signal active integration into the region's economic and diplomatic structures. Administration officials argue that the agreement is a key signal of U.S. integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, with many in the Asia-Pacific region echoing these sentiments. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP in May 2015, stating that failing to finalize the agreement would damage the credibility of the U.S. globally. Proponents believe that the TPP is essential for strengthening regional institutions and promoting cooperation through respect for rules and norms. The TPP is seen as crucial for promoting global stability and prosperity through adherence to international rules and norms. Proponents argue that the agreement will strengthen alliances and partnerships in East Asia, with Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter likening its importance to that of an aircraft carrier. However, specific security rationales for supporting the TPP are not always clearly articulated. \"Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of passing TPP, comparing it to another aircraft carrier. Proponents believe the agreement will reinforce U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics argue that security partnerships are more influenced by countries' security interests rather than trade agreements.\" The impact of trade agreements like the KORUS FTA and TPP on security alliances in East Asia is debated, with many arguing that security partnerships are more influenced by countries' security interests rather than trade agreements. Japan's strategic cooperation with the United States is driven by its own calculations, indicating that the future of alliances is determined by factors like perception of threats from China or North Korea. The TPP may have a larger impact on countries with which the U.S. relationship is not as close, such as Vietnam. A successful outcome in the TPP negotiations could support reform-oriented decisionmakers in Vietnam by requiring deeper market-oriented institutional changes. Many Vietnamese leaders would see TPP approval as a sign of closer ties and more normal relations with the United States. The TPP approval by Vietnam could signal closer ties with the United States and support market-oriented institutional changes. Failure to approve the agreement may impact Vietnam's perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner. TPP proponents believe it will help promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values. The TPP agreement, according to Defense Secretary Carter, aims to promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values. It is believed that the trade rules in the TPP could indirectly impact U.S. security relationships by signaling key partnerships with participating countries. Approving and implementing the TPP would help solidify the United States' presence in the Pacific region. Implementing the TPP would help secure the United States' Pacific presence and signal key partnerships with participating countries, showing a commitment to the region. Failure to approve the TPP could be interpreted by Asian policymakers as a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in the Pacific. A failed TPP in the United States could be seen as a symbol of declining interest and leadership in the region, potentially creating an influence vacuum that China may fill. U.S. credibility in Asia is already in question, especially with China's rise and North Korea's threats challenging U.S. influence. Rejection of the TPP could lead to strained relationships and loss of trust between the United States and key partners like Japan. The rejection of the TPP in the United States could lead to strained relationships and loss of trust between the United States and key partners like Japan. North Korea's growing nuclear and missile capabilities are challenging U.S. influence, and the TPP may have implications for U.S. influence on regional and global trade efforts. Proponents argue that the rules established in the TPP will promote economic growth and advance U.S. interests. U.S. influence on regional and global trade efforts through the TPP aims to promote economic growth, advance U.S. interests, encourage market opening and reforms, create incentives for Asia-Pacific nations to follow suit, address trade barriers, update trade rules, and influence future negotiations at the WTO or FTAs. The goal is to update the rules-based trading system. Through new trade rules and disciplines, the United States aims to update critical gaps in existing trade rules and influence future multilateral or plurilateral negotiations at the WTO or FTAs. Central to U.S. negotiating objectives in the TPP is the goal to update the rules-based trading system, building on its historical role in expanding economic engagement through trade. The United States played a key role in liberalizing trade through GATT and establishing the WTO. However, the current WTO Doha Round has stalled due to member differences. With advancements in technology, new trade rules are needed to address digital trade and state-owned enterprises. As a result, the US is pursuing bilateral and regional agreements to further liberalize trade. The current multilateral trade rules do not address critical aspects of today's trading environment, leading countries like the United States to pursue new trade rules through agreements like the TPP. The TPP creates an economically significant bloc of nations, accounting for 37% of U.S. trade and global GDP. The agreement is open to new countries willing to adhere to its provisions, potentially aiding domestic reform efforts in emerging economies. The TPP's economic significance could grow as the agreement is open to new countries willing to adhere to its provisions. In some emerging economies, the TPP could provide political cover for domestic reform agendas, promoting U.S. goals such as worker rights and environmental protection. Proponents argue that the TPP will create competitive pressure for non-participating countries, expanding its reach. Proponents argue that the implemented TPP will draw interest from other countries, creating competitive pressure for non-participating countries and potentially expanding the reach of its rules. However, the TPP does not include some of Asia's largest economies like China, India, and Indonesia, limiting its comprehensive impact on trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. Some experts argue that the TPP, as it stands, excludes key Asian economies like China, India, and Indonesia, limiting its impact on trade in the region. However, there is potential for growth as countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand have shown interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members. Taiwan is also interested in membership, but domestic opposition remains a challenge for many Asian nations. Many Asian nations, including Taiwan, have shown interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members. Countries like South Korea and Colombia are likely candidates for TPP entry. Proponents believe mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could influence multilateral negotiations beyond existing WTO commitments. Proponents of mega-regionals like the TPP and T-TIP argue that their economic significance could influence multilateral negotiations beyond existing WTO commitments. Critics fear that focusing on bilateral and regional trade deals may hinder multilateral initiatives, potentially undermining the WTO's role in global trade policy. The shift away from WTO trade negotiations towards mega-regionals like the TPP could undermine the organization's legitimacy and role in future trade liberalization. This could lead to overlapping and differing rules, complicating the trading system. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a significant trade negotiation in the Asia-Pacific region, involving ASEAN members and six other nations. Unlike the TPP, the United States is not part of RCEP negotiations. Potential differences between RCEP and TPP can be seen in the comparison of ASEAN trade agreements and finalized TPP components. The United States does not have an FTA with ASEAN and has not shown interest in joining RCEP negotiations. A comparison of ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP indicates potential differences, with the TPP being more comprehensive in terms of trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, and labor and environmental provisions. RCEP may present an alternative or challenge to U.S. efforts through the TPP, as it may not address disciplines on state-owned enterprises like the TPP does. RCEP, a regional trade agreement, may present a challenge to U.S. efforts through the TPP. Some argue that both agreements can be complementary and lead to economic growth in the region. The timing of negotiations for TPP and RCEP will determine their impact on the existing trade architecture. The TPP and RCEP are regional undertakings that may affect the existing trade architecture in the region. The timing of negotiations for both agreements will determine their impact. All 12 TPP countries and 11 RCEP countries are also members of the APEC forum, which aims for open and free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. A broad Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) has been discussed by APEC members since 2006, supported by China and the United States. The APEC forum aims for open and free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. China and the United States support the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). The TPP and RCEP are seen as possible pathways to the FTAAP. China's inclusion in the TPP may have significant implications for the United States and the region. China's potential inclusion in the TPP could impact the United States and the Asia-Pacific region due to its growing international influence. Some argue that China is trying to minimize U.S. presence and power in the region, making the TPP necessary to counter this effort. The proposed TPP aims to shape a regional economic model that aligns with U.S. interests. Decades of expanding Chinese trade and investment, along with new initiatives in the region, have created a vision of regional economic development different from the U.S. The proposed TPP aims to shape a model in line with U.S. interests by creating enforceable standards and norms. This could potentially influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions in favor of U.S. interests. President Obama emphasized the importance of enforceable labor and environmental standards, IP protections, and non-discrimination in the TPP. The TPP aims to influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions in favor of U.S. interests by creating enforceable standards and norms. President Obama highlighted the importance of labor and environmental standards, IP protections, and non-discrimination in the agreement. A completed TPP could also push China to further liberalize its economic and trade regime to potentially join the agreement and encourage deeper reforms. China may further liberalize its economic and trade regime to potentially join the TPP, providing political cover for reformers in China. Arguments suggest that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may overstate its influence on regional trade rules. Concerns include the possibility of China reacting negatively if it perceives the TPP as a tool to constrain its interests. Additionally, China's economic initiatives could benefit other Asian countries, potentially leading them to view the U.S. as opposing progress. China's economic initiatives in Asia may be seen as beneficial for regional development, potentially leading to the perception of the U.S. as obstructionist. Asian nations are unlikely to adopt policies that go against their interests, whether they are American, Chinese, or otherwise. China's leaders aim to strengthen their nation economically and politically, viewing these goals as dependent on a strong economy. China's leaders are focused on transforming China into a prosperous major power through a strong economy, defense, and global role. They are implementing policies to boost the economy and expand global economic integration, including the One Belt, One Road initiative to enhance trade and development links with Europe, the Middle East, central Asia, and Southeast Asia. China is constructing the Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road, known as \"One Belt, One Road,\" to create new trade linkages. New financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Silk Road Fund aim to finance this initiative. China is also increasing the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, to support Chinese assistance programs and enhance its global economic stature. China's efforts to increase the overseas use of the renminbi aim to simplify transactions for Chinese financial institutions, reduce commercial risks for Chinese companies in international trade, and enhance China's global economic influence. Chinese leaders are also working towards establishing regional rules and norms through initiatives like RCEP and promoting reforms in multilateral institutions like the UN, IMF, and World Bank, with the AIIB offering an alternative model for development banks. China is actively promoting reforms in international institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, with the establishment of the AIIB as an alternative model for development banks. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are matched by diplomatic and security actions to reduce U.S. influence. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are matched by actions in the diplomatic and security spheres to counter U.S. influence. China is attempting to refashion CICA into a new Asian security system and has undertaken construction in the South China Sea to counter U.S. naval power. China's views on the TPP have varied over time, especially as more countries joined the negotiations. China is taking actions in the South China Sea to counter U.S. naval power and has varied views on the TPP, with some seeing it as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. President Obama clarified that the TPP is not meant to contain or disadvantage China, and hopes China will adopt fair practices. In December 2014, President Obama clarified that the TPP is not aimed at containing or disadvantaging China. China's criticisms softened after Japan joined TPP talks in April 2013. Chinese officials expressed interest in joining TPP, stating it can foster a fair international trade order. U.S. officials welcome China to join TPP. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated in November 2014 that China is open to negotiations on the TPP. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP, although Chinese officials have expressed concerns about implementing the standards and provisions of the agreement. President Obama mentioned in June 2015 that China had shown interest in participating in the TPP. Analysts believe that the U.S. aims to integrate China more deeply into trade liberalization and establish new trade rules not covered by the WTO. The United States aims to integrate China more fully into trade liberalization through the TPP. Analysts believe that high-standard agreements like the TPP could subject China to new rules and discourage it from weakening existing trade rules. The US is also negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially facilitate China's future participation in the TPP. Congress has been directly involved in guiding and overseeing the TPP negotiations since the US joined in 2008. The United States is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially facilitate China's future participation in the TPP. Congress approved legislation in 2015 to establish trade negotiating objectives and expedite consideration of trade agreements. Congress will have a direct role in considering TPP and implementing legislation. Key issues for Congress to consider include whether TPP furthers a broader foreign policy strategy. The TPP agreement, if approved, could further U.S. diplomatic and security goals in the Asia-Pacific region by promoting respect for international rules and norms. It aims to reinforce U.S. leadership, encourage economic and political reform, and garner support from Asia-Pacific nations. The TPP agreement aims to promote respect for international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging economic and political reform. Congress should consider the strategic implications of the agreement and its broader foreign policy strategy. The TPP agreement's strategic implications and potential membership expansion are key considerations for Congress. The agreement aims to promote international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership. The TPP agreement's strategic implications and potential membership expansion are key considerations for Congress. Some argue that the TPP is crucial for U.S. leadership in Asia, while others question if it strikes the right balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. Failed ratification could impact U.S. leadership in the region. The TPP agreement's strategic implications and potential membership expansion are key considerations for Congress. Failed ratification could impact U.S. leadership in the region by setting back goals and affecting views on U.S. leadership and credibility. The failure to ratify the TPP could impact U.S. leadership in the region and affect views on credibility. Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region are pursuing their own trade arrangements, prompting the need for the U.S. to reinforce economic engagement beyond TPP membership. Congress should consider if current U.S. economic initiatives in Asia are sufficient for broader goals. The United States should enunciate strategies to reinforce economic engagement in the Asia-Pacific region beyond TPP membership. Congress should consider if existing initiatives are enough to further U.S. influence and whether other initiatives are needed. Analysts have mixed views on how mega-regional negotiations may impact the multilateral trading system. The United States should consider strategies to strengthen economic engagement in the Asia-Pacific region beyond TPP membership. Analysts have mixed views on how mega-regional negotiations may affect the multilateral trading system, with concerns about potential impacts on the WTO and global trade liberalization. Congress may need to assess the implications of expanding TPP to include other countries and whether it will support or fragment the global trading system. The proposed TPP may impact global trade discussions and the WTO. Congress should consider if it will promote multilateral trade liberalization or lead to fragmentation. They may need to explore new global trade initiatives to ensure the TPP aligns with global trade goals."
