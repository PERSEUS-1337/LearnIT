    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, with a maximum credit amount of 2.3 cents per kWh for 2013-2016 and 2.4 cents per kWh for 2017-2018. Different technologies qualify for varying credit amounts, with wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy technologies eligible for the maximum credit. Under current law, nonwind facilities may qualify for the PTC if construction began before January 1, 2018, while wind facilities must begin construction before January 1, 2020. The credit amount varies for different technologies, with some qualifying for the maximum credit and others for a reduced amount. The credit is reduced by 20% for facilities that began construction in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 60% in 2019. Before 2013, the PTC expiration date was based on a placed-in-service deadline. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for nonwind facilities that started construction before January 1, 2018, and for wind facilities before January 1, 2020. The credit amount varies for different technologies, with reductions of 20% in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 60% in 2019. The PTC may phase out if electricity market prices exceed threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. The PTC was also limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) before 2018. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has not been phased out due to electricity market prices not exceeding threshold levels. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), which was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) from 2009 to 2017. The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers could claim the 30% energy investment tax credit from 2009 to 2017. There are also production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific placed-in-service requirements. The production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal have specific placed-in-service requirements. Indian coal has a base rate of $2.00 per ton, with a 2017 credit of $2.4 per ton. Refined coal has a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton, with a 2018 credit of $7.307 per ton. The PTC was first enacted in 1992 and has been extended 11 times since 1999. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 and has been extended 11 times since 1999. The PTC was available for wind or closed-loop biomass systems initially and has been extended multiple times with additional qualifying technologies like poultry waste. The PTC has specific placed-in-service requirements for Indian coal and refined coal facilities. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since 1999, with new qualifying technologies added such as poultry waste. Legislation in the 108th Congress expanded the PTC to include resources like open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources were limited to a five-year production period instead of the previous 10 years. The AJCA of 2004 added new qualifying resources to the Production Tax Credit (PTC), including open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These resources were limited to a five-year PTC period, with some credits reduced by half. The AJCA also introduced a PTC for refined coal. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the PTC for most facilities for two years, except for solar energy and refined coal. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended twice during the 109th Congress. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the PTC for most facilities for two years, except for solar energy and refined coal. It also added hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources, with Indian coal qualifying for a credit over a seven-year period. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 further extended the PTC for one year, through 2008, for all qualifying facilities. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended multiple times, with adjustments made to the credit period and qualifying resources. The PTC was extended for wind and refined coal for one year in 2008, and for closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower for two years in 2009. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were also added as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2009 for wind and refined coal, and through 2010 for closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EESA) added marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel. The credit for steel industry fuel was set at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent and had specific eligibility criteria based on the date of facility operation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits for property placed in service in 2009 or 2010. The Section 1603 grant program, introduced under ARRA, allowed taxpayers to receive a one-time payment in lieu of tax credits for property placed in service in 2009 or 2010. The program was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which also changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and ITC options were retroactively extended through 2014. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which also changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and ITC options were retroactively extended through 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through the end of 2016, along with the ITC option. Indian coal facilities also saw an extension of the production credit through 2016. The PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities was extended through 2016, along with the ITC option. Indian coal facilities also had their production credit extended through 2016. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019, with reduced credits for facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were retroactively extended for tax year 2017. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was extended through 2016. For wind facilities, the credit was extended through 2019 with reduced credits for construction starting in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were retroactively extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses for the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are $25.8 billion, with wind energy accounting for the majority at $24.0 billion. Other PTCs include $0.8 billion for geothermal, $0.5 billion for open-loop biomass, $0.3 billion for municipal solid waste, and $0.1 billion for qualified hydropower. Additionally, production credits for refined coal and Indian coal each result in $0.1 billion in revenue losses over the same period. The estimated revenue losses associated with the Production Tax Credit (PTC) between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with wind energy accounting for $24.0 billion. Other PTCs include $0.8 billion for geothermal, $0.5 billion for open-loop biomass, $0.3 billion for municipal solid waste, and $0.1 billion for qualified hydropower. Additionally, production credits for refined coal and Indian coal each result in $0.1 billion in revenue losses over the same period. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law, with 230 corporate taxpayers claiming PTCs totaling $2.8 billion in 2013. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the Production Tax Credit (PTC) totaling $2.8 billion, mainly for renewable electricity production. Taxpayers can carry forward unused credits to offset tax liability in future years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected the number of PTC claims, which increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009. In 2010, $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants were claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn also led to a significant increase in tax credit carry forwards. The economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims, with a significant increase in tax credit carry forwards. The cost of a long-term PTC extension is estimated to reduce revenues by $1.4 billion for nonwind technologies and $0.4 billion for the Indian Coal Production Credit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The PTC was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, and its extension in 1999 was seen as important for environmentally friendly power development. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, with a 1999 extension to assess its effectiveness. Congress extended the PTC to further develop wind and other resources, believing it contributes to renewable energy infrastructure growth. Research shows the PTC drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions are often provided. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions have limitations. Research on its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. In a 2013 report, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small (0.3%) increase in power-sector emissions. The recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Government intervention in energy markets is often justified by the presence of externalities, such as pollution, which create market failures. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option for addressing market failures in the energy sector caused by externalities like pollution. However, subsidies may not be the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective as they can encourage energy consumption, counter conservation efforts, and offset emissions reductions. Additionally, subsidies do not provide a comparable incentive for all emissions reduction efforts. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources may not be the most efficient way to address market failures in the energy sector. They reduce energy costs, leading to increased consumption, counteracting conservation efforts, and offsetting emissions reductions. Tax subsidies also do not provide equal incentives for all emissions reduction alternatives and can favor more costly reductions. Instead, a direct tax on pollution, like a carbon tax, would be a more economically efficient approach, generating revenue to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. A more direct and economically efficient approach to addressing pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector would be a carbon tax. This option would generate revenues to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy projects, as they often rely on outside investors to monetize tax benefits. Financial support for renewable energy is often provided through tax-equity financing arrangements with outside investors. Tax incentives that reward production can lead to more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies, reducing compliance costs. Legislative action is needed to address these issues. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies, reducing compliance costs. Options for the PTC include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with an extended construction start date deadline. Options for the Production Tax Credit (PTC) include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with an extended construction start date deadline. Congress may choose to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies, potentially retroactive for 2018, and remove the phaseout for wind to have all PTC-eligible technologies qualify at the same rate. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for nonwind technologies could be extended, with the possibility of applying the phaseout to other technologies. Alternatively, the PTC for nonwind technologies could be extended while removing the phaseout for wind, allowing all PTC-eligible technologies to qualify at the same rate. In 2014, a proposal was made to eliminate the PTC inflation adjustment factor, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for properties within the 10-year eligibility window. The proposal aimed to reduce the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would result in a significant decrease from the previous 2.3 cents per kWh PTC. The plan also included a full repeal of the PTC after 2024, with estimated additional federal revenues of $9.6 billion between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget suggested a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and adding solar facilities as qualifying properties. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for renewable energy, costing $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026. Solar facilities would be added as qualifying property, and the PTC would be made refundable. Additionally, renewable electricity consumed by the producer could qualify for tax credits, and solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC."
