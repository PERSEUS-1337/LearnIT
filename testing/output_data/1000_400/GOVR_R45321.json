    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, an increase over the Administration's request. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT in FY2019. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill, a 1.8% increase over FY2018. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT, slightly above FY2018 levels. The House committee bill for FY2019 would maintain level inflation-adjusted funding for DOT compared to FY2018, while the Senate bill may slightly reduce funding. DOT's funding is unique as most comes from mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with grants to states and local governments. About two-thirds to three-fourths of DOT's funding is mandatory, while one-third to one-fourth is discretionary. Around two-thirds to three-fourths of DOT's funding is mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with one-third to one-fourth being discretionary. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding, changing the proportion of funding sources. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund's funding is categorized as discretionary budget authority and combined with general fund discretionary authority. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget primarily focused on operations. Trust funds, funded by taxes, support most of DOT's budget, with periodic reauthorizations necessary. The Department of Transportation's budget is mainly funded by trust funds supported by taxes, with reauthorizations of these taxes being crucial for funding DOT programs. While highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, the federal aviation programs face expiration in September 2018. DOT's nonemergency funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal terms, but adjusting for inflation shows a different trend. The Department of Transportation's budget, funded by trust funds supported by taxes, faces reauthorization challenges. DOT's nonemergency funding has risen from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal terms. However, adjusting for inflation, funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. Real funding in FY2016 and FY2017 was similar to FY2006, but lower than the FY2007-FY2011 period. Federal highway and transit funding mainly come from the Highway Trust Fund. In FY2016 and FY2017, DOT's inflation-adjusted funding was lower than FY2007-FY2011. Most federal highway and transit funding come from the Highway Trust Fund, supported by the gas tax. The fund has faced shortfalls, leading to transfers from the general Treasury fund. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund faces a shortfall due to the federal gas tax not being raised since 1993. The tax is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, leading to a decrease in revenue due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency. Congress has transferred funds from the Treasury to keep the trust fund solvent. The gas tax has not been raised since 1993, leading to a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. Inflation and increased fuel efficiency have reduced the tax's value. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption through 2024, resulting in revenues below projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for infrastructure grants in FY2018. CBO projects annual Highway Trust Fund revenues of $39-41 billion from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for infrastructure grants in FY2018, known as BUILD Transportation grants. The Senate recommended $1 billion, emphasizing that DOT cannot prioritize projects based on federal funding requests. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed the Department of Transportation (DOT) to use specific selection criteria for grants, prohibiting the use of an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources. The TIGER grant program aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution by providing discretionary grants for projects with national or regional impacts. An example is the Amtrak's Gateway Program focused on the Northeast Corridor rail line. The Gateway Program, including the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River, faces challenges due to funding distribution based on transportation modes. The burden of paying for the $13 billion-plus project falls on New York and New Jersey, impacting Amtrak passengers from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA. The burden of funding the $13 billion-plus Gateway Program, including the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River, falls on New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with funding mainly going towards regional and metropolitan projects. Congress aims for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes, with low minimum grant thresholds. The BUILD/TIGER program focuses on regional and metropolitan projects, with Congress aiming for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes. The program is oversubscribed, with critics previously arguing that grants disproportionately favored urban areas. Congress has directed that a portion of funding should go to rural areas, with minimum grant thresholds set at $5 million for urban projects and $1 million for rural projects. In the past, critics argued that TIGER grants favored urban areas, leading Congress to allocate a portion of funding to rural areas. The House Appropriations Committee now recommends 33% of funding for rural projects, with an emphasis on bridge projects. Additionally, 33% is designated for projects near major seaports, and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The House Appropriations Committee recommends allocating 33% of funding for rural bridge projects, 33% for projects near major seaports, and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a pattern where the Obama Administration requests more funding, the House proposes cuts, the Senate proposes a similar amount to previous appropriations, and Congress agrees on a final amount. This pattern is seen in the FY2019 appropriations bills as well. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with an estimated $140 million for FY2019. The program is financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by the FAA, which apply to international flights passing through U.S. airspace. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS in FY2019. The FAA collects overflight fees from commercial airlines for international flights passing through U.S. airspace. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019. The House committee bill recommended $175 million in discretionary appropriation, while the Senate-passed bill also recommends the same amount. This would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The EAS program aims to maintain commercial air service to small communities. The bill recommends a $175 million discretionary appropriation for the EAS program, resulting in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The cost of the program has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions and new community additions. Congress made changes in 2012 to limit subsidies and allow smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. Congress made changes to the Essential Air Service (EAS) program in 2012, including capping subsidies at $1,000 per passenger for communities, limiting subsidies to $200 per passenger for communities less than 210 miles from a hub airport, and allowing smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. Supporters argue that the program preserves airline service to small communities as promised during airline deregulation in 1978, while critics point out the high subsidy cost per passenger and low passenger numbers at many airports in the program. Supporters argue that subsidizing air service to smaller communities promotes economic development in rural areas, while critics note the high subsidy cost per passenger and low passenger numbers at many airports in the Essential Air Service (EAS) program. In 2008, Congress directed railroads to install positive train control (PTC) to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, but most required track was not compliant by the 2015 deadline. Positive Train Control (PTC) is a communication system aimed at preventing train incidents due to operator or dispatcher errors. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required track did not have PTC installed by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for railroads to extend to 2020 with approval. Funding has been provided by Congress in recent years, but the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement grant program. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include funding for PTC implementation. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement grant program. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak with changes to its federal grants structure. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak with changes to its federal grants structure, creating separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. Three new grant programs were authorized for intercity passenger rail development. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, allocated to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $800 million for two new grant programs. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects in grant-making. Congress has historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects in grant-making. Congress historically provided minimal funding for intercity passenger rail, with exceptions in FY2009 and FY2010. Funding for intercity passenger rail development was absent from FY2011 to FY2016, except for PTC implementation projects. In FY2017, Congress allocated $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs. From FY2011 to FY2016, Congress provided no funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for PTC implementation. In FY2017, $98 million was allocated for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes the majority of its $13 billion funding to state and local transit agencies through formula-based programs. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as the New Starts program, is the largest discretionary transit grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as the New Starts program, funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. The Capital Investment Grants program includes New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. The program also offers an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over several years, with a significant portion allocated to projects with multiyear grant agreements signed in previous years. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, a decrease from the $2.645 billion provided in FY2018. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, a decrease from the $2.645 billion provided in FY2018. Congress expressed concern about the Administration's approach to the CIG program, which focuses on funding projects with existing grant agreements. In FY2019, Congress provided $2.614 billion for Capital Investment Grants, slightly less than the FY2018 amount. The Senate-passed bill would allocate $2.553 billion. The Administration's stance on transit projects has raised concerns, as it believes state and local governments should fund them without federal assistance. Congress has not supported this proposal and has provided more funding than requested for the CIG program in FY2018. The Administration has not requested federal funding for new transit projects in FY2018 or FY2019. Congress has provided more funding than requested for the CIG program, directing FTA to advance eligible projects through the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlights FTA's failure to comply with congressional directives for CIG program improvements. The Senate Appropriations Committee report criticizes FTA for not complying with congressional directives to improve the CIG program and expresses concern about unnecessary delays in project development. Transportation for America accuses FTA of deliberately delaying transit projects despite Congress providing funding for them. Transportation for America accuses FTA of deliberately delaying transit projects despite Congress providing funding for them, resulting in increased costs and expired construction bids. FTA denies the allegations of project delays. One alleged result is that project sponsors are facing increased costs due to lengthened process; bids for construction have expired before FTA completed its review, forcing agencies to rebid projects. FTA denies delaying project review process. New Starts grant can be up to 80% of net capital project cost. DOT appropriations acts have limited federal share for New Starts projects, with FY2018 limit at 51%. Critics argue federal share for New Starts projects should not be lower than 50%. The House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision lowering the federal share for New Starts grant agreements to 50%, while the Senate-passed bill does not have this provision. Critics argue that the lower federal share makes highway projects more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates of the provision argue that it allows FTA to support more projects and encourages communities to carefully consider the costs and benefits of transit projects. Advocates argue that requiring a higher local match for New Starts funding allows FTA to support more projects and encourages careful cost-benefit analysis. Challenges in funding transportation infrastructure include the distribution of federal funding by mode, making it difficult for projects involving multiple modes to secure significant federal funding. Congress provides around $55 billion annually for surface transportation programs. The federal funding for transportation infrastructure is distributed by mode, with most of it automatically divided among states. This makes it challenging for projects involving multiple modes to secure significant funding. One project facing this issue is Amtrak's Gateway Program, specifically the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, aimed at increasing rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. The Gateway Program by Amtrak aims to increase rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. The existing tunnel, over a century old, was damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and is deteriorating. The Gateway Program by Amtrak aims to increase rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for the project is limited, with the largest rail grant program in FY2017 at $68 million, increasing to $593 million in FY2018 but with restrictions on use for the Hudson Tunnel project. The Capital Investment Grants program has more funding available at $2.6 billion in FY2018. In recent years, funding for intercity rail projects has been limited. The largest rail grant program in FY2017 was $68 million, increasing to $593 million in FY2018, with $285 million reserved for non-qualifying projects. The Capital Investment Grants program had $2.6 billion in FY2018, but competition for funding is intense. An agreement was previously reached for cost-sharing on the new Hudson Tunnel, but the Trump Administration may not honor it. Congress would need to provide the necessary funding. The Trump Administration may not honor the previous agreement to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel, leaving it up to Congress to provide funding. Despite the lack of mention in FY2019 THUD committee reports, both House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could benefit from. Additionally, there was a recommendation for $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than requested for FY2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could benefit from, as well as an additional $240 million for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized grants for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for preventive maintenance and capital projects, with the Administration requesting $120 million for FY2019. The Senate Appropriation Committee's FY2018 DOT appropriations bill provided the final installment of a $1.5 billion funding commitment made in 2008 for WMATA. The Administration requested $120 million for FY2019, with the House and Senate recommending $150 million. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the authorization for the grant and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA faces maintenance backlog due to inadequate investment. WMATA is urged to extend grant authorization and implement wireless service throughout the rail system. The agency faces a maintenance backlog and has experienced fatal incidents, leading to questions about its safety culture. Mismanagement of federal funding has led to restrictions on WMATA's use of funds, with FTA assuming oversight of safety compliance practices in 2015. FTA restricted WMATA's federal funding due to mismanagement. In 2015, FTA took over safety oversight from the Tri-State Oversight Committee, issuing recommendations for improvement. FTA conducts inspections, accident investigations, and ensures funds are used for safety. In 2017, FTA withheld 5% of funds until new safety oversight legislation was established. The FTA withheld 5% of WMATA's federal funding in 2017 until new safety oversight legislation was established. The Metrorail Safety Commission was created to replace the Tri-State Oversight Committee, but must be operational before funding is released. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, but Congress would need to act for this to happen. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that oversight of WMATA's rail operations be transferred from FTA to FRA, which has a stronger safety enforcement history. Congress would need to authorize FRA to oversee WMATA, as FTA already has that authority."
