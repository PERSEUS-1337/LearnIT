    "content": "\"Services\" encompass a wide range of economic activities involving human value-added like labor, advice, and entertainment. They are intangible, must be consumed at the point of production, but technology is reducing these restrictions. Examples include retail trade, transportation, information, banking, education, and professional services. The service sector in the U.S. economy is significant, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP in 2010. Various services like wholesale, retail, transportation, banking, insurance, and healthcare play a crucial role in the economy by facilitating capital flow. In 2010, the service sector in the U.S. accounted for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP. Financial services are crucial for capital flow, delivery services ensure goods availability, and distribution services make goods accessible to consumers. U.S. trade in services, though smaller than trade in goods, plays a significant role in overall trade. Distribution services ensure goods availability to consumers, with U.S. trade in services playing a smaller but significant role in overall trade. Services accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports in 2010, requiring a direct presence in the country of the consumer for many service providers. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, compared to $518 billion in U.S. cross-border exports. Foreign firms also sold services to U.S. residents. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold $727 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. This data provides a more accurate measurement of trade in services, although it is still incomplete. The total value of trade in services also includes modes of delivery involving the temporary movement of consumers and providers, for which U.S. data is not readily available. The Trade Act of 1974 instructed the Administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during the Tokyo Round negotiations. Developing countries were reluctant to have services covered by international agreements. During the Tokyo Round negotiations in 1979, industrialized countries, led by the United States, pushed for the inclusion of services in international trade rules. Developing countries were initially hesitant due to less advanced service sectors. Services were eventually included in the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, leading to the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identified three main challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services. The Marrakesh Agreement established the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and other Uruguay Round Agreements. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty outlined challenges in creating rules for international trade in services, including targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and considering services transactions behind customs borders. Technology advances, like the internet, have made once non-tradable services tradable. The challenges in creating rules for international trade in services include addressing domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and considering services transactions behind customs borders. Technology advances, such as the internet, have made once non-tradable services tradable and led to the rapid introduction of services products that can be \"outsourced\" across borders. Effective trade rules need to be flexible yet provide meaningful discipline to WTO members' activities, taking into account the various modes of delivery. The GATS structure recognizes that most services transactions occur within borders, with barriers inside customs barriers. Effective trade rules must consider different modes of service delivery to identify barriers for foreign providers. The GATS categorizes delivery modes into four categories, with concessions in opening services markets being mode-dependent. The four modes are: Cross-border supply (mode 1) - service supplied from one country to another, with supplier and consumer in their respective countries. The GATS structure recognizes that services transactions occur within borders, with barriers inside customs barriers. Effective trade rules must consider different modes of service delivery. Concessions in opening services markets are mode-dependent. The four modes are: Cross-border supply (mode 1) - service supplied from one country to another, with supplier and consumer in their respective countries. The other modes include consumption abroad (mode 2) and commercial presence (mode 3). The GATS recognizes services transactions occur within borders with barriers inside customs barriers. Effective trade rules must consider different modes of service delivery. The four modes are: Cross-border supply (mode 1), consumption abroad (mode 2), commercial presence (mode 3), and presence of natural persons (mode 4). The GATS is an agreement among 153 WTO members providing a framework for government policies affecting trade in services. The GATS is a multilateral agreement among 153 WTO members that sets out principles and rules for government policies affecting trade in services. It aims to promote economic development through trade expansion and progressive liberalization while preserving governments' right to regulate services sectors. The GATS is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services except those provided by government authority. It also addresses barriers to trade at all levels of government and aims to facilitate the participation of developing countries, including least developed countries.

Part I defines the scope of the GATS, including its application to all services except those provided by government authority, addressing barriers to trade at all levels of government, and facilitating the participation of developing countries, including least developed countries. Part II presents principles and obligations that apply to all services sectors, including unconditional most-favored-nation non-discriminatory treatment and transparency requirements. Part II of the GATS outlines key principles and obligations for all service sectors, including most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, impartial administration of regulations, and requirements for monopoly suppliers. It also includes exceptions for balance of payments difficulties and national security purposes. Part II of the GATS establishes principles and obligations for service sectors, including most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, and requirements for monopoly suppliers. It also allows for exceptions in cases of balance of payments difficulties and national security concerns. Part III of the GATS sets market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding them to their commitments once made. Members are prohibited from imposing less favorable treatment than committed to and placing limits on foreign service suppliers in various aspects. Part III of the GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for member countries, ensuring that service suppliers from other member countries are not treated less favorably than domestic providers. This allows for negotiations to further reduce barriers to trade in services. Unlike other principles in Part II, national treatment and market access obligations are restricted to specific services and modes of supply. Part III of the GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for member countries, ensuring equal treatment for service providers. These obligations are limited to specific services and modes of delivery listed in each member's schedule of commitments. The positive list approach is used, meaning obligations do not apply to services sectors outside the schedule. Each member's commitments are detailed in an annex to the GATS. Parts IV-VI are technical but essential elements of the agreement. Parts IV-VI of the GATS require new negotiations to expand coverage, handle conflicts in dispute settlement, and have annexes on various services such as financial, transportation, telecommunication, and maritime services. The GATS includes annexes on various services like financial, transportation, telecommunication, and maritime services. Negotiations on these services were ongoing to be included in the GATS when they entered into force. The GATS stipulated negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications and financial services in 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in 1995 with few results, while maritime services negotiations ended in 1996. WTO members' commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a significant part of their obligations under the GATS and the Doha Development Agenda round. The commitments made by WTO members on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a major part of their obligations under the GATS and the Doha Development Agenda round. Each member is required to submit a schedule of commitments (SC) during negotiations, which is a complex document divided into four columns detailing sector/subsector restrictions. The GATS requires WTO members to submit a schedule of commitments (SC) detailing restrictions on market access and national treatment for service sectors. The SC is divided into four columns listing sector/subsector commitments and additional commitments made by the member. It is also divided into horizontal commitments applying to all sectors and sector-specific commitments. The schedule of commitments in the GATS requires WTO members to detail restrictions on market access and national treatment for service sectors. The SC is divided into two parts: horizontal commitments applying to all sectors and sector-specific commitments. The negotiations aim to reform GATS rules and expand commitments to increase service sectors. The negotiations on services in the DDA aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and increase service sectors covered. This includes refining and expanding schedule of commitments to reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. The evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations are examined, along with U.S. goals and those of other major trading partners. The GATS required WTO members to start new negotiations on services within five years of its entry into force. These negotiations address issues like government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and special treatment for least developed countries. The GATS mandates negotiations on government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and special treatment for least developed countries in trade in services. The negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to political issues. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the negotiations, focusing on progressive liberalization. The WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines in March 2001 for negotiations on progressive liberalization of trade in services. The guidelines cover all service sectors and modes of delivery, with negotiations conducted in special sessions open to all WTO members. Negotiations on safeguards measures for subsectors and all modes of delivery were to be completed by the end of the DDA. The negotiations are conducted in special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services, open to all WTO members and acceding countries. The starting point is the scheduled commitments, using the \"request-offer\" format for new commitments. Special attention is given to the special needs of developing countries. Modalities were adopted on September 3, 2003, including negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization. The WTO members adopted modalities on September 3, 2003, to negotiate trade liberalization, including negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization. The DDA was successfully launched in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle, with the Ministerial Declaration folding services negotiation into the agenda. Initial requests for market access and national treatment commitments were to be submitted by participants. The DDA was launched in November 2001 with the Ministerial Declaration folding services negotiation into the agenda. Deadlines were set for initial requests and offers, but the services negotiations floundered. WTO members forged a negotiating framework in July 2004 to put the round back on track. The WTO was on the verge of collapse in September 2003 after member countries failed to agree on agriculture and non-agricultural market access modalities. A negotiating framework was established in July 2004 to get the round back on track, emphasizing the importance of timely and high-quality offers. Services were briefly mentioned in the framework, which was significant for U.S. business. The DDA negotiators emphasized the need for high-quality offers after complaints from WTO officials about missed deadlines and poor offer quality. Services were mentioned in the July framework, putting them on par with agriculture and non-agricultural goods negotiations. Negotiations on rules are conducted by working groups, with national treatment and market access addressed through the request-offer format. Members submit wish-lists and requests for commitments from each other to continue negotiations. The negotiations on national treatment and market access commitments in the WTO involve working groups of representatives submitting wish-lists and requests for commitments in a request-offer format. This process includes bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral negotiations among members until consensus is reached on acceptable commitment offers. The WTO services negotiations involve bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral negotiations among members to reach consensus on commitment offers. The negotiations have been ongoing for over five years, with delays and disappointing results similar to those in agriculture and non-agriculture market access. In 2006, the DDA negotiations were suspended by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy due to disagreements on fundamental modalities in agriculture trade, but resumed in 2007. The WTO services negotiations have faced delays and disappointing results, similar to agriculture and non-agriculture market access talks. In 2006, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA negotiations due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities, which resumed in 2007. The United States and chief trading partners have not reached a consensus on negotiating objectives. The United States and its chief trading partners have differing objectives in the WTO services negotiations. The US aims to secure market access commitments, particularly in the service industry, while also seeking more liberal market access and national treatment commitments than those made in the Uruguay Round. The US aims to secure market access commitments in the service industry and calls for countries to raise binding levels to prevent slippage. Government regulation is a significant aspect of services trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. Government regulation is a key aspect of services trade, more prevalent than in manufactured goods trade. GATS rules acknowledge the necessity of regulation to protect consumers, such as ensuring the qualifications of professionals like lawyers and doctors. Services sectors are regulated by various government agencies at different levels, both domestically and internationally. Service providers, whether local or foreign, must understand and comply with these regulations. US service providers have raised concerns about the lack of transparency in regulatory processes. The United States wants WTO member countries to establish clear, transparent domestic procedures for regulations in order to increase foreign trade in services, especially in developing countries. The United States is urging WTO member countries to establish transparent domestic procedures for regulations to boost foreign trade in services, including eliminating unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors. The United States is pushing WTO members to eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, including in financial services like insurance, banking, and securities. They are also seeking commitments to improve market access, transparency, and fairness in applying regulations. Additionally, the US proposed initiatives to expedite new market entry in insurance and increase market access in telecommunications services. The United States is requesting WTO members to increase market access in telecommunications services, expedite new-to-market initiatives in insurance, and address issues of cross-subsidization in express delivery services. They are also seeking commitments for owning and leasing cable facilities, road freight transport, order processing services, and inventory management services. The United States is requesting increased market access in various services, including road freight transport, order processing, inventory management, and energy services. They are also addressing cross-subsidization issues in express delivery services and seeking commitments for third-party access to energy transportation facilities. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services, including energy services, environmental protection services, and retail, wholesale, and franchising services. They are also seeking commitments for third-party access to energy transportation facilities. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services, including environmental protection services, retail, wholesale, and franchising services. They are also seeking commitments for third-party access to energy transportation facilities. Additionally, the US is asking trading partners to increase market access for foreign lawyers, accountants, and other professional service providers by removing citizenship requirements. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services, including job-related courses, computer services, audiovisual, and advertising services. They are asking trading partners to remove citizenship requirements for licensing and other restrictions to increase market access for foreign professionals. The United States has requested increased market access for computer and related services, audiovisual, and advertising services. Initial and revised offers were submitted in 2003 and 2005, committing to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The United States has requested increased market access for various services and has committed to maintaining national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The U.S. defends its offers by stating that its services markets are already open and competitive, expecting WTO members to meet its standards. The United States offers horizontal commitments in various sectors, including temporary entry of personnel, with specific limitations for certain groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S. No commitments are made for personnel selling to the U.S. public or staying longer than 90 days. The United States allows temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S., including sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, personnel establishing a business entity, fashion models, and service providers in specialty occupations. Personnel engaged in land acquisition in scheduled services sectors are also permitted entry. Initial acquisition of federally owned land is restricted to U.S. citizens. The United States allows temporary entry for fashion models and service providers in specialty occupations. Foreigners engaged in providing scheduled services are taxed the same as U.S. residents. The U.S. has offered commitments in business services, including professional services, accounting, taxation, and architectural and engineering services. Members must identify exceptions for national treatment and market access for each sector and subsector. The United States has offered commitments in various business services sectors and subsectors, including professional services, accounting, taxation, architectural and engineering services. Exceptions mainly relate to state restrictions on foreign service providers. Other services the U.S. has offered commitments in include market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, delivery services, and telecommunication services. The United States has offered commitments in various business services sectors including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, delivery services, telecommunication services, wholesale and retail trade services, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, recreational and cultural services, transportation services, energy services, and construction services. Developing countries have criticized the U.S. for not offering broader commitments in these sectors. The United States has offered commitments in various business services sectors, but developing countries criticize the lack of broader commitments. The European Union also criticizes the U.S. for not opening maritime and postal services to foreign competition. India argues for access for software specialists. India argues for access for software specialists, computer experts, and information technology engineers under the mode-4 category of delivery, which has been a contentious issue in the DDA negotiations. Deadlines for procedural steps have been rescheduled due to the complexity of the negotiations. The negotiations for the DDA have faced delays in meeting deadlines for procedural steps, with the complexity of the process being a major factor. Some suggest that the \"request-offer\" format may be hindering progress. The US and EU proposed establishing \"benchmarks\" in core sectors like financial services and telecommunications, while the EU preferred a smaller list for commitments. Negotiators proposed \"benchmarks\" for targeted sectors in WTO negotiations, with the US advocating for commitments in six core sectors and the EU preferring a smaller list. Developing countries opposed the idea, arguing it deviated from the established \"request-offer\" format mandated for the DDA negotiations. Some developing countries and the U.S. services business community expressed concerns about using benchmarks in WTO negotiations, fearing they would favor developed countries and cause delays. Canada, supported by the U.S. and other developed countries, proposed changes to the negotiating process to jumpstart talks on services. Canada, supported by the United States and other developed countries, proposed changes in the negotiating process to accelerate talks on services. The United States pushed for clearer identification of concessions before completing agriculture and non-agricultural negotiations. Developing countries rejected the proposal and prefer to maintain the current sequencing. The positive list approach for market access commitments has also faced criticism for potentially discouraging market participation. The positive list approach for market access commitments has been criticized for potentially discouraging market participation, as it may not cover new sectors that emerge. Developing countries prefer to maintain the current sequencing in negotiations, while the United States advocates for the \"negative list\" approach. The \"negative list\" approach is favored by the United States in free trade agreements, particularly for mode-4 delivery in services. This issue has caused division between developed and developing countries, with criticism directed at the U.S. despite mode-4 accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services. Despite mode-4 accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services, there has been criticism of the United States regarding this delivery mode. The controversy is linked to immigration policies and tensions between the U.S. business community and government, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Mode-4, as defined in Article I-1(d) of the GATS, involves the supply of services by a service supplier through the presence of natural persons in another WTO Member's territory. Mode-4 in the GATS pertains to service supply through natural persons in another WTO Member's territory. Developing countries criticize the US for limited mode-4 commitments, especially visa restrictions on temporary workers. India calls for transparency in US immigration regulations for temporary personnel entry. Congressional authority is also a concern regarding mode-4. The mode-4 issue in the GATS pertains to service supply through natural persons in another WTO Member's territory. Concerns have been raised about visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the United States, with calls for greater transparency in U.S. immigration regulations. Congressional authority has also been a point of contention, with objections raised during the consideration of implementing bills for free trade agreements. Compromises were made to allow the bills to be voted on, but bipartisan warnings were issued regarding changes in visa policy. The U.S. business community advocates for flexibility in visa policies to boost negotiations and secure commitments from developing countries. However, little progress has been made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures for services. Developing countries, particularly in East Asia, are closely monitoring these developments. Negotiations on rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures in services have not advanced much. Developing countries, especially in East Asia, prioritize these issues but face unresolved questions on countervailable subsidies and safeguard measures. Government procurement talks have also been slow, with little progress in services negotiations after over 10 years. Negotiations on government procurement and services in the WTO have been slow, with little progress made in over 10 years. A World Bank assessment found that many WTO members, especially developing countries, have not significantly changed their commitments from the Uruguay Round, resulting in services offers that are 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies. WTO members are hesitant to bind their trade in services and prefer the option to impose more restrictions without violating commitments. The suspension of the DDA by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy has further hindered negotiation prospects. The WTO services negotiations have been slow, with little progress made in over 10 years. WTO members are reluctant to lock in their trade in services, preferring the option to impose more restrictions without violating commitments. The suspension of the DDA by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy has further hindered negotiation prospects. Progress in the WTO services negotiations has been slow for over a decade due to the division between developed and developing countries. The lack of advancement in agriculture and NAMA negotiations has also impeded progress in services negotiations. Developing countries are hesitant to improve their offers until the US and EU make commitments. The slow progress in WTO services negotiations is hindered by the division between developed and developing countries. Developing countries are reluctant to improve offers until the US and EU commit to reducing agriculture subsidies. The complexity of the services agenda and differing trade barriers across sectors also contribute to the challenges. The slow progress in WTO services negotiations is hindered by the complexity of the agenda and the number of players involved. Services negotiations involve various economic activities with different trade barriers, making it challenging to formulate trade rules. Additionally, negotiations include representatives from regulatory agencies who may not prioritize trade liberalization. The prospects for the negotiations are uncertain, as participants often wait until crucial deadlines to reveal their best negotiating positions. The WTO services negotiations face challenges due to the complexity of the agenda and the number of players involved. Political will, willingness to compromise, and resolution of issues in agriculture and non-agriculture market access will determine the completion of the negotiations. WTO trade ministers met in Hong Kong in December 2005 for the sixth WTO Ministerial. During the sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005, trade ministers aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations by resolving issues in agriculture and non-agriculture market access. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration reaffirmed commitment to completing services negotiations, with a focus on the needs of developing countries. In September 2007, the chairman initiated the development of a draft agreement for member-country negotiators to submit. In September 2007, the chairman of the trade in services negotiations began developing a draft text of an agreement, calling on member-country negotiators to submit contributions. By the end of 2007, countries were still divided on objectives, with developed countries pushing for binding commitments on trade in services while developing countries resisted without greater reductions in agriculture subsidies. WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in July 2008 to address the impasse. In July 2008, WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva to address the impasse on trade in services and agriculture negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held with 32 representatives to gauge offers and expectations, but little progress was made. In 2009, cluster meetings were held with limited results. The WTO conference in 2008 aimed to assess participants' offers and expectations but made little progress. Subsequent cluster meetings in 2009 had limited results, with services negotiations stalled due to reluctance to increase liberalization levels. Senator Grassley expressed concern over the stagnant Doha services negotiations."
