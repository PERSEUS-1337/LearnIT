    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that there are over 600 different Federal financial assistance programs, some of which have duplicative or burdensome administrative requirements, hindering cost-effective service delivery. Streamlining these procedures will improve services to the public. The purposes of this Act are to improve the effectiveness and performance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify application and reporting requirements, enhance service delivery to the public, and promote greater coordination among service providers. In this Act, key definitions include Director (Director of the Office of Management and Budget), Federal agency (defined under section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code), Federal financial assistance (defined in section 7501(a)(5) of title 31, United States Code), local government (political subdivision of a State), and non-Federal entity (State, local government, or nonprofit organization). Local government is a political subdivision of a State, while a non-Federal entity refers to a State, local government, or nonprofit organization. A nonprofit organization is operated for public interest purposes, not for profit, and uses proceeds to maintain its operations. A nonprofit organization is operated primarily for scientific, educational, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest, not for profit, and uses net proceeds to maintain, improve, or expand its operations.
