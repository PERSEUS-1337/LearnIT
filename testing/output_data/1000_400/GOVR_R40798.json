It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force. The rate can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. The unemployment rate can fluctuate based on changes in the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, but it may increase if people see signs of economic improvement. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator, improving slowly even when the economy shows positive signs. During a recession, the unemployment rate may rise as discouraged workers reenter the labor force. It is a lagging economic indicator that improves slowly even after positive economic signs. Firms are hesitant to hire new workers until they are certain of sustained economic growth. The economy will continue growing, leading to an increase in GDP. Employers may boost production by restoring hours and having employees work overtime instead of hiring new workers. Job growth may not happen immediately. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for job data from nonfarm employers, which is considered more accurate than the Current Population Survey for unemployment rate and demographic information. The Business Cycle Dating Committee relies on changes in national output and employment trends from the establishment survey to determine recessions. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates consistently increased until after each recession ended. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates consistently increased until after each recession ended, peaking at different points in the business cycle. After 10 recessions since World War II, the unemployment rate consistently rose until after each recession ended, peaking at different points in the business cycle. Job growth did not occur steadily until some months after the end of all recessions. After 10 recessions since World War II, the unemployment rate consistently rose until after each recession ended. Job growth did not occur steadily until some months after the end of all recessions, with sustained job growth failing to ensue until after the end of all 10 recessions. In most cases, the number of jobs on employer payrolls fluctuated for months after the recession's end, with sustained job growth occurring within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries. However, in the cases of the July 1990-March 1991 recession and the March-November 2001 recession, steady job growth did not commence until 12 and 22 months after the recession ended, respectively. The delayed improvement in the labor market following the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to jobless recoveries. While private sector employment started to rise in January 2010, fiscal problems in local governments have slowed overall job growth."
