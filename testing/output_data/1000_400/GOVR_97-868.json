    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" connecting millions of computers worldwide through unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access, with TLDs like .com or country codes like .jp. The DNS is a global database mapping addresses to domain names. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed set of databases containing address numbers mapped to domain names. Root servers coordinate connectivity across the Internet. The Internet originated from military research funding and evolved with civilian support. Key entities played roles in managing the DNS. The Internet and the DNS were initially established by DARPA for military use, but a civilian segment emerged with support from the NSF. Key entities like IANA and NSF played crucial roles in managing the DNS, making technical decisions and assigning IP addresses. The NSF managed root servers, qualifications for TLD managers, protocol parameters, and IP address space. In 1993, NSF signed an agreement with InterNic for domain name registration, leading to NSI's sole control over .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Criticism grew over NSI's control and trademark disputes increased after registration fees were imposed in 1995. NSI became the sole domain name registration service for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs, facing criticism for its control and trademark disputes. Concerns about IANA's legal foundation led to the proposal of creating seven new gTLDs and introducing more registrars for competition. An International Ad Hoc Committee proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing more registrars for competition. The U.S. government formed an interagency group to address the domain name issue and issued a final statement of policy in June 1998. The U.S. government formed an interagency group led by the NTIA to address the domain name issue. In June 1998, the DOC issued a final policy statement endorsing the creation of a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses. The White Paper emphasized the importance of stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation in the management of Internet resources. The U.S. government assessed the new system for managing Internet names and addresses to ensure stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation. Internet constituencies worldwide discussed the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), with final bylaws and articles of incorporation submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. After multiple iterations, ICANN's final bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN on November 25, 1998, outlining the transition of DNS management responsibilities to a private-sector entity. The MOU was extended until September 30, 2006, with specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. On September 17, 2003, ICANN and the Department of Commerce agreed to extend their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) until September 30, 2006. The MOU specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. On June 30, 2005, the U.S. government stated its principles on the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing the importance of preserving security and stability. Additionally, the U.S. government authorized changes to the root zone and recognized ICANN as the appropriate technical manager of the DNS. On September 29, 2006, a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) was announced by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce and ICANN agreed to extend their Memorandum of Understanding until September 30, 2006, focusing on transition tasks for ICANN. The U.S. government emphasized the importance of security and stability in the domain name system, authorizing changes to the root zone and recognizing ICANN as the technical manager of the DNS. A new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) was announced on September 29, 2006, to continue the transition to the private sector for managing DNS functions. In 2009, the Department of Commerce and ICANN agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments to institutionalize transparency and accountability in the DNS coordination. ICANN, a nonprofit corporation based in California, is committed to ensuring accountability, transparency, security, stability, and promoting competition and international participation. ICANN is a benefit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law. It has tax-exempt status and a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations. The Board makes final policy decisions with 16 international members. The Board of Directors of ICANN, consisting of 16 international members, is advised by subgroups who develop policies and conduct research. The Board makes final decisions on policy and operations, with members selected from various organizations. The growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to a significant increase in the ICANN budget and staff since 2000. The explosive growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to a significant increase in the ICANN budget and staff. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Registry operators like VeriSign, Inc., Public Interest Registry, and Neustar, Inc. manage the master database of domain names in different top-level domains. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. The Department of Commerce has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees, along with other committees, are interested in issues related to ICANN such as intellectual property and privacy. The Department of Commerce has historical ties to the development of the Internet but no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a process to transition DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce initiated the transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government retains a role in DNS through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN was signed on September 30, 2009 to institutionalize the technical coordination of the DNS globally. It succeeded the Joint Project Agreement and has no expiration date, concluding only if one party decides to terminate the agreement. Various Internet stakeholders disagreed on whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN, signed in 2009, has no expiration date and would conclude only if one party decides to terminate the agreement. Stakeholders debated whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN, with U.S. groups advocating for continued oversight due to concerns about transparency and accountability, while international entities argued that ICANN had met necessary standards. Many stakeholders debated the need for continued DOC oversight of ICANN to prevent undue control by foreign governments, while international groups argued that ICANN had met conditions for privatization. In the 110th Congress, Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 expressing the need for more progress in achieving accountability and transparency. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry on the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, noting some progress but the need for further improvement. The Senate expressed the need for more progress in ICANN's accountability and transparency. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the JPA expiration, highlighting areas for improvement in ICANN's institutional confidence. Key areas included long-term stability, accountability, responsiveness, private-sector leadership, stakeholder participation, contract compliance, and competition. Public comments were requested on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and ICANN's model of leadership and policy development. The NTIA sought public comments on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and ICANN's leadership model. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed extending the JPA or a similar agreement between DOC and ICANN. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed extending the JPA or a similar agreement between DOC and ICANN, urging for a \"permanent instrument\" to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and global stakeholders. This instrument should maintain the DOC-ICANN relationship, provide for periodic reviews of ICANN performance, outline steps for accountability improvement, and facilitate the addition of new gTLDs and internationalized domain names. The committee letter outlines key requirements for the permanent instrument between DOC and ICANN, including periodic reviews of ICANN performance, accountability measures, addition of new gTLDs, WHOIS information access, and ICANN remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States. The AoC emphasizes ICANN's status as a private organization with global offices and the establishment of review panels for oversight. ICANN commits to remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) emphasizes ICANN's private status and calls for the establishment of review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. The panels will evaluate ICANN governance and assess transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to the public and global Internet community. The panel, composed of key stakeholders including the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee, will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. The composition of the panel will be jointly agreed upon to ensure transparency and accountability. The panel will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. It will include the chair of the GAC, the CEO of ICANN, representatives of relevant Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations, and independent experts. The impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and choice will be periodically examined. The panel will also review existing WHOIS policy. The panel, consisting of key stakeholders and experts, will review the existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting law enforcement needs and promoting consumer trust. The composition of the panel will be jointly agreed upon by the chair of the GAC and the CEO of ICANN. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability, which were adopted by the Board in June 2011. The focus now shifts to ICANN management and staff to implement these recommendations promptly for meaningful reform. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011. A follow-up report, ATRT2, presented 12 new recommendations to ICANN. The \"IANA functions contract\" allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions related to the DNS. The \"IANA functions contract\" authorizes ICANN to manage critical technical functions of the DNS, including allocating IP addresses and editing the root zone file. A cooperative agreement between DOC and VeriSign allows VeriSign to maintain the official root zone file on the Internet's root servers. The U.S. government has authority over the root zone file, enabling approval or denial of changes, such as adding new top-level domains. The U.S. government has authority over the root zone file, allowing approval or denial of changes like adding new top-level domains. The June 30, 2005, U.S. government principles aim to preserve the security and stability of the DNS. The expiration of the JPA and the establishment of the AoC did not directly affect U.S. government authority over the DNS root zone file. The JPA was separate from DOC agreements with ICANN and VeriSign. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not affect U.S. government authority over the DNS root zone file. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with an option to extend through September 2019. The contract includes a separation between policy development and implementation, as well as a conflict of interest policy and respect for local national law. The IANA functions contract with ICANN through September 30, 2015 includes a separation between policy development and implementation, a conflict of interest policy, and respect for local national law. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with primary operations and systems in the United States, and subject to inspection by the U.S. government. The NTIA has authority over ICANN and the domain name system through the IANA functions contract and cooperative agreement with Verisign. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role to the global Internet community, potentially letting the IANA functions contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA is asking ICANN to convene stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. NTIA is asking ICANN to convene global Internet stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition of key domain name functions. NTIA expects ICANN to collaborate with parties affected by the IANA contract, including technical organizations and top-level domain operators. In October 2013, Internet technical organizations and global stakeholders called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA requires a transition proposal with broad community support, maintaining the multistakeholder model and the security of the Internet DNS. The NTIA requires a transition proposal with broad community support, maintaining the multistakeholder model and the security of the Internet DNS. Supporters argue that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model and prevent intergovernmental control over the Internet. Supporters of the transition argue that the U.S. government's support for the multistakeholder model of Internet governance will help prevent intergovernmental control over the Internet. They believe that ICANN has matured and improved its accountability, making the transition possible. Critics, however, are concerned that the NTIA's oversight has been a necessary safeguard for the integrity and stability of the DNS. Critics are concerned about the potential risks of transitioning NTIA's authority over ICANN and the DNS, fearing increased intergovernmental control and the development of a new international multistakeholder entity. Critics fear that relinquishing NTIA's authority over ICANN and the DNS could lead to foreign governments gaining influence over Internet censorship. H.R. 4342 aims to delay this transition until a report on NTIA's role is submitted to Congress. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prevent the NTIA from giving up control of the Internet domain name system until a report on the implications is submitted to Congress. The bill addresses national security concerns and requires a definition of the \"multistakeholder model\" used by NTIA. H.R. 4342 was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014.

The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act emphasized maintaining separation between policymaking and technical operations in Internet governance. Section 1646 of S. 2410 focused on ensuring the exclusive use of '.MIL' domain and Internet Protocol address numbers by the Department of Defense for national security. The Department of Defense was directed to sustain the stewardship of Internet root zone servers and seek an agreement for the .mil domain to maintain its status after the transition. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, signed on December 16, 2014, affirms the .mil domain's status as a generic top-level domain. Congress emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy domain names and IP address numbers during the IANA transition. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy domain names and IP address numbers, particularly those used for national security purposes, during the IANA transition. Congress also highlights the importance of upholding consensus-based decision making and ensuring the accountability process of the multi-stakeholder model works transparently, securely, and efficiently to maintain a free, open, and resilient Internet. The accountability process of the multi-stakeholder model is emphasized to work transparently, securely, and efficiently to maintain a free, open, and resilient Internet. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act, does not include funds for the transition to be fully considered by Congress. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act, which does not include funds for the transition of Internet domain name system functions. An amendment was adopted to prevent the relinquishment of responsibility by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. On May 30, 2014, H.R. 4660 was passed by the House (229-178), stating that funds cannot be used to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review any proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. The committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. NTIA is required to report quarterly on the privatization process and inform the committee in advance of any decision on a successor contract.

NTIA must report quarterly on the privatization process and inform the committee in advance of any decision on a successor contract. The committee expressed concern about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions until September 30, 2015. During FY2015, NTIA is prohibited from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions, including the authoritative root zone file and IANA functions. The prohibition expires on September 30, 2015. NTIA must inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA is also required to submit a report to House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of the enactment of P.L. 113-235 regarding available recourse options. The Explanatory Statement directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA must also submit a report to House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of the enactment of P.L. 113-235 regarding available recourse options. The proposed transition included bills such as H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, which aimed to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its DNS and domain name responsibilities without meeting specified criteria. These bills were referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, while a hearing was held by the House Judiciary Committee on April 10, 2014. The DOTCOM Act of 2015 reintroduced by Representative Shimkus as H.R. 805 prohibits NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress examining the implications of the proposed transfer. H.R. 805 prohibits NTIA from transferring responsibility of the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress. The report will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the transfer, principles set for the transfer, transfer proposals received, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and concerns regarding the security of the Internet domain name system. GAO will also define the term \"multistakeholder model\" as used by NTIA in Internet policymaking and governance. The GAO is directed to analyze concerns raised by the relinquishment of Internet domain name system responsibility, including security implications. H.R. 805 and S.Res. 71 aim to increase public awareness and understanding of NTIA's proposed transition. S.Res. 71, introduced by Senator Hatch on February 5, 2015, aims to raise public awareness about NTIA's proposed transition of Internet governance responsibilities to ICANN. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 on February 5, 2015, and a hearing was held on February 25, 2015, to discuss preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. ICANN is working on a process for the community to reach a consensus on the transition. On February 25, 2015, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on \"Preserving the Multistakeholder Model of Internet Governance.\" ICANN is leading a process for the community to develop a transition proposal for the IANA functions. A steering group would oversee the process in an open and accountable manner. ICANN presented a draft proposal for the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions at a meeting in March 2014. A steering group was suggested to oversee the process in an open, transparent, inclusive, and accountable manner. After receiving public comments, ICANN formed the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) comprised of 30 individuals representing 13 communities. On June 6, 2014, ICANN announced the formation of the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) to prepare a transition proposal. The ICG consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, tasked with coordinating the development of a proposal for the IANA functions. The group requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by the operational communities associated with each function. The ICG requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by operational communities. The proposals for Domain Names and Number Resources are in progress, with a target submission date of June 2015. The Protocol Parameters proposal has been submitted to the ICG by the IANAPLAN Working Group. The final proposal submission deadline for the ICG is June 2015. The five RIRs submitted the numbering proposal on January 15, 2015, and the IETF submitted the protocol parameter proposal on January 6, 2015. The domain name function proposal deadline has been extended to June 2015 due to difficulties in reaching a consensus. Consensus on a domain name function proposal has proven difficult to reach, with the CWG-Stewardship group unable to meet the extended deadline of June 2015. The debate revolves around whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability in parallel with the IANA stewardship transition. This process aims to strengthen ICANN's accountability mechanisms in the absence of its historical contractual relationship with the U.S. government. ICANN is working on enhancing its accountability mechanisms in preparation for the potential end of its contract with the U.S. government. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed to develop proposals for strengthening accountability, with decisions made by consensus. The group is open to all interested participants. The CCWG-Accountability, consisting of 25 members and 141 participants, aims to enhance ICANN's accountability. Decisions will be made by consensus, with the group open to any interested person as a participant. Seven advisors will provide independent advice, while other members include ICANN staff, past participants, liaisons, and board members. The CCWG-Accountability, with 25 members and 141 participants, is working on enhancing ICANN's accountability. They are pursuing two interrelated Work Streams focusing on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe. If approved, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. The CCWG-Accountability is working on enhancing ICANN's accountability through two Work Streams. Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics extending beyond the IANA transition. The accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval, with NTIA needing to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to occur. The Workstream 1 proposal is set to be submitted to the ICANN Board in June 2015, while Workstream 2's proposal will follow after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA must approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to proceed. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling confirmed at the 2015 State of the Net Conference that appropriated funds will not be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. At the 2015 State of the Net Conference, NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling confirmed that appropriated funds will not be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. NTIA will actively monitor discussions within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan and participate in meetings with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders. Congress expects regular reporting on the transition process. NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan. They will participate in meetings with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders, providing informal feedback where appropriate. NTIA supports an open and participatory multistakeholder process and emphasizes the importance of getting the transition right on the first attempt. Administrator Strickling emphasized the importance of an open and participatory multistakeholder process for the transition of the IANA functions. He called for equal consideration of all transition proposal models and the creation of accountable organizational structures. NTIA stressed the need for a well-thought-out plan that addresses all concerns and supports the accountability process. NTIA emphasized the need for an accountable organizational structure to replace its oversight of the IANA functions contract. They called for stress testing of proposed solutions to safeguard against future contingencies and encouraged addressing issues such as board member removal and improving current accountability tools. Both transition processes (IANA function stewardship and accountability) should be carefully considered. NTIA emphasized the need for an accountable organizational structure to replace its oversight of the IANA functions contract. They called for stress testing of proposed solutions to safeguard against future contingencies and encouraged addressing issues such as board member removal and improving current accountability tools. NTIA stated that both transition processes (IANA function stewardship and accountability) should remain in sync, with a coordinated and complete transition plan to be delivered in the summer. The flexibility to extend the contract with ICANN beyond September 2015 is available if needed for the community to develop the best plan possible. ICANN, an international organization, has a flexible contract with the ability to extend beyond September 2015. The Board of Directors and constituency groups are global, and the Governmental Advisory Committee provides advice on public policy matters. The ICANN Board considers but is not obligated to follow GAC recommendations. ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) advises the ICANN Board on public policy matters. The U.S. government's authority over ICANN and the DNS has been questioned by foreign governments, suggesting international oversight. The United Nations studied greater international involvement in Internet governance at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. The United Nations, at the December 2003 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), debated and agreed to study the issue of achieving greater international involvement in the governance of the Internet and the domain name system. The U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) released a report in July 2005, proposing the internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. The report suggested various models, including ones where ICANN would be made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. The WGIG report called for further internationalization of Internet governance and proposed the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. Four possible models were suggested, including ones where ICANN would be made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. The report's conclusions were to be discussed during the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005. U.S. officials and the 109th Congress opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. The EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted towards an approach favoring enhanced international cooperation. The 109th Congress and the European Union initially supported U.S. control over ICANN. However, the EU later shifted towards favoring enhanced international governance of the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an agreement in November 2005, maintaining ICANN and U.S. roles in the domain name system. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss and debate. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss and debate Internet policy issues. It does not have binding authority and was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in 2010 for another five years. A Working Group on Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum was formed to develop recommendations for its enhancement. The Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) formed a Working Group on Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum, involving 22 governments and Internet stakeholder groups. Controversies over new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD led to debates on increased government influence on ICANN policy. Some nations, like the US, Canada, and the EU, support the current multistakeholder model but advocate for an enhanced role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Others, such as Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA), prefer a U.N.-based Internet policy entity. Some nations, including Russia and China, proposed a voluntary \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly, promoting a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet. The group of nations, including Russia and China, proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion at the U.N. General Assembly. The revised code emphasizes equal responsibility for all states in the international governance of the Internet, promoting transparency and democracy in Internet governance mechanisms. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) to address Internet governance mechanisms. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai aimed to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) to address Internet governance. The focus was on updating the 24-year-old ITRs to include Internet traffic and governance, with concerns raised in Congress about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet. The WCIT aimed to revise the ITRs to address Internet governance, raising concerns in Congress about potential intergovernmental control. The House Committee held a hearing on international proposals to regulate the Internet, with H.Con.Res. 127 expressing Congress's support for the multistakeholder governance model. H.Con.Res. 127, passed unanimously by the House, expressed Congress's support for a global Internet free from government control and the multistakeholder governance model. A similar resolution, S.Con.Res. 50, was introduced in the Senate. The House passed H.Con.Res. 127 unanimously, supporting a global Internet free from government control. In the Senate, S.Con.Res. 50 was introduced, emphasizing the importance of promoting a global Internet free from government control and preserving the multistakeholder model. S.Con.Res. 50 was passed by the Senate and the House unanimously in 2012, supporting a global Internet free from government control. A proposal during the WCIT sought to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance but was later withdrawn. The proposal at the WCIT sought to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance, including the right of Member States to manage Internet resources. It was withdrawn, but a nonbinding resolution was adopted promoting an equal role for governments in international Internet governance. The United States declined to sign the treaty at the WCIT in Dubai due to Resolution 3 and new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate over Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and overseeing U.S. efforts to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. Representative Walden introduced H.R. 1580, a bill affirming the U.S. policy on Internet governance. The 113th Congress will monitor the ongoing debate on Internet governance. H.R. 1580 affirms the U.S. policy to preserve the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The bill was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. In October 2013, ICANN's President and other Internet infrastructure leaders met in Uruguay to support this model. On May 14, 2013, H.R. 1580 was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives, affirming the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. In October 2013, ICANN's President and other Internet leaders met in Uruguay to strengthen global multistakeholder cooperation, emphasizing the importance of coherent Internet operations and addressing governance challenges. They expressed concern over trust issues due to surveillance revelations. The Montevideo Statement expressed strong concern over global trust issues due to surveillance revelations and called for ongoing efforts to address Internet Governance challenges. It emphasized the need for global multistakeholder cooperation and accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. Additionally, plans were announced for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014. The Montevideo Statement highlighted global trust issues post-surveillance revelations and emphasized multistakeholder cooperation. Plans for the NETmundial summit in April 2014 were announced, aiming to craft Internet governance principles and propose a roadmap for its evolution. The outcome was a nonbinding statement setting forth general principles and identifying future discussion topics. The outcome of NETmundial in April 2014 produced a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" outlining Internet governance principles and future discussion topics. The meeting reaffirmed the multistakeholder model, endorsed the transition of IANA functions to the global community, emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum, and highlighted the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN also announced the formation of a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation. The Internet Governance Forum's mandate was emphasized for strengthening and expanding, with a focus on human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, involving stakeholders from various sectors. The Panel's report, released in May 2014, outlined principles and frameworks for global Internet cooperation. Additionally, a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014. The report \"Towards a Collaborative, Decentralized Internet Governance Ecosystem\" was released in May 2014, proposing frameworks for cooperation and a roadmap for future Internet governance challenges. The NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The purpose of the initiative is to apply the NETmundial Principles to enable an effective and distributed approach to Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea, concluded in November 2014, setting general policies and adopting strategic plans every four years. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea, concluded on November 7, 2014, without expanding its role in Internet governance or cybersecurity issues. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses. The State Department viewed the ITU conference as successful, deciding not to expand its role in Internet governance or cybersecurity. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, with country codes like .us and generic TLDs like .com. ICANN established 22 gTLDs, some reserved for specific organizations and others open for registration. Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial or non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition. In 2004, ICANN held application rounds for new gTLDs, with 22 currently in operation. Some are reserved or restricted, while others are open for registration by anyone. Applicants are typically commercial or non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition to establish and operate name servers for their TLD registry. Debate focused on expanding the number of gTLDs, leading ICANN to develop rules for introducing an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system. ICANN embarked on a consultative process to expand the number of gTLDs, releasing iterations of the Applicant Guidebook. In 2011, the Board approved the launch of the new gTLD program, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced. Applications were accepted from January to April 2012 with a fee of $185,000. The approval of the program has been controversial. The Board of Directors approved the launch of the new gTLD program, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced. Applications were accepted from January to April 2012 with a fee of $185,000. The program has faced controversy over concerns about trademark protection, intellectual property rights, and combating cybercrimes across the new gTLDs. ICANN faced opposition from some parts of the U.S. government, including the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Judiciary Committee, and the Federal Trade Commission, over concerns about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes in the new gTLD expansion. Despite advocacy for additional protections by governments and the Governmental Advisory Committee, ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion in December 2011. ICANN faced opposition from some parts of the U.S. government towards the end of 2011, including Senate and House committees, and the Federal Trade Commission. Despite concerns, ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion, arguing it would offer more protections and competition. The application window for new gTLDs opened on January 12, 2012, with 1,930 applications received by June 13, 2012. ICANN did not delay the new gTLD program, opening the application window on January 12, 2012. By June 13, 2012, 1,930 applications were received, including geographic and Internationalized Domain Names. ICANN moved into the evaluation phase to decide on the acceptance of each application, a process that could take up to 9 months depending on various factors. ICANN is evaluating 1,930 new gTLD applications, a process that could take 9 to 20 months. Rules and procedures are outlined in ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, with 894 currently in the process. ICANN is evaluating 1,930 new gTLD applications, a process that could take 9 to 20 months. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, and 894 gTLDs are currently in the process. ICANN plans for a second round of applications with changes to the evaluation process. Concerns arise about potential domain name abuse with the introduction of new gTLDs. Many stakeholders are concerned about domain name abuse in new gTLDs. ICANN's approach to intellectual property protection and mitigating unlawful behavior will be closely watched. Legislation was enacted to create a \"kids-friendly\" top-level domain for age-appropriate content. Legislation was enacted in the 107th Congress to create a \"kids-friendly\" top-level domain name (kids.us) containing age-appropriate content. An adult content top-level domain name for material harmful to minors has also been considered in past Congresses. In past Congresses, bills were introduced to require ICANN to establish a mandatory top-level domain name for material harmful to minors. ICANN considered allowing a gTLD for adult content and entered negotiations for a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites. ICANN considered establishing a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, which sparked controversy. The Department of Commerce requested additional time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children before final approval. The Department of Commerce requested more time for ICANN to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children before final approval of the .xxx domain. Despite negotiations and a proposed revised agreement, the ICANN Board ultimately voted to deny the .xxx domain in March 2007. On May 10, 2006, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 against accepting the proposed agreement for the .xxx domain. In January 2007, a revised agreement was published for public comment. However, in March 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to manage Internet content. ICM Registry challenged this decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry in February 2010. The Independent Review Panel ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating that ICANN's rejection of ICM's application for a .xxx gTLD was not consistent with its policies. The ICANN Board voted to allow ICM's application at a meeting in Brussels in June 2010. At the ICANN meeting in Brussels in June 2010, the Board voted to allow ICM's .xxx TLD application to proceed. The Board approved next steps for the application, including due diligence, negotiations on a draft registry agreement, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. In December, the Board passed a resolution to enter into a registry agreement with ICM Registry for the .xxx TLD, pending formal consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. At the December ICANN meeting in Cartegena, Colombia, the Board passed a resolution to enter into a registry agreement with ICM Registry for the .xxx TLD, pending formal consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Despite conflicts with GAC advice, the Board approved the resolution in March 2011 at the ICANN meeting in San Francisco. The ICANN Board approved the resolution to establish the .xxx TLD despite conflicts with GAC advice. The .xxx top-level domain became available in December 2011. The security and stability of the Internet, particularly regarding DNS vulnerabilities, remains a key concern. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to address vulnerabilities in the DNS system, allowing for the validation of DNS addresses through digital signatures. Deploying DNSSEC on the root zone is a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks on the DNS. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) in 2009 to gather public input on implementing DNSSEC into the Internet's infrastructure. \"Signing the root\" with DNSSEC is crucial for protecting against DNS attacks. NTIA sought public input on DNSSEC deployment in 2009 and collaborated with ICANN and VeriSign on an interim approach. NTIA proceeded with DNSSEC implementation in the root zone in 2010, with ICANN publishing the root zone trust anchor. On June 9, 2010, NTIA filed a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comments on its testing and evaluation report for DNSSEC implementation in the root zone. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor on July 15, 2010, allowing root operators to serve the signed root zone with actual keys. DNSSEC adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide is essential for maximum protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. WHOIS database information accessibility has been a concern for domain name registrants. The WHOIS database contains contact information for domain name registrants, with debates on the accessibility of this information. Privacy advocates argue for limitations, while businesses and government entities advocate for continued public access. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on WHOIS data availability. ICANN's GNSO debated the accessibility of WHOIS information, with privacy advocates supporting limited access. A working definition was approved in April 2006, favoring a narrow technical definition. Opponents continued to push for reconsideration at ICANN's June 2006 meeting. The GNSO debated the accessibility of WHOIS data, with privacy advocates supporting limited access. In October 2007, the GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies. They rejected a proposal to list third party contact information instead of private data. Currently, the GNSO is conducting extensive studies on WHOIS. In June 2011, ICANN initiated four separate studies on WHOIS, recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee in 2008. The GNSO is conducting extensive studies on WHOIS, including examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and the feasibility of a reveal study. A WHOIS policy review team issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, focusing on registrar compliance and data accuracy. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data. The final report on WHOIS issued 16 recommendations for strengthening the system, including improving data accuracy and access. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data. An Expert Working Group released recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is currently developing next steps for implementation. ICANN is developing next steps to implement a new Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. The system aims to address intellectual property concerns related to domain name ownership and registration. WIPO was called upon to develop recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions, which were adopted by ICANN in August 1999. Registrars must follow a uniform dispute resolution policy, except for cases of \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting and cyberpiracy. ICANN's uniform dispute resolution policy requires registrars to wait for instructions from domain-name holders or a court order before taking action on complaints. An exception is made for \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting, which are resolved through a special administrative procedure. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in bad faith, with statutory civil damages of at least $1,000. The 106th Congress passed the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, giving courts authority to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in bad faith. The act also provides for statutory civil damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name identifier. Intellectual property is a key issue in the debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names, with concerns about trademark protection and piracy of online content. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to address online piracy through domain name regulations. ICANN's decisions on DNS management impact various policy issues like intellectual property, privacy, and cybersecurity. The debate over new gTLDs raises concerns about trademark protection and online piracy. Decisions made by ICANN regarding DNS management can have significant impacts on Internet-related policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The key policy question is how to ensure achievement of White Paper principles, including Internet stability and security, competition, and fair representation of the global Internet community. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have led to criticism of the ICANN policymaking process and suggestions to increase governmental influence. Some governments criticize ICANN's policymaking process, suggesting increased governmental influence over Internet policies. Defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for a bottom-up, consensus approach to protect decisions from national governments' control. Defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for a bottom-up, consensus approach to protect Internet policies from governmental control. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN to a multistakeholder-driven entity, evaluating its impact on the United States and the Internet's stability and security. Congress will closely monitor the proposed transition of authority over ICANN to a multistakeholder-driven entity, ensuring a stable, secure, and open DNS free of U.S. government control. They will also assess the potential threat of increased intergovernmental control over the Internet and the effectiveness of government agencies in countering it, with significant implications for ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet's evolution."
