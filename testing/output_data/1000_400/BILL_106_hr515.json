The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children in the United States aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings. The United States leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized countries. A 1997 CDC study found that the rate of unintentional firearms-related deaths for children under 15 in the US was 9 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. Additionally, a study in 1987 revealed that most unintentional gunshot wounds among children in California involve handguns. A study in the June 12, 1996, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association found that unintentional gunshot wounds among children in California most often involve handguns. Another study in December 1995 discovered that children as young as 3 years old have the finger strength to fire most commercially available handguns. Firearms are currently the only products manufactured. The study revealed that young children have the finger strength to fire a high percentage of commonly available handguns. There is strong public support for safety regulations in the firearms industry, as firearms are not subject to minimum safety standards unlike other products in the United States. A study with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy found that 74% of Americans support safety regulations for the firearms industry. It was noted that many trigger locks and safety devices currently available are inadequate in preventing accidental discharge or children from accessing firearms.

Regulations will establish a minimum safety standard for these products, including those permanently installed in handguns.
