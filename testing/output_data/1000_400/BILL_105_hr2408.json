    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face greater social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are at higher risk of violence during after school hours. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, improving various skills, promoting safe environments, preparing students for workforce participation, and providing alternatives to negative activities. The Act defines \"school\" and \"Secretary\" and authorizes a program. The Act defines \"school\" as a public kindergarten, elementary, or secondary school, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Education. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to schools for carrying out specified activities. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Additionally, schools may choose to implement drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation activities. These activities should take place after regular school hours during the school year. A school receiving a grant under this Act must provide activities such as mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, technology training, drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation after regular school hours. The activities should reflect the specific needs of the population, students, and community served, and can involve volunteers from the business and academic communities, donations of computer equipment, and take place in a designated school building or public facility. A school receiving a grant under this Act is encouraged to collaborate with volunteers from the business and academic communities, request donations of computer equipment, and coordinate with State and local park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities.
