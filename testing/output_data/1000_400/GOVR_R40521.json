    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education and related services. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities aged 3 to 21, identify and evaluate all children with disabilities, and create individual education programs (IEPs) for those receiving services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures that children with disabilities aged 3 to 21 receive special education services through individualized education programs (IEPs). Parents are involved in planning and overseeing their child's education, and procedural safeguards are provided, including the right to due process hearings and appeals. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates that children with disabilities be educated alongside non-disabled children, and provides procedural safeguards for them and their parents. IDEA was enacted in 1975 in response to court decisions requiring equal education for children with disabilities. The most recent reauthorization was in 2004, with specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011. Congress is currently considering potential issues for the next reauthorization. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has been reauthorized multiple times, with the most recent reauthorization in 2004 (P.L. 108-446). Congress is currently identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical and requires special education and related services. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical, requiring special education and related services for conditions such as mental retardation, autism, and ADHD. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court assessed whether a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court determined that a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA due to serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments affecting educational performance. The need for special education and related services was emphasized in court decisions. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, the First Circuit Court of Appeals found that a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities significantly impact educational performance. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities significantly impact educational performance. In Board of Education of Montgomery County v. S.G., the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a child with schizophrenia was also considered a child with a disability under IDEA, even though her disability did not adversely affect her school performance. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that a child with ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder was eligible for IDEA services, as her inappropriate behavior did not adversely affect her educational performance. The Fifth Circuit also found no adverse educational effect from a child's ADHD in Alvin Independent School District v. AD. The child's behavior, including ADHD and dysthymic disorder, did not meet the requirements for IDEA eligibility. The courts found no adverse educational effect from the child's conditions. IDEA requires states to submit plans to receive funds, outlining policies and procedures. The Second Circuit found insufficient evidence that the child's educational performance was adversely affected, even if he qualified as seriously emotionally disturbed. IDEA mandates that states must have policies in place to identify, locate, and evaluate children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The ninth circuit ruled in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a ninth grader who struggled academically could be a violation of IDEA's child find requirement. The ninth circuit held in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that a school district failed to meet IDEA's child find requirement by not evaluating a ninth grader who struggled academically. The Supreme Court is considering whether parents can file due process complaints for negligence in failing to provide an educational program for a child with disabilities. A child with a disability has the right to a due process hearing alleging negligence due to school officials' failure to arrange an educational program. The core requirement of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education to receive federal funding. FAPE is defined as special education and related services provided at public expense, meeting state standards, and conforming to an individualized education program. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 clarified the requirements of FAPE under IDEA. It emphasized that the education provided to children with disabilities must confer some educational benefit, even though IDEA does not specify the level of education required. The Supreme Court clarified in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley that education for children with disabilities must provide some educational benefit. This includes access to specialized instruction and support services tailored to the child's needs, meeting state standards and the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). The Supreme Court ruled that education for children with disabilities must provide educational benefit through personalized instruction and support services. The instruction should meet state standards, align with the child's IEP, and enable the child to progress academically. States are not required to maximize each child's potential. The IEP should align with the Act and aim to help the child achieve passing grades and advance in school. States are not obligated to maximize each child's potential, but as long as the child is progressing and making gains, the FAPE requirement is met. The Supreme Court emphasized that courts should not impose their preferred educational methods on states, as the responsibility for education lies with state and local agencies. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits is a challenging task under the Act. The Supreme Court emphasized that courts should not impose their preferred educational methods on states, as the responsibility for education lies with state and local agencies. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits is a challenging task under the Act. Rowley remains a key decision under IDEA, with lower courts interpreting it variably in supporting schools' IEPs if procedural requirements are met. The lower courts have varied in interpreting Rowley under IDEA, with some supporting schools' IEPs even if educational progress is minimal. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the court held the IEP was adequate despite low reading scores. Some courts have emphasized that IDEA should provide meaningful education benefits. The court noted the child's progress despite low reading scores, with some dissenting opinions questioning the quality of education under IDEA. Different courts have varying interpretations of IDEA, with some requiring more than minimal educational benefit in IEPs. In Intermediate Unit 16, the Third Circuit clarified that an IEP must provide more than minimal educational benefit, as stated in Rowley. The Fifth Circuit in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. emphasized the need for meaningful educational benefits in an IEP. The Cypress-Fairbanks court outlined four factors to assess this standard. Other courts have considered academic testing and grades to evaluate educational benefit, as seen in Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District. The courts have different criteria for determining if a student has received a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) under IDEA. Academic achievement testing and grades are considered, as seen in Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District. In Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit emphasized that for a child with above-average intelligence, IDEA requires more than a negligible benefit. Procedural violations do not always result in a FAPE violation. In Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit emphasized that IDEA requires more than a negligible benefit for a child with above-average intelligence. Procedural violations may not always lead to a FAPE violation, as they must affect the child's substantive rights. Certain violations, such as delayed implementation of IEP services or inaccessible facilities, may not necessarily violate FAPE if there is general program accessibility. Additionally, a resolution session improperly convened may not violate FAPE if it does not substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. In N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, the Ninth Circuit found a denial of FAPE when the school failed to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability. Another denial of FAPE occurred when the LEA unilaterally scheduled an IEP meeting without mutual agreement with parents. The application of the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current controversies is somewhat confused due to changes in the usage of the term \"educational standards.\" The Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley is somewhat confused by changes in the usage of the term \"educational standards.\" The term now refers to specific content-based standards outlining what a child should know and be able to do. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA reflected this shift towards standards-based education. P.L. 105-17 significantly changed IEP requirements to include a statement of the child's present level of performance. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA reflected the standards-based education movement, requiring IEPs to include present levels of educational performance, measurable annual goals, and access to the general curriculum for children with disabilities. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasized high expectations for children with disabilities and their access to the general curriculum. Questions have been raised about the current application of FAPE requirements due to changes in standards brought by the No Child Left Behind Act. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research. This ensures the quality of information meets field standards before publication. The final regulations indicate that peer-reviewed research must meet field standards before publication. In a court case, it was found that an eclectic approach in an IEP satisfied IDEA requirements, even if not based on peer-reviewed research. The court found that an eclectic approach in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) satisfied IDEA requirements, even if not based on peer-reviewed research. The court emphasized that imposing preferred educational methods on states should be avoided. IDEA outlines specific requirements for an IEP, including present levels of achievement, annual goals, services provided, and goal attainment methods. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a key component of IDEA, outlining academic goals, services, and educational benefits for children with disabilities. Judicial decisions focus on compliance with IDEA procedures and the effectiveness of the IEP in providing educational benefits. Judicial decisions focus on compliance with IDEA procedures and the effectiveness of the IEP in providing educational benefits. Courts use the Rowley two-part inquiry to assess IEPs, which must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits. Flaws in an IEP may not violate IDEA if they do not compromise the child's right to an appropriate education or deprive them of educational benefits. The Eighth Circuit court of appeals found that despite some flaws in the child's IEP, it did not compromise his right to an appropriate education or deprive him of educational benefits, thus no violation of IDEA. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Cabouli v. Chappaqua Central School District determined that evidence supporting the adequacy of the IEP indicated the child would likely make educational progress, also no violation of IDEA. Lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not invalidate it, as shown in Nack v. Orange City School District where procedural violations without substantive harm were not considered a violation of IDEA. The Sixth Circuit in Nack v. Orange City School District found that procedural violations without substantive harm do not violate IDEA. Lack of progress in one school year does not necessarily indicate an IDEA violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success but requires sufficient specialized services for benefit. Conversely, courts have ruled that an IEP failing to provide educational benefits violates IDEA, as seen in cases like A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board and M.L. v. Federal Way School District. In A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board, the Fourth Circuit ruled that an IEP lacking educational benefits violates IDEA. The Ninth Circuit also found in M.L. v. Federal Way School District that excluding a regular education teacher from the IEP team denies FAPE. However, in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA does not mandate the child's current special education teacher's participation. Parental input in the IEP is limited according to recent court decisions. The Fourth Circuit ruled in A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board that an IEP lacking educational benefits violates IDEA. The Ninth Circuit found in M.L. v. Federal Way School District that excluding a regular education teacher from the IEP team denies FAPE. However, in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA does not mandate the child's current special education teacher's participation. Recent court decisions have limited parental input in the IEP process. In Lessard and Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District, the First Circuit ruled that an IEP was not deficient due to incompleteness. Courts have sided with parents in IEP cases, such as in County School Board of York County v. A.L. where lack of notice and failure to inform parents of due process rights violated IDEA. Violations of procedural requirements were also found when a school determined a child's placement before an IEP meeting. The Fourth Circuit found violations of IDEA due to lack of prior notice, failure to inform parents of due process rights, and determining a child's placement before an IEP meeting. Scheduling an IEP meeting without considering parents' availability and denying a request to reschedule denied the student FAPE. IDEA requires a free appropriate public education, including special education and related services like transportation, speech-language pathology, and therapy. FAPE is defined as requiring special education and related services, including transportation, speech-language pathology, therapy, counseling, and medical services for diagnostic purposes. It aims to enable children with disabilities to benefit from special education and includes early identification of disabling conditions. Related services under IDEA include counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for diagnostic and evaluation purposes to assist children with disabilities in benefiting from special education. Two Supreme Court cases have addressed the provision of medical services, such as in Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, where the court ruled that services impacting both medical and educational needs must be provided under IDEA if necessary for a child with a disability requiring special education. The Supreme Court case of Tatro involved a girl with spina bifida needing clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), ruling that schools must provide such services under IDEA if necessary for a child with a disability requiring special education. The decision emphasized that non-physicians could provide certain services, setting a precedent for future court cases. After the Tatro case, some courts did not strictly follow the distinction between services requiring a doctor and those that could be provided by non-physicians. This led to the 1999 Supreme Court case Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., involving a paralyzed child who needed extensive services like tracheotomy tube suction and manual air pumping. The school proposed a test for related services based on factors like continuity and cost, which was challenged by the parents. The school denied the parents' request for services for a paralyzed child needing extensive medical care, including tracheotomy tube suction and manual air pumping. The Court rejected the proposed test for related services, stating that the medical services exclusion only applied to physicians or hospitals. The 2004 reauthorization addressed this issue by establishing risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. States can reserve funds to provide these services. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA established risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds to assist LEAs serving these children. Recent IDEA cases have focused on defining required services for children with disabilities to benefit from special education, emphasizing inclusion with non-disabled peers. The federal court has broad discretion to define services needed for children with disabilities to benefit from special education, following the IDEA requirement for inclusive education with supplementary aids and services. Recent court decisions use a two-pronged approach to determine the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities. The federal court uses a two-pronged approach to determine the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities, as outlined in Daniel R.R. v. State Board of Education. Factors considered include accommodation efforts, educational benefits, and impact on other students. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the effect of a child with a disability on other students. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the impact of a child with disabilities on other students in a regular classroom. The court noted disruptive behaviors such as loud vocalizations, removal of shoes and socks, inappropriate clapping and grinding teeth, toileting difficulties, and inappropriate touching. Despite these disruptions, the court upheld the decision that the child could not be satisfactorily educated full time in a regular classroom. Congress enacted P.L. 94-142, providing grants to states for education of children with disabilities under IDEA. The court upheld the decision that the student could not be educated full time in a regular classroom under IDEA. P.L. 94-142 provided grants to states for children with disabilities and included a \"stay put\" provision to prevent discriminatory practices. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA ensures that a child with disabilities remains in their current educational placement during disputes. The concept was included to prevent discriminatory practices like expelling disabled children from school. The Supreme Court case of Honig v. Doe in 1988 addressed the issue of exceptions to the \"stay put\" rule for emotionally disturbed children involved in disruptive behavior. The Supreme Court case of Honig v. Doe in 1988 dealt with the issue of exceptions to the \"stay put\" rule for emotionally disturbed children engaging in disruptive behavior. The Court ruled that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, but can temporarily suspend them for up to 10 days if they pose a safety threat. The Honig case in 1988 addressed exceptions to the \"stay put\" rule for emotionally disturbed children. Schools can temporarily suspend students for up to 10 days if they pose a safety threat. The Honig injunction allows schools to seek judicial relief in cases where parents refuse to change placement for a dangerous child. Congress later amended IDEA to allow schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative setting if they bring a firearm to school. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's \"stay put\" provision to allow schools to unilaterally remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting if they bring a firearm to school. This provision was later expanded to include weapons, drugs, and situations where a student inflicts serious bodily injury on another person at school. The stay put requirement has also been debated in cases involving transitions from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The stay put provision in IDEA has been debated in cases involving transitions from Part C to Part B. The Third Circuit held that the provision requires the child to continue receiving services until disputes are resolved, while the Eleventh Circuit disagreed. The stay put provision in IDEA has been debated in cases involving transitions from Part C to Part B. The Third Circuit held that the provision requires the child to continue receiving services until disputes are resolved, while the Eleventh Circuit disagreed on whether children applying for initial admission are entitled to continue receiving services. Other issues include mediation, private school placement, resource room to classroom transitions, and the appeals process. Sammons v. Polk County School Board raised the question of whether a mediation request invokes the stay put provision, with the Eleventh Circuit limiting its application to the pendency of administrative or judicial proceedings. In Sammons v. Polk County School Board, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the stay put provision in IDEA does not apply to requests for mediation. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit determined that a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents cannot use the stay put provision to continue private school placement. E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken addressed a situation where a district contested the IEP team's recommendation for private school placement. In E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court held that the \"stay put\" provision applied to the placement for the preceding school year. The Ninth Circuit in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District ruled that the stay put provision applies throughout the appeals process. However, a novel application of the stay put provision failed in N.D. v. State of Hawaii due to fiscal concerns. In N.D. v. State of Hawaii, a novel application of the stay put provision failed due to fiscal concerns. The state decided to furlough teachers and shut down public schools for 17 Fridays, resulting in a 10% reduction in instruction days. Plaintiffs alleged a violation of the stay put provision, but the Ninth Circuit found no violation, stating it does not cover system-wide changes affecting children with disabilities. The Ninth Circuit found no violation of the stay put provision in IDEA, stating it does not cover system-wide changes in public schools. Congressional interest in the use of seclusion and restraints led to the passing of the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act\" in the House. IDEA emphasizes positive behavioral interventions for children with disabilities but does not specifically address the use of seclusion and restraints. The Department of Education has stated that while IDEA emphasizes positive behavioral interventions for children with disabilities, it does not flatly prohibit the use of mechanical restraints or aversive techniques. State laws may address the use of restraints, but the critical consideration is whether they align with the child's IEP and the use of positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed this issue. The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA. In Honig v. Doe, the Court examined IDEA's requirements for children with violent behavior, holding that a suspension longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. Educators can use \"normal procedures\" like study carrels, timeouts, detention, or restriction of privileges, along with a ten-day suspension. Despite the lack of specific language in IDEA regarding the use of restraints, it does not prohibit their use if consistent with the child's IEP and positive behavioral interventions. In Honig v. Doe, the Court addressed the use of seclusion and restraints under IDEA, allowing educators to use \"normal procedures\" like study carrels, timeouts, detention, or restriction of privileges, along with a ten-day suspension. Despite the lack of specific language in IDEA, cases have alleged violations of a child's right to education due to the use of restraints and seclusion. Courts have generally not found violations of IDEA when these measures are necessary for safety or when the child is progressing academically with tailored IEPs. Courts have examined whether the administrative exhaustion requirements of IDEA apply in situations involving the use of seclusion and restraint. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, the child's IEP allowed for the use of seclusion and restraint when necessary for safety, but the parents alleged improper and excessive use. The parents withdrew their daughter from the school and requested a due process hearing, challenging the adequacy of educational services. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case, stating that dissatisfaction with education must be addressed through proper channels. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of a case where parents challenged the adequacy of educational services. They withdrew their daughter from the school and requested a due process hearing. IDEA was also used by parents to challenge a New York State regulation banning \"aversive interventions.\" The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction in this case. The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against a New York State regulation banning \"aversive interventions.\" The district court upheld the regulations, stating they were informed and rational, consistent with the purposes of IDEA. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE, although not explicitly prohibited in IDEA. The regulations on the use of aversives are considered rational and consistent with IDEA. Disability harassment may lead to a denial of FAPE, with courts finding that severe harassment can violate IDEA. Claims of harassment must be tied to IDEA and exhaustion of administrative remedies may be required for retaliation claims. The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act can also lead to actions alleging retaliation for advocating violations of IDEA. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act may give rise to actions alleging retaliation for advocacy alleging violations of IDEA. Several circuits have held that protecting the rights of special education students is a protected activity under the Rehabilitation Act. Section 615 of IDEA provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including notice of rights, mediation, resolution sessions, and due process procedures. Parents or schools can file a due process complaint regarding a denial of FAPE. Procedural safeguards under IDEA protect the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Parents or schools can file a due process complaint within two years of knowing about a violation. The 2004 reauthorization allows schools to also file complaints. After an administrative decision, aggrieved parties have 90 days to file suit in district court. The 2004 reauthorization added a requirement for resolution sessions before due process proceedings. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows schools to file complaints. After an administrative decision, aggrieved parties have 90 days to file suit in district court. A resolution session involving parents, IEP team members, and a representative of the local educational agency is required before due process hearings. Mediation provisions were added in the 1997 reauthorization and judicial enforcement of agreements from resolution sessions or mediation was provided in the 2004 reauthorization. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows schools to file complaints and provides for a resolution session involving parents, IEP team members, and a representative of the local educational agency before due process hearings. Judicial enforcement of agreements from resolution sessions or mediation was also included in the 2004 reauthorization. Several court decisions have addressed issues related to the resolution session, including confidentiality and the presence of attorneys. Confidentiality and resolution session discussions are not settlement discussions. Court decisions have addressed the presence of attorneys in resolution sessions, with limitations only for the preliminary meeting. Procedural violations in resolution sessions do not violate FAPE unless they substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. Courts generally limit judicial enforcement to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation. Courts generally limit judicial enforcement to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation. In Amy S. v. Danbury, the Sixth Circuit held that mediation agreements signed by parents, represented by counsel, precluded a claim. The court rejected an argument in Ballard v. Philadelphia School District that a settlement agreement was invalid under IDEA. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination that a due process complaint did not meet IDEA's pleading requirements. The court quoted from the Senate report stating that the determination of compliance with statutory requirements should be made on the face of the complaint, with no hearing or appeal allowed. The district court referenced the Senate report language stating that the determination of due process complaint notice compliance should be made on the face of the complaint, with no hearing or appeal allowed. The court found it troubling that a state official's dismissal of a complaint based on federal law appears to be unreviewable in federal court. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal without prejudice. Several courts have addressed whether an LEA can sue an SEA for IDEA non-compliance. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action without prejudice. Courts have addressed whether an LEA can bring an action against an SEA for IDEA non-compliance, finding that IDEA does not allow such a private right of action. The Sixth Circuit held that LEAs do not have statutory authority to challenge a state agency's noncompliance with IDEA's procedural safeguards. The Ninth Circuit also limited complaints to matters related to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child. The court found that IDEA limits complaints to issues regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court ruled that parents can bring suit in court without an attorney for their own rights under IDEA. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court held that parents without attorneys can bring pro se suits for their own rights under IDEA. The Court determined that IDEA grants parents enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, including a child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized the importance of considering the entire statutory scheme of IDEA to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents. The Court examined IDEA's statutory language, emphasizing the rights of children with disabilities and parents. Procedural rights were established to protect these rights, including both procedural and substantive rights for parents. Justice Kennedy highlighted that IDEA provides rights for parents as well as children. The Court found that IDEA provides rights for parents as well as children, encompassing both procedural and substantive rights. Concerns about increased costs to states due to potential lawsuits from parents were deemed insufficient to argue that IDEA failed to provide clear notice under the Constitution's Spending Clause. The Supreme Court emphasized that IDEA provides rights for both parents and children, including the ability for courts to award attorneys' fees to educational agencies in certain circumstances. Non-attorney parents can assert their own claims and enforce FAPE, surviving legal challenges. The Supreme Court's emphasis on parental rights allows non-attorney parents to assert their own claims and enforce FAPE. However, parents cannot use their rights to circumvent existing consent decrees. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, the Third Circuit ruled that claims must be personal to the parents to be valid. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, the Third Circuit dismissed parents' claims as not personal to them. Parental rights under Winkelman extend to Section 504, ADA, and IDEA cases, but not all courts agree. D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District found Winkelman not applicable to Section 504 and ADA cases. Other parental rights issues are not directly tied to Winkelman. In Blanchard v. Morton School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that money damages were not available under IDEA for a child with a disability. The Second Circuit addressed noncustodial parent rights in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City. IDEA defines the term \"parent,\" with regulations stating a parent is presumed to be the parent unless proven otherwise. The Second Circuit in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City addressed the rights of a noncustodial parent in making educational decisions for a child with disabilities under IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The court emphasized that the noncustodial biological parent did not have legal authority to make such decisions. IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA are federal statutes addressing the education rights of individuals with disabilities. IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides additional programs for children with disabilities. Section 504 and the ADA, civil rights statutes enacted in 1973 and 1990, prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA was modeled after Section 504, but Section 504 only applies to entities receiving federal funding. The ADA and Section 504 are civil rights statutes that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. While Section 504 applies to entities receiving federal funds, the ADA has broader coverage. The interaction of these statutes in educational settings has been subject to court scrutiny, with differences in coverage noted. The ADA and Section 504 protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. Courts have examined the interaction of these statutes in education, noting differences in coverage. IDEA includes due process requirements for FAPE provision, with the burden of proof clarified in the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing was clarified in the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast, where the Supreme Court held that the party seeking relief bears the burden of proof. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments for placing the burden on the school system, stating that it should lie with the party seeking relief unless Congress intended otherwise. In the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast, the Supreme Court clarified that the burden of proof falls on the party seeking relief in an IDEA due process hearing. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments for placing the burden on the school system, stating that it should lie with the party seeking relief unless Congress intended otherwise. The Court noted that IDEA provides parents with various rights to ensure fairness in the process. The Supreme Court clarified in Schaffer v. Weast that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing falls on the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor emphasized the rights of parents under IDEA, including the right to review records, independent evaluation, disclosure of evaluations and recommendations, and potential reimbursement of attorneys' fees. This ensures fairness and equal access to information between parents and schools. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools and funding responsibilities remain contentious under IDEA. Children with disabilities in private schools under IDEA can be placed by the LEA/SEA or parents, with costs covered by the LEA/SEA or subject to reimbursement. IDEA mandates some services for children in private schools, even if unilaterally placed by parents. The IDEA requires services for children in private schools, even if parents unilaterally place them there. Reimbursement for private school placement may be required if the public agency did not provide a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. The IDEA may require reimbursement for private school enrollment if the public agency fails to provide timely free appropriate public education. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed tuition reimbursement for parents who place their child in a private school without prior special education from the public school. In a 2007 decision, the Supreme Court allowed private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability, even if the child had not received special education services from the public school. This decision did not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unsettled. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA authorized reimbursement for private school tuition. The Supreme Court held in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Recent lower court decisions have stated that as long as the child is making educational progress with an IEP from the public school, they are not entitled to a private school placement. Recent lower court decisions have held that if a child is making educational progress with a public school's IEP, they are not entitled to a private school placement. This was exemplified in M.H. and J.H. v. Monroe-Woodbury Central School District, where parents were denied tuition reimbursement for a private school placement because the child's IEP was deemed adequate. Similar standards apply when parents want to place their child in a different private school. If a private school fails to meet the child's needs, the court may not require tuition reimbursement. Courts may not require private school tuition reimbursement if the private school does not adequately address the child's educational needs. Reimbursement is also barred if parents do not notify the LEA of problems with their child's IDEA services or act unreasonably with the school. Parents are not barred from private school tuition reimbursement if the private school placement is appropriate. If parents arrange for private school educational services without notifying the LEA of their problems with their child's IDEA services, reimbursement is barred. Reimbursement is also not allowed if parents act unreasonably with the school or if the allegation concerns procedural violations that do not rise to a level of substantive harm. However, parents are not barred from private school tuition reimbursement if the child has not previously received special education services. If a school district is found to have deprived a child with a disability of FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education is the award of prospective educational services designed to compensate for a previous inadequate program. Compensatory education is awarded to compensate for inadequate programs, stemming from the 1985 Supreme Court ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v.
