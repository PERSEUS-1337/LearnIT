    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" Congress finds that the United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, with studies showing that access to high-quality prekindergarten programs leads to academic success and reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes such as grade repetition, dropout, and criminal behavior. Public spending on prekindergarten programs yields a significant return on investment through reduced need for other services. Children who attend prekindergarten have lower chances of developing drug problems, committing felonies, and going to prison. They also have higher GPAs, are more likely to attend college, but many school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs. Texas missed out on significant federal funding to expand prekindergarten programs due to budget cuts in education funding. In response to education funding cuts in Texas, some local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs after the state legislature cut $5.4 billion in education funding and eliminated $200 million in grants for prekindergarten programs. Over half of school districts with prekindergarten programs offer only part-day programs, leading to missed federal funding of up to $118.48 million for program expansion. Certain localities would benefit from direct federal funding for prekindergarten programs. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS.\" is about a specific section related to prekindergarten development grants.

To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State, local educational agency, or other local government entity must contribute non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount. This matching requirement can be met through various sources such as State funding, local funding, philanthropy, in-kind contributions, or a combination of these resources.
