    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, relationship to other payments, emergency requirements, mandatory livestock market reporting, and regulations. Congress finds that recent changes in the marketing relationships of swine producers with meat packers have adversely affected swine prices. The concentration of the meat packing industry and the increase in live swine imports have reduced slaughter capacity and impacted swine prices in the United States. Additionally, a swine market price crisis occurred from October 1, 1998, to December 31, 1998, due to these factors. The swine market price crisis in the United States from October 1, 1998, to December 31, 1998, was influenced by a 10% increase in swine available for slaughter, an 8% decrease in packer slaughter capacity, and a 37% increase in Canadian swine imports. This led to the lowest live swine prices in the United States spot market for the 20th century during the fourth quarter of 1998. During the fourth quarter of 1998, there was a 37 percent increase in Canadian swine imports into the United States. Swine producers experienced a significant reduction in equity capital investment, with the lowest live swine prices in the United States spot market for the 20th century. Additionally, swine producers' share of the consumer pork dollar was approximately $0.22 in 1998, marking the first year they received less than 30 percent of the consumer dollar spent on pork products. In 1998, swine producers received only $0.22 of the consumer pork dollar, marking the first time they received less than 30 percent of the total spent on pork products. Despite stable retail prices, pork consumption increased by seven percent, making it the only meat protein with a net per capita consumption increase over the previous year. The purpose of the Act is to compensate swine producers for losses incurred due to adverse economic factors in the swine market in the fourth quarter of 1998. The Act aims to compensate swine producers for losses in the fourth quarter of 1998 due to adverse economic factors and government failures in pursuing foreign trade opportunities.
