Key differences from the Administration request include an additional $4.4 billion in highway funding and the deletion of $3.4 billion for airport grants-in-aid due to a point of order. Congress is now considering appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury together. The FY2004 budget consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, and other agencies into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This reorganization also led to the merging of subcommittees for Transportation and Treasury into one committee. The FY2004 budget consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, and other agencies into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This led to the reorganization of subcommittees in the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, creating new subcommittees for Homeland Security and combining former Transportation and Treasury subcommittees. The Department of Homeland Security absorbed various agencies from Transportation and Treasury, as well as the Office of Homeland Security from the Executive Office of the President. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison with previous years' appropriations. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles.

The Treasury Department has historically performed key functions related to economic, financial, tax, and fiscal policies. The Treasury Department historically performed key functions related to economic, financial, tax, and fiscal policies. However, with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, its role in law enforcement has become more limited. The Treasury Department's functional profile changed significantly in 2003 due to an executive order. While it still serves as a key economic policymaker and financial manager, its role in law enforcement is now limited. The Department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with the bureaus mainly handling financial responsibilities. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus handle specific duties, accounting for over 95% of employment and funding. They can be categorized into those with financial responsibilities and those involved in law enforcement. The IRS is an exception, performing both financial and law enforcement duties. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), U.S. Secret Service, and U.S. Customs Service, handle law enforcement duties. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) performs financial and law enforcement duties through federal tax laws administration. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reduced the Treasury Department's involvement in law enforcement, with certain agencies being transferred to DHS and the Justice Department.

The report briefly discusses general provisions related to government-wide policies such as the Buy America Act and drug-free federal workplaces. The curr_chunk discusses general provisions related to government-wide policies such as the Buy America Act and drug-free federal workplaces, as well as authorizing agencies to pay GSA bills for space renovation. These provisions are annually incorporated into the Treasury and General Government appropriations legislation, with new or modified policies found in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Administration's proposed language for government-wide general provisions can be found in the Appendix. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, includes new or modified policies and general provisions related to government-wide policies. The Administration's proposed language for general provisions can be found in the Appendix. Congress prefers reiterating language rather than placing provisions in permanent law. The Administration recommended dropping several provisions, including General Schedule Pay adjustments. The Administration recommended dropping several provisions related to General Schedule Pay adjustments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, enacted an average 4.1% increase, retroactive to January 1, 2004, which includes a 2% adjustment. Federal white-collar employees under the General Schedule are to receive annual adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries. Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990, federal white collar employees paid under the General Schedule receive annual adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries. The base pay adjustment for January 2003 was 3.1%, with an additional 1% increase for a total of 4.1% under Section 637, Division J, P.L. 108-7. The President signed an Executive Order establishing salary schedules for federal civilian personnel effective January 2003, with a 4.1% pay increase for the General Schedule. An additional 1% increase was retroactively applied to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed, with an alternative plan of a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. The President's plan took effect due to Congress not completing legislation for other rates. In 2004, the President proposed a federal civilian pay increase of 2.0% in January. Congress did not pass legislation for other rates, so the President's plan went into effect. The House and Senate passed a bill for a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees, equal to the military, with the President deciding how to split the increase between basic and locality pay. This provision is in the pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004. The House and Senate proposed a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees in January 2004, with the President deciding how to split it between basic and locality pay. The Office of Personnel Management stated that 2.7% would go towards basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. The net rates of adjustment for the Washington, DC area were 2.12% under the overall 2% adjustment and will be 4.41% under the overall 4.1% adjustment. Congress has limited the rates of adjustment for FWS wages in high-cost areas to prevent them from exceeding salaries paid to General Schedule supervisors. In recent years, Congress has limited the adjustment rates for Federal Wage System (FWS) wages to prevent them from surpassing General Schedule supervisors' salaries. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. Additionally, there are proposed changes to the salary levels for the Senior Executive Service. The President's proposed General Provisions seek to amend the statute governing salary levels for Senior Executive Service personnel in the Department of Defense. The changes include eliminating the six-tier system, transferring salary setting authority to the Office of Personnel Management, and capping rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule. Effective January 2004, minimum pay is $103,700 and maximum is $145,600, with a potential increase to $158,100 for those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems. The Administration's FY2004 pay proposal includes a 2% across-the-board increase and a $500 million fund for rewarding top-performing individuals with permanent base pay increases. There are no provisions addressing the pay of Members of Congress, Judges, or other federal officials in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions. If Congress is silent, the annual adjustment goes into effect automatically. Members of Congress, Judges, and other federal officials are set to receive a pay adjustment of 2.2% effective January 2004, with the full adjustment being retroactive. The rate was initially limited to 1.5% until the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. An amendment to deny the pay increase to Members of Congress was tabled by the Senate in October 2003. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, was initially limited to 1.5% but will now be 2.2% retroactively effective January 2004. An amendment to deny the pay increase to Members of Congress was tabled by the Senate in October 2003. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, was limited to 1.5% initially but will now be 2.2% retroactively effective January 2004. The mechanism for adjusting salaries is automatic, with no bill language necessary. Judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases, as enacted in P.L. 108-167. President's pay adjustment was established in P.L. 106-58. P.L. 108-167 was enacted to authorize pay adjustments for judges in January 2004. Presidents now receive a salary of $400,000 per annum since January 20, 2001. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to each employing agency. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to each employing agency, aiming to make agencies bear the full cost of employees' claims and improve workplace safety. The administrative surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, mainly paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to each employing agency, aiming to make agencies bear the full cost of employees' claims and improve workplace safety. The surcharge would be mainly paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department, with the Administration supporting competitive sourcing and potentially vetoing any bill that hinders it. The President's senior advisers would recommend vetoing a bill with a prohibition on funding for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered competitive sourcing provisions in H.R.2989. Competitive sourcing is part of the President's Management Agenda, with initiatives implemented since February 2001 to promote it. Circular A-76 provides guidance for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing as part of the President's Management Agenda. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with competitive sourcing provisions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673. This section places conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). The Department of Transportation and Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill of 2004 would impose two conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. First, agencies must develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO), which is required by Circular A-76 for standard competitions but not for streamlined competitions. Second, Section 647(a) would also require consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which is not used in streamlined competitions under Circular A-76. The Department of Transportation and Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill of 2004 imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. Agencies must develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) as required by Circular A-76 for standard competitions. Additionally, Section 647(a) requires consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which is not used in streamlined competitions under Circular A-76. Section 647(a) directs the competitive sourcing official to consider the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, comparing contractor costs to agency costs. The criteria for cost comparison and the impact of the conversion differential on performance decisions are unclear. It is uncertain if the official's consideration could override a performance decision. The CSO should compare contractor performance costs to agency costs in streamlined competitions. It is unclear if the conversion differential could impact performance decisions. For standard competitions, agencies must add the conversion differential to the non-incumbent's performance cost as required by Circular A-76. Executive agencies must submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities as per Section 647(b). The Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on their competitive sourcing activities. Reports must include completed and ongoing competitions, costs, savings, FTEs, and decision-making processes to aid congressional oversight. The Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on their competitive sourcing activities, including costs, savings, FTEs, and decision-making processes. Agency reports could inform OMB policy and guidance, but the absence of a methodology for collecting required information may reduce usefulness and increase costs. Agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation issued to an MEO to five years or less. Under Section 647(c), agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation issued to an MEO to five years or less. This flexibility could result in less frequent recompetitions, potentially affecting government agencies and private sector sources differently. Contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under the FAR, while agencies writing letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could mitigate potential issues. The Circular A-76 allows contractors to be recompeted under the FAR after winning public-private competitions. Allowing agencies to issue letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could address recruitment and retention concerns among federal employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities post-competition, enhancing oversight efforts. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities post-competition, supporting oversight efforts and enhancing agency decision-making. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work converted to contractor performance outside the United States if previously performed by federal government employees within the country, potentially impacting contractors' ability to prepare competitive bids. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work converted to contractor performance outside the United States if previously performed by federal government employees within the country. This provision could impact contractors' ability to prepare competitive bids, potentially helping to retain jobs for U.S. residents and benefiting employers with a workforce in close proximity to their facilities in the United States. (117) The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill had provisions preventing funds from enforcing travel restrictions, but they were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, which included seven regular appropriations acts, dropped two Cuba provisions from the House version of the bill. The White House threatened to veto any legislation that weakened economic sanctions against Cuba, which have been in place since the early 1960s to isolate the Communist government of Fidel Castro. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the Communist government of Fidel Castro through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and restrictions on financial transactions and travel. Congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996 strengthened these sanctions. Recent controversy surrounds Cuba sanctions, with proposals in the 108th Congress to lift or ease restrictions. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) govern travel to Cuba, with ongoing debates in Congress about lifting or easing sanctions. Different approaches are suggested, from maximum pressure on the Cuban government to lifting some sanctions to normalize U.S.-Cuban relations. The House-approved H.R. 2929 includes three provisions related to Cuba. Different approaches are suggested to address the Cuban government, from maximum pressure to lifting some sanctions. The House-approved H.R. 2929 includes provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions and remittances. Restrictions on travel have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. The House-approved H.R. 2929 includes provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba. Certain categories of travelers may visit Cuba under a general license, including U.S. government officials, journalists, and individuals with close relatives in Cuba. Certain categories of travelers, including U.S. government officials, journalists, persons with close relatives in Cuba, professionals for research or meetings, and athletes in international competitions, do not need special permission from OFAC to visit Cuba. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of Americans to travel and that such travel can promote freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents argue that not enforcing travel restrictions would benefit the Cuban government financially. The Delahunt amendment, approved by a vote of 222-196, aimed to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on remittances to Cuba. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. The Delahunt amendment, passed by a vote of 222-196, aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances to Cuba. Supporters argued for unlimited financial support for Cuban Americans to send to their families, while opponents feared more money going to the Cuban regime through government-owned stores with inflated prices. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis), approved 246-173, would have prohibited funds from eliminating people-to-people educational exchanges in Cuba. In March 2003, OFAC tightened Cuba travel regulations, restricting certain types of educational travel. Some groups supported the restrictions, while others criticized the decision to limit travel opportunities for ordinary people. The Senate approved S.Amdt. 1900 (Dorgan) to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel. The provision was similar to the Flake amendment in the House version, with a slight difference in the effective date. The Senate provision, similar to the Flake amendment in the House version, was defeated in a vote. Momentum for easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. Amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support compared to previous years. The Flake amendment to the bill was approved with a narrower margin than a similar amendment in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved with less support than a similar amendment in 2002, with a vote of 227-188. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31740 and CRS Report RL31139. Key acronyms include ARC, AIP, AIR21, ARAA, ATSA, BRR, and BTS. The curr_chunk contains key acronyms related to various transportation programs and agencies such as FAA, FHWA, FRA, and FTA under the Department of Transportation. These acronyms represent different legislations and programs like EAS, CMAQ, and Hazmat. The curr_chunk lists key acronyms related to transportation programs and agencies, including FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HTF, ITS, NHS, NHTSA, and O&M. These acronyms represent various legislations and programs within the Department of Transportation. The curr_chunk provides a list of key acronyms related to transportation programs and agencies, including FMCSA, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, and TEA-21. These acronyms represent various programs within the Department of Transportation. The FAA's Small Community Air Service Development program, Surface Transportation Board, Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, and Transportation Security Administration are all part of the DOT's funding sources, which include transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded mainly by transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and airport trust fund, are funded by specific taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit programs receiving the largest share of DOT appropriations. Highway and transit programs are funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund. Trust funds make up a significant portion of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest component of DOT appropriations. Contract authority linked to the highway trust fund allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year, without the need for new appropriations. This unique budgeting arrangement sets transportation funding apart from other federal programs. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget, linking annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund. Core highway and mass transit program funding was given special status in the discretionary portion of the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA). The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) established a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA) to provide additional highway funds annually. However, for FY2003, the RABA adjustment would have led to a significant drop in highway obligational funding if left intact during the appropriations process. TEA-21 changed the role of the House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The appropriations committees are no longer able to set an annual level of obligations, as these are now adjusted by an annual RABA computation. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) established Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust annual highway funds. TEA-21 changed the role of appropriations committees in setting spending levels for highway and transit programs. The FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts attempted to regain some discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding earmarked projects. The FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts aimed to regain discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding earmarked projects. The trend continued in the FY2002 Act with major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to ineligible agencies. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) guarantees Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program spending, differing from TEA-21. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) provides a guarantee for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program spending, different from TEA-21. FAIR21 relies on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate, leading to increased spending on aviation programs in FY2001 and FY2002. However, the guarantees under FAIR21 are considered weaker than those under TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration, giving transportation appropriators total control. FAIR21 guarantees for FAA program spending grew significantly in FY2001 and FY2002, but are seen as weaker than TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration, giving transportation appropriators control over TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies' funding. Transportation budgeting involves a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. Transportation budgeting uses a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Contract authority does not involve entering into a contract to pay for a project at a future date but controls outlays to correspond with congressional budget agreements. Authorized funds are automatically allocated under Title 23 U.S.C., as amended by TEA-21. The limitation on obligations controls outlays to align with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority under Title 23 U.S.C., as amended by TEA-21, provides funds to states at the start of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. TEA-21 reduced the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999-FY2003. Highway and transit grant programs operate on a reimbursable basis, with states paying upfront for projects and receiving federal payments upon completion. TEA-21 limited appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999-FY2003. States pay upfront for projects and receive federal payments upon completion, leading to high trust fund balances due to ongoing commitments. Highway and transit accounts have both short- and long-term commitments, including payments for completed projects in the current fiscal year. Trust fund balances appear high due to ongoing commitments for current and future projects in the highway and transit accounts. Apportionments distribute funds to states for formula-driven programs, while allocated funds are distributed for specific projects. Unobligated amounts are dedicated to projects but not yet committed. The terms apportionments and allocated funds are associated with distributing contract authority funds to states and programs. Apportionments are for formula-driven programs like the national highway system, while allocated funds are distributed administratively for programs under federal control. These terms provide a reference for highway program recipients, who may mistakenly view state apportionments as part of the federal budget."
