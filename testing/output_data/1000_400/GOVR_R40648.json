    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care, increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House Ways and Means Committee has suggested funding the reform through a surtax on high-income individuals. The House Ways and Means Committee proposed financing health care reform through a surtax on high-income individuals. The Senate Finance Committee suggested an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. President Obama's compromise proposal, based on H.R. 3590, includes changes to revenue provisions and delays the tax on high-cost employer plans. The Senate passed H.R. 3590 on December 24, 2009, reflecting revenue-raising provisions. President Obama proposed changes to the bill, delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans to 2018 and raising exemption thresholds. The new plan also includes a 3.8% tax on unearned income for high-income households. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 on March 22, 2010, with the President signing H.R. 3590 into law on March 23. The Senate passed H.R. 3590 on December 24, 2009, with revenue-raising provisions. President Obama proposed changes, including a 3.8% tax on unearned income for high-income households. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 on March 22, 2010, with the President signing H.R. 3590 into law on March 23. The tax proposals vary in their impact on different income groups. The tax proposals differ in their effects on behavior and where the burden falls in the income distribution. Taxes may be progressive, proportional, or regressive based on income levels. For example, limits on deductions and taxes on high incomes are highly progressive. Health-related tax exclusions affect middle-income brackets proportionally more. Excise taxes tend to be regressive, impacting lower-income classes more heavily. The burden of limiting health-related income and payroll-tax exclusions tends to increase taxes more in middle-income brackets, with smaller effects at the low and high ends of the income distribution. Excise taxes are regressive and fall heavily on lower-income classes. The distributional analysis in this report focuses on the financing mechanism, not the overall effects of health care reform proposals. Despite regressive revenue sources, the proposal may redistribute in favor of lower-income individuals. The report reviews revenue raisers proposed in House and Senate bills and by President Obama, along with other financing proposals. The report reviews revenue raisers proposed in House and Senate bills and by President Obama, including the increased Medicare tax, fee on health insurance providers, \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, and fee on branded drugs. The largest revenue raisers over FY2010-FY2019 include the Medicare tax, fee on health insurance providers, \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, and fee on branded drugs. These health-related provisions account for about 90% of revenues, with shares changing over time due to delays and expirations. In 2019, the Medicare tax is 44% of the total, followed by the Cadillac tax at 22%. In 2019, the largest revenue raisers include the Medicare tax at 44%, the Cadillac tax at 22%, health insurance fees at 14%, drug fees at 3%, and biofuel provision has expired. Other provisions account for 7% of revenues. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue and tax provisions for health care reform in 2009. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue and tax provisions for health care reform in 2009, including a tax on high-income individuals. Legislation such as H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 were passed to fund health care, with modifications to proposals and additional revenue raisers. The House passed H.R. 3962 on November 14, 2009, which included modifications to proposals in H.R. 3200. The main changes involved revising the surtax on high-income taxpayers and adding new revenue raisers. The initial proposal in H.R. 3200 aimed to generate $583.1 billion for health care reform, with $543.9 billion coming from a surtax on individual taxpayers based on adjusted gross income. The surtax rates ranged from 1% to 5.4% for different income brackets, with potential adjustments in 2013 based on health program savings. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 included a surtax on adjusted gross income for high-income taxpayers. The rates ranged from 1% to 5.4% based on income brackets, with potential adjustments in 2013. It also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 included a surtax on adjusted gross income for high-income taxpayers, ranging from 1% to 5.4% based on income brackets. It also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a provision for health savings accounts and itemized deductions for health care, raising $5 billion. Other revenue raisers included a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit ($26.1 billion), a provision to prevent U.S. tax avoidance through treaties ($7.5 billion), and codifying the economic substance doctrine to combat tax sheltering by corporations ($3.6 billion). Additionally, there was a provision to expand the definition of dependents for certain health-related tax purposes, costing $4 billion. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 included a surtax on high-income taxpayers, revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, and provisions for health-related tax purposes. The surtax imposed on incomes over $1 million for joint returns and $500,000 for single taxpayers raised $460.5 billion. Other revenue raisers included measures to prevent U.S. tax avoidance through treaties and codifying the economic substance doctrine to combat tax sheltering by corporations. Additionally, there was a provision to expand the definition of dependents for certain health-related tax purposes. The revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit in H.R. 3200 is projected to raise $6.0 billion. Other provisions in H.R. 3962 include restrictions on health-related tax provisions such as limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, and disallowing deductions for subsidies related to Medicare Part D. These measures are estimated to raise billions of dollars in revenue. H.R. 3962 imposes restrictions on health-related tax provisions, including limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies, and imposing a 2.5% excise tax on medical devices. It also requires information reporting on payments to corporations. These measures are estimated to raise significant revenue. The proposal includes extending reporting requirements for payments to corporations, which would increase tax compliance. It also involves extending certain health benefits for spouses and dependents, imposing fees on health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. Additionally, there is a provision for a tax on the sale of medical devices. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes a tax on the sale of medical devices and other provisions. The original surtax on high-income individuals in H.R. 3962 would target the top 1.2% of taxpayers, making it highly progressive. The surtax would affect 0.3% of taxpayers and has raised concerns about its impact on small businesses. The surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 targets the top 1.2% of taxpayers, affecting 0.3% of taxpayers. Concerns have been raised about its impact on small businesses, with only about 4% of businesses being affected initially. Higher-income individuals would bear a larger share of the surtax burden. The health proposal was not discussed, but it could impact small businesses positively or negatively. The revised surtax would affect 1.2% of unincorporated businesses, with higher-income individuals bearing a larger share of the burden. Income is concentrated at higher levels, with business income more concentrated in higher-income brackets. Labor income makes up three-quarters of overall income, with the rest split between passive capital income. Income is concentrated at higher levels, with labor income accounting for three-quarters of overall income. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels. Individuals with incomes over $1 million contribute 33% of unincorporated business net income, while those with incomes over $500,000 contribute 39%. This concentration is mainly seen in partnership and Subchapter S firms. Returns with adjusted gross income of $1 million or more make up 7.5% of total proprietorship income, and returns with income over $500,000 make up 12.6%. Businesses with positive income and individuals with incomes over $500,000 make up 39% of total income. Partnership and Subchapter S firms account for this concentration, with returns over $1 million contributing 7.5% of proprietorship income and returns over $500,000 contributing 12.6%. For partnerships and Subchapter S firms, returns with income over $1 million make up 49% of net income, and returns with income over $500,000 make up 64% of net income. Taxpayers at the top tax rate are responsible for 61% of business flow-through income. Some income in partnerships and proprietorships may come from passive income and tax shelters. According to a 2007 Treasury study, taxpayers at the top tax rate contribute 61% of business flow-through income, with 64% of net income coming from returns over $500,000 in partnerships and Subchapter S firms. However, a significant portion of this income may be passive or from businesses that are not actively engaged in entrepreneurship. The Treasury study showed that high-income taxpayers contribute 46% of active positive business income, with only 22.8% having business income more than half of total income. This suggests that much of the income is passive investment income, particularly in partnerships, reflecting activities not focused on entrepreneurship or job creation. The Treasury study revealed that high-income taxpayers contribute a significant portion of active positive business income, with only 22.8% having business income exceeding half of their total income. Partnership income, largely from finance, real estate, oil and gas, and services, is often passive investment income not centered on entrepreneurship or job creation. Business income, while somewhat concentrated, includes a substantial amount from passive investments. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers contribute a significant portion of business income, with most coming from securities and investment firms, professional services, and health sectors. However, much of this income is associated with passive investments and professions like lawyers and doctors, which may not be significant sources of job creation for lower-income individuals. Small businesses, while creating more jobs, also experience the highest job loss rates. Therefore, increased tax revenue from small businesses may not be substantial. The argument questions the importance of small businesses as sources of new jobs, highlighting that they create more jobs but also have the highest job loss rates. The evidence on job creation is unclear due to migration across size classifications. Additionally, small businesses offer more opportunities to women and minorities but pay less, are less stable, and have fewer benefits. While a stimulus for job creation may be necessary during economic downturns, a permanent policy is deemed unnecessary as the economy creates jobs over time. The economy creates its own jobs over time, making a permanent policy for job creation unnecessary. Excluding income from certain business operations could mitigate objections to a surcharge. Excluding flow-through income from the top 1% would sacrifice revenue, but limiting exclusions to passive income and certain industries could minimize losses. Excluding income from certain business operations could mitigate objections to a surcharge. Sacrificing revenue by excluding flow-through income from the top 1% could be minimized by limiting exclusions to passive income and certain industries. The curr_chunk discusses various health-related tax provisions, including flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. It also mentions the tax on medical devices as a revenue-raising measure. The tax on medical devices in the House and Senate bills is a revenue-raising measure, with differences in implementation. The House bill imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers, while the Senate proposal includes a fixed fee. The tax rate in the House bill is 2.5% of the value of medical devices, imposed on manufacturers and importers. Costs may be passed on to consumers, insurers, or absorbed by producers, potentially impacting innovation in the long run. The tax in the House bill on medical devices could impact innovation by discouraging investment in new devices. The interest allocation proposal would repeal a provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. This change could increase allowable foreign tax credits for firms with more foreign taxes paid than credits, reducing U.S. tax liability. The 2004 provision in international tax laws allows for foreign tax credits to be increased by allocating more income abroad, reducing U.S. tax liability. It also includes interest on foreign borrowing and debt-financed investment in the calculation, resulting in a higher foreign tax credit limit. Another provision aims to prevent \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. The proposed provisions in international tax laws aim to allocate more domestic interest to domestic income, reduce interest allocated to foreign income, increase the foreign tax credit limit, prevent \"treaty-shopping\" by eliminating benefits for setting up subsidiaries in treaty countries, and codify the economic substance doctrine to disallow tax benefits for arrangements lacking economic substance. The third provision in tax laws aims to codify the economic substance doctrine, requiring transactions to meet both objective and subjective tests to prevent tax avoidance. Penalties are imposed for non-compliance, with supporters arguing for more consistent treatment across courts. The proposals aim to prevent tax avoidance by requiring transactions to meet objective and subjective tests, with penalties for non-compliance. Supporters argue for consistent treatment across courts. H.R. 3962 includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations to aid in tax enforcement on self-employed individuals with noncompliance. Small businesses incorporating may pose compliance challenges. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires reporting of payments to corporations to aid in tax enforcement on self-employed individuals with noncompliance. Small businesses incorporating may face compliance challenges, increasing the burden on businesses. The change simplifies reporting requirements by not distinguishing between corporate and noncorporate status. The provision in H.R. 3962 simplifies reporting requirements by not requiring firms to determine corporate or noncorporate status for tax enforcement. It excludes fuel with water, sediment, or ash content from the cellulosic biofuels producer credit, impacting black liquor eligibility. The original black liquor credit expired in 2009 and was seen as an unintended recipient of a blended fuel credit aimed at reducing fossil fuel use in the paper industry. The black liquor provision, originally eligible for a fuel credit, expired in 2009. It was viewed as unintended for reducing fossil fuel use in the paper industry. Firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 annually. Under current law, firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 annually to increase third party reporting and address missing income. Compliance rates for other types of income are higher, but only a small fraction of firms file this information return. The reporting requirements for payments to unincorporated businesses aim to increase compliance, especially for small businesses. While compliance rates for other types of income are higher, only a small fraction of firms file this information return. The proposed expansion of reporting for services to corporations has been suggested for years to simplify compliance for small firms. The expansion of reporting requirements for payments to unincorporated businesses has been proposed to increase compliance, especially for small firms. Two potential reasons for this expansion are the significant increase in small firms in corporate status and the simplification of compliance for firms unsure of their providers' status. Additionally, expanding reporting to include goods as well as services is a newer idea that could increase the share of firms filing these forms and improve enforcement and compliance for smaller businesses. The proposed expansion of reporting requirements for payments to unincorporated businesses aims to increase compliance, especially for small firms. It would simplify compliance by eliminating the differentiation between goods and services, potentially increasing the number of firms filing these forms. However, businesses criticize the increased cost and administrative burden, questioning the IRS's capacity to utilize the additional information. One option to address concerns is to raise the minimum dollar reporting requirement. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which includes a provision for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain thresholds. This provision was somewhat scaled back in a bill passed by the Senate, raising a total of $398.1 billion in revenue. There are concerns about the proposed expansion of reporting requirements for payments to unincorporated businesses, with critics questioning the IRS's ability to handle the additional information. One option to address these concerns is to raise the minimum reporting requirement. The America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, S. 1796, includes a provision for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain thresholds. The bill raises $398.1 billion in revenue, with the largest provision being a 40% excise tax on health coverage in excess of $8,500 for singles and $23,000 for families. Other revenue raisers include an increase in the payroll tax for high-income earnings and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities. H.R. 3590 included various revenue raisers, such as an increase in the payroll tax for hospital insurance for high-income earnings, a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, and a change in the treatment of Blue Cross. Additionally, the plan included a temporary fee on insured and self-insured plans, liberalized the adoption credit, and excluded assistance for participants in state student loan repayment programs for certain health professionals. The revenue raisers mainly relate to health tax provisions or health issues. The plan includes provisions to raise revenue related to health tax provisions, such as conforming medical expenses definitions for health savings accounts, limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies, raising the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs, and limiting deductions for remuneration to health insurance providers. The proposal in Part D includes raising the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs to 10%, limiting deductions for remuneration to health insurance providers, imposing fees on manufacturers of medical devices, health insurance providers, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities, as well as a fee on insured and self-insured health plans. The proposal includes fees on manufacturers and importers of medical devices, health insurance providers, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities. It also imposes an excise tax on indoor tanning facilities and an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for joint returns. Other provisions include requirements for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on W-2 of health benefits value, and a safe harbor for nondiscrimination rules in cafeteria plans for small employers. The plan includes a Medicare payroll tax increase projected to raise $86.8 billion. Other provisions have negligible costs, such as additional requirements for non-profit hospitals and employer reporting on health benefits value. There are also revenue losing provisions like a therapeutic discovery project credit and an adoption tax credit extension. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to the adoption tax credit, excise tax on health insurance coverage, fees on drugs and medical devices, and the impact on insurance companies and employers. The excise tax rate is comparable to the top income tax rate and may result in higher premiums for individuals. The excise tax rate is similar to the top income tax rate and could lead to higher premiums for individuals. It is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, with thresholds adjusted annually based on CPI plus one percentage point. Plans in high-cost states would have higher thresholds initially. The excise tax is estimated to generate $148.9 billion over 10 years, with thresholds adjusted annually based on CPI plus one percentage point. Thresholds would be higher initially for plans in high-cost states, and also for individuals over 55 and in risky professions. A study indicates that 90% of plans would be unaffected by this provision. The excise tax on high-cost health insurance plans aims to limit benefits for agriculture, forestry, and fishery workers. Thresholds are set at $9,850 for single plans and $26,000 for family plans. 90% of plans would be unaffected by the Senate Finance Committee version of the provision. The tax is meant to discourage rising healthcare costs, with thresholds adjusted annually based on CPI plus one percentage point. The excise tax on high-cost health insurance plans aims to limit benefits and discourage rising healthcare costs. The tax thresholds are set at $9,850 for single plans and $26,000 for family plans, affecting only a small percentage of plans. The tax would be collected at the insurance-company level or could result in reduced health insurance costs and increased wages, raising taxes. This approach may raise fairness issues and potentially impact lower-income employees more than a cap on the exclusion. The excise tax on high-cost health insurance plans aims to limit benefits and discourage rising healthcare costs. It could potentially impact lower-income employees more than a cap on the exclusion. H.R. 3590 would increase the HI payroll tax for high earners, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. H.R. 3590 would increase the HI payroll tax for high earners by 0.9% on earnings over $200,000 for single individuals and $250,000 for joint returns, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. The tax would be collected by employers and the employee would be responsible for any discrepancy in withholding. This provision targets high-income taxpayers and is very progressive, although it does not apply to capital income. Fees on health insurance providers also contribute to revenue, totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010. The provision in H.R. 3590 would raise revenue from high-income taxpayers through increased HI payroll tax and fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices. The fees on health insurance providers would increase over time, while the fees on medical devices would remain constant. The total revenue from fees and excise taxes would amount to $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. The fees for health insurance providers and medical devices increase over time. Health insurance providers pay $2 billion in 2011, $4 billion in 2012, $7 billion in 2013, $9 billion in 2014-2016, and $10 billion thereafter. Medical devices pay $2 billion annually from 2011-2017 and $3 billion annually after. Branded drugs pay $2.1 billion yearly. Fixed nominal aggregate fees become less important over time. Insured and self-insured plans pay smaller fees to fund the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund, expiring after September 31, 2019. These taxes may increase prices, reduce profits, and impact insurance companies and consumers. The fees for health insurance providers, medical devices, and branded drugs increase over time to fund the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund. These taxes could impact prices, reduce profits, and affect insurance companies and consumers. Certain devices are exempt from the medical device fee, and all three provisions for fees collect a fixed amount of revenue based on sales shares. The medical device fee and branded drug fee collect revenue based on sales shares. Certain devices are exempt from the medical device fee, with a sliding scale to reduce the impact on small producers. For drugs, the shares vary based on sales amounts. Insurance premiums are also subject to fees, with the first $25 million exempted. $25 million is counted for drugs, with varying shares based on sales amounts. Insurance premiums are subject to fees, with exemptions for the first $25 million. Third-party administrators also have exclusions based on sales amounts. The fees are not deductible and are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment. The tax at the margin depends on the share of sales produced by individual firms, with H.R. 3590 also imposing a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities. A provision for taxing cosmetic producers was discussed but not included in the final bill. The tax is in the form of a standard excise tax, potentially absorbed by providers, and imposed on the customer. During the debate, a provision for taxing cosmetic producers was discussed but not included in the final bill. The tax is a standard excise tax imposed on the customer, potentially absorbed by providers. Nonprofit hospitals must meet a \"community benefit\" standard to receive tax benefits. The Congressional Budget Office found that nonprofit hospitals provided slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals. Federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals were estimated to be worth about $6 billion in 2002. Hearings were held by the Senate Finance Committee in 2006 and the House Ways and Means Committee in 2005 on the topic of charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. The Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals' charity care, community benefits, governance, and billing practices. IRS released an interim report on nonprofit hospitals in July 2007. The IRS released an interim report in July 2007 on nonprofit hospitals, highlighting concerns about charity care spending and the lack of specific standards for exempt status. Senator Grassley authorized a round-table discussion on the draft addressing charity care, community benefits, governance, and billing practices. The draft proposes codifying rules for nonprofit hospitals to qualify for exempt status based on a community needs standard and minimum charitable patient care. It may not significantly impact revenues but could increase charity care levels. Flexible spending accounts allow for tax reductions to fund program benefits chosen by employees. The draft proposes rules for nonprofit hospitals to qualify for exempt status based on community needs and minimum charity care. Flexible spending accounts allow tax reductions for program benefits chosen by employees, with concerns about the \"use it or lose it\" nature of the plan. Options for raising revenue include limits on contributions or elimination of these plans. The House and Senate bills propose limiting flexible spending accounts to $2,500 and indexing the amounts by the CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication costs are not eligible for tax deductions in excess of the 7.5% floor, affecting health savings accounts, health flexible spending accounts, and health reimbursement accounts. This provision aims to align eligible spending for employer accounts with the itemized deduction rules. The provision in both the House and Senate bills aims to align eligible spending for employer health accounts with itemized deduction rules, disallowing tax-excludible expenditures for over-the-counter medication like aspirin. This provision is targeted at taxpayers with high medical expenses relative to income, estimated to cost $10.7 billion per year and claimed by about 12 million taxpayers. It may be utilized more by those without insurance or for uncovered costs under insurance plans. The medical expense deduction provision is aimed at taxpayers with significant medical costs relative to income, utilized by about 12 million taxpayers. It tends to benefit middle-class taxpayers more than other deductions, with higher-income groups claiming a smaller percentage of the deduction. The medical expense deduction benefits middle-class taxpayers more than higher-income groups, with only 15% of the deduction claimed by those with incomes over $100,000. The Senate bill increases the deduction floor to 10%, except for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. The Senate bill increases the medical expense deduction floor to 10%, except for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. This provision results in a revenue loss of about $1 billion annually. In 1986, tax exemptions for Blue Cross and Blue Shield were removed due to their activities being similar to commercial insurance. The Blues still offer specialized rates, but the tax benefits also benefit shareholders. A proposal in the Senate bill aims to disallow tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. The Obama Administration released a compromise proposal in 2010, which includes modifications to revenue provisions, such as a tax on high-cost health insurance plans. The Obama Administration's compromise proposal in 2010 includes modifications to revenue provisions, such as a tax on high-cost health insurance plans. The proposal delays the effective date of the high-cost plan tax from 2013 to 2018 and raises the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. To offset the revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers. The Obama Administration's compromise proposal in 2010 includes modifications to revenue provisions, such as a tax on high-cost health insurance plans. To offset the revenue lost by changes to H.R. 3590, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers, imposing a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate to 2.35% for married couples earning over $250,000 and individuals earning over $200,000. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment on certain unearned income is proposed for high-income earners. The President's compromise proposal in 2010 includes revenue provisions like clarifying that certain byproducts are not eligible for a biofuel tax credit and codifying the economic substance doctrine. It reduces the tax on high-cost insurance, increasing revenue from the Medicare tax on investment income. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872, with the President expected to sign the bill on March 23. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872, with the President expected to sign the bill on March 23. The additional Medicare tax on high-income taxpayers' investment income increases revenue from $86.8 billion to $210.2 billion. Amounts paid by firms for employee health insurance are excluded from wages and taxes. The benefits of employer-sponsored health insurance include group insurance or self-insurance, deductible contributions through HSAs and FSAs, and exclusion of expenses from taxable income. Options for capping the exclusion have been proposed by the Senate Finance Committee and other commentators. The Finance Committee and other commentators have proposed eliminating the employer exclusion for health insurance benefits, with options including a dollar limit based on a benchmark plan or income, or both. The employer exclusion is the largest health-related income tax benefit, costing billions in revenue loss annually. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated the revenue losses to be growing at an average of about 8% per year. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that capping health benefits would cost $132.7 billion in 2008, with additional revenue losses of $93.5 billion from excluding benefits from the payroll tax. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center projected these amounts to be $144.8 billion and $95.7 billion in 2010, growing at an average of 8% per year. The revenue effect of capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs was estimated at $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and increasing thereafter. This amount represents about 10% of the total revenue lost from the tax exemption related to income and payroll taxes. The revenue from capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs in 2009 and indexing for inflation is estimated to be $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and increasing. This amount represents about 10% of the total revenue lost from the tax exemption related to income and payroll taxes. The Tax Policy Center estimates that a cap based on average health insurance costs in 2009 could raise significant revenue if not indexed, growing at an average rate of 32% to reach $226.5 billion in 2019. Health insurance costs in 2009 could raise significant revenue if not indexed, growing at an average rate of 32% to reach $226.5 billion in 2019. Caps need to be indexed to health price inflation to maintain a relatively even revenue stream. The employer exclusion in health insurance has been criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing the purchase of excessive insurance, leading to increased healthcare costs. Higher-income individuals benefit more from this exclusion due to their higher marginal tax rates. Indexing caps to health price inflation is necessary to ensure a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion in health insurance benefits higher-income individuals more due to their higher marginal tax rates. Payroll taxes are flat rate taxes, with the Social Security portion subject to an income cap. Excluded income in the form of health insurance benefits is not likely to rise with an individual's income because group plans provide the same coverage for everyone in the group. The tax benefit from the current exclusion of health insurance benefits may not rise with income as it is not targeted towards higher-income families. The effects suggest that the tax benefit might not increase as a percentage of income, making the additional burden from repealing the tax benefit not necessarily progressive. The tax effects as a percentage of income are highest in the middle income brackets, indicating a proportional tax benefit across much of the income spectrum. Repealing the tax benefit of health insurance exclusion may not be progressive, with the highest tax effects in the middle income brackets. The change would result in a proportional tax shift across middle-income brackets, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. Average tax increase from repealing the exclusion is not directly tied to the size of health insurance benefits. Repealing the tax benefit of health insurance exclusion may not be progressive, with the highest tax effects in the middle income brackets. The change would result in a proportional tax shift across middle-income brackets, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. Average tax increase from repealing the exclusion is not directly tied to the size of health insurance benefits. The exclusion has been supported to reduce adverse selection in the health care market and employer health insurance covers 62% of the non-elderly population. Imposing a cap on the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance could address the issue of excessive insurance purchasing without significantly affecting coverage. However, determining includable income for tax purposes and potential inequities pose challenges. This cap could help reduce adverse selection in the health care market and maintain employer participation, which covers a significant portion of the non-elderly population. The challenge of imposing a cap on the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance lies in determining includable income for tax purposes, which could lead to inequities and administrative burdens. Individual costs vary based on factors like geographic location, family size, age, and health status, with employer plans involving implicit cost shifting. This can result in the young subsidizing the old and small families subsidizing large ones, affecting premiums for firms purchasing insurance. The inclusion of employer-provided health insurance in taxable income poses challenges due to varying individual costs based on factors like age, family size, and location. Implicit cost shifting in employer plans can lead to inequities, with the young subsidizing the old and small families subsidizing large ones. Variations in premiums for firms purchasing insurance and claims for firms self-insuring are affected by group characteristics. While variations by family coverage are common in proposals, age-based variations may not be as prevalent. The insurance objective of risk sharing considers factors like family size, age, and location. While variations by family coverage are common, age-based variations may result in large income inclusions for older individuals. Imposing income imputations that do not vary with age may discourage younger individuals with lower incomes from participating. Not varying imputed income from health benefits by age may lead to inequities across employees. Imposing income imputations that do not vary with age may discourage younger individuals with lower incomes from participating in benefits. Not varying imputed income from health benefits by age can lead to inequities across employees based on characteristics like gender, age, and health status, as well as variations in premiums due to workforce demographics and firm size. Adjusting for these factors would increase administrative burden. Benefits included in income could potentially follow COBRA benefit rules. Adjustments for characteristics like geographic location, firm size, and workforce health could add to administrative burden. Benefits included in income could follow COBRA benefit rules, with options for reformulation as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers. The Senate Finance Committee options document suggests reformulating the exclusion as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers. An alternative approach could be to restrict deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating deductions for insurance costs above a certain threshold to raise revenues and discourage overly generous health insurance packages. The Senate Finance Committee's report considered various health-related income tax expenditures, including the deduction available to employers for insurance costs above a certain threshold. The second-largest tax expenditure is the exclusion of Medicare benefits from income, estimated at $40.6 billion. Modifying this provision would pose administrative challenges and has not been included in the options. Additionally, the exclusion of medical benefits for military dependents and retirees, totaling $3.3 billion, was also discussed. The report discusses tax expenditures related to health, including the exclusion of Medicare benefits from income, estimated at $40.6 billion. Health savings accounts allow tax-deductible contributions and tax exclusions for medical expenses. Contributions to HSAs have a dollar cap and cost about $0.5 billion per year in foregone taxes. Health savings accounts (HSAs) allow tax-deductible contributions with a dollar cap and tax exclusions for medical expenses. Investment earnings and income spent on medical costs are not taxable. Distributions for other purposes are subject to a 10% additional tax. Foregone taxes due to HSAs cost about $0.5 billion per year and are expected to increase. HSAs help individuals purchase insurance against catastrophic costs but not for routine expenses, reducing the incentive to overspend on healthcare. However, they can lead to adverse selection by attracting healthier individuals out of other insurance pools. The Finance Committee options paper suggests limiting individual contributions under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses. The Finance Committee options paper proposes limiting individual contributions under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). It also suggests that HSA distributions should only be tax-exempt for medical expenses verified by an employer or third party. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding the exemption of students from FICA taxes on certain services, particularly medical residents. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify the exemption of students from FICA taxes, especially medical residents. It would establish a dollar limit for the exception, extend Medicare coverage to all state and local employees, and subject certain employees hired before March 31, 1986, to payroll taxes. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify the exemption of students from FICA taxes, establish a dollar limit for the exception, and extend Medicare coverage to all state and local employees. This provision would increase health insurance payroll taxes that finance Medicare, leading to increased Medicare costs due to expanded coverage. Additionally, the proposal discusses excise tax provisions on alcoholic and sugared beverages, with suggestions for increases in tobacco taxes to finance the state children's health insurance program. The Finance Committee options paper discusses excise tax provisions on alcoholic beverages and sugared beverages. Different tax rates apply to distilled spirits, beer, and wine based on their alcohol content. Tobacco tax increases are not included in the options paper as it was recently raised to fund the state children's health insurance program. Alcohol taxes vary based on the type of beverage and its alcohol content. Distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per gallon, beer at $18 per barrel, and wine by type. The tax on alcohol falls over time due to inflation and has not been revised since 1991. If adjusted for inflation, the tax on distilled spirits would be around $19.60 currently. Alcohol taxes raise similar issues as tobacco taxes, with health costs associated with heavy drinking. The tax on distilled spirits has not been revised since 1991 and would be around $19.60 currently if adjusted for inflation. Alcohol taxes raise similar health cost issues as tobacco taxes, with external costs larger than current taxes. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, tend to be regressive, collecting a larger percentage of low-income individuals' income. Alcohol taxes, similar to tobacco taxes, are regressive and collect a larger percentage of low-income individuals' income. Current distributional data on federal excise taxes is limited, with the latest data from a 1990 study. Expenditures on alcoholic beverages as a percentage of income by quintile are shown in Table 2, indicating that the burden of alcohol taxes is likely more concentrated in lower income classes due to the purchase of more expensive alcohols by higher income classes. The regressivity of alcohol taxes is influenced by the distribution of income and the pricing of alcoholic beverages. Higher income classes tend to buy more expensive alcohols, making the tax burden more concentrated in lower income classes. The unit tax nature of excise taxes makes them more regressive than sales taxes, with alcohol taxes being less regressive than tobacco taxes due to the prevalence of alcohol purchases increasing with income. The unit tax nature of excise taxes makes them more regressive than sales taxes. Alcohol taxes are less regressive than tobacco taxes due to the prevalence of alcohol purchases increasing with income. The proposal would increase taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with current federal alcohol taxes collecting $9.4 billion in revenues. The proposal aims to increase taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits. The tax on beer at 4.5% alcohol level would be $44.64 per barrel, on table wine at 12.5% alcohol level would be $3.88 per gallon. The tax increase would generate about $5.7 billion in revenue annually, with the tax on distilled spirits increasing by 18.5%, wine by 225%, and beer by 148%. The proposal aims to increase taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits. The tax on beer would increase by 148%, wine by 225%, and distilled spirits by 18.5%. This would generate about $5.7 billion in revenue annually. Price elasticity estimates suggest that consumption is not highly responsive to price, with beer at 0.16, wine at 0.58, and spirits at 0.39. The elasticity estimates for beer, wine, and spirits are 0.16, 0.58, and 0.39 respectively. Current alcohol sales total $187.6 billion. Applying these elasticities suggests a decrease in consumption for beer, wine, and spirits. Older estimates were higher, implying larger decreases in consumption. The proposal suggests a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates indicating a potential decrease in consumption. Testimony at the Senate Finance Committee discussed the potential revenue from the tax. Unlike alcohol and tobacco, the health effects of these beverages have not been extensively studied. The tax may be regressive and some question singling out this particular food source for taxation. The proposal suggests a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages to raise $17 billion, with limited studies on health effects. Some question singling out this food source for taxation, as other unhealthy items could also be taxed. Individual taxpayers can choose to take standard or itemized deductions, with medical expenses accounting for less than 6% of total deductions. The largest share of itemized deductions are for mortgage interest (36%) and taxes (35%), with income taxes and property taxes on owner-occupied homes being the most common. Charitable contributions make up about 15% of total deductions. President Obama's tax proposals include capping the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates at 28%. President Obama's tax proposals include capping the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates at 28%, with the provision expected to raise revenues by about $25 billion. The tax increases would primarily affect high-income taxpayers, constituting the top 2% of incomes. The tax proposal aims to cap the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates at 28%, affecting high-income taxpayers with incomes over $250,000. This provision is expected to raise revenues by about $25 billion and primarily targets the top 2% of incomes. The $200,000-to-$500,000 income class accounts for 11.4% of itemized deductions, while the $500,000-and-over income class contributes around one-fifth of itemized deductions, with a significant portion coming from charitable contributions. The tax proposal aims to cap itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers over $250,000 at 28%, affecting around one-fifth of deductions. The $500,000-and-above class contributes significantly to charitable contributions deductions, with studies suggesting a modest 1% reduction in giving due to the limit on tax benefits. Studies suggest a modest 1% reduction in charitable giving due to the cap on itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. The impact varies based on the type of charitable objectives, with larger effects on health, art, and education donations. Excluding charitable deductions from the cap could sacrifice a quarter of expected revenue gain. Other proposals include limiting all itemized deductions to 15%, projected to raise $141 billion in 2011. President Obama proposes base-broadening provisions to increase compliance and finance health care reform, resulting in about $1 billion of revenue gain. Other commentators suggest significant restrictions on itemized deductions, with options like limiting all deductions to 15% to raise $141 billion in 2011. Additionally, there are narrow revisions affecting financial institutions and insurance companies. The tax provisions proposed by President Obama aim to increase compliance and revenue gain, resulting in about $1 billion. The second set of provisions includes revisions affecting financial institutions, tax accounting methods, and estate tax, raising around $5 billion to $6 billion per year. The largest revenue loss comes from restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of a certain inventory valuation method. The largest provisions in revenue loss over the 10-year budget window include restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets for estate tax purposes, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of a certain inventory valuation method. Other income tax provisions could potentially generate additional revenues through rate increases, widening rate brackets, expanding the base, or increasing tax rates on favored income items like dividends and capital gains. Burman suggests reducing the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% instead of CPI. Burman suggests reducing the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% instead of CPI, estimating to raise $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019. Other suggestions include increasing the capital gains tax, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reforming international tax enforcement, and repealing LIFO inventories. The Treasury's \"Greenbook\" contains revenue estimates for various tax proposals, including raising tax rates on capital gains and dividends, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reforming international tax enforcement, and repealing LIFO inventories. These measures could raise significant revenue, with international provisions alone raising over $20 billion. Additionally, increasing payroll taxes could also provide a source of revenue. The revenue raised from international reforms in the President's proposal could exceed $20 billion. Increasing payroll taxes, eliminating the Social Security earnings cap, and implementing a new revenue source like a value-added tax or carbon tax could generate significant additional revenue. Burman estimates that various tax measures could raise over $700 billion in total. One option for raising revenue is to implement a 10% value added tax (VAT) proposed by Burman, which could generate $600 billion. Another possibility is a carbon tax or auction revenue from a cap and trade system. However, these new revenue sources come with administrative challenges and may not be worth the costs if very large revenue sources are not desired. Additionally, implementing these taxes would involve transition and program issues, and they would also be regressive like excise taxes. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system may not be worth the costs due to administrative challenges and potential regressive effects. Transition and program issues would also need to be addressed. Table A-1 compares revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590 with those enacted into law in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
