    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. UNICEF reported a 60% decrease in under-five mortality since 1960, but daily deaths among children under five remain high. Ann Veneman celebrated the 60% decline in annual deaths among children under five since 1960. Despite this progress, 26,000 children still die each day, with most deaths occurring in developing countries, particularly in Africa. Neonatal infections and five infectious diseases are responsible for nearly 90% of child deaths, with undernutrition being a significant underlying cause. The majority of child deaths occur in developing countries, with almost half in Africa. Neonatal infections and five infectious diseases account for nearly 90% of all child deaths. Undernutrition is a significant underlying cause. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions. Millennium Development Goals aim for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Progress in other MDGs affects the ability to reach these goals. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aim for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Progress in other MDGs, such as access to clean water and undernutrition, affects the ability to reach these goals. UNICEF found that 62 countries were making no progress towards the MDG on child survival, with nearly 75% in Africa. Child survival and maternal health are inextricably linked. Children in poverty are more vulnerable to infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. UNICEF reports that 62 countries, mostly in Africa, are not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival. Maternal health is closely tied to child survival, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Access to adequate diets, safe water, and sanitation could prevent most of these deaths in developing countries. Maternal mortality rates are significantly higher in developing countries compared to industrialized nations. The United Nations FAO states that most of these deaths could be prevented with access to adequate diets, safe water, literacy, and health services during pregnancy. UNICEF estimates that 20% of maternal deaths are linked to undernutrition and 75% are due to obstetric complications. Young mothers under 20 are at higher risk for complications such as toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, and prolonged labor. Complications during pregnancy and childbirth, such as hemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disorders, and unsafe abortions, contribute to higher maternal mortality rates. Young mothers under 20 are at a greater risk for pregnancy-related complications, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates for both mothers and babies. Adolescents aged 15-19 are more likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties, with those under 15 at even higher risk. Girls aged 15-19 have a maternal mortality rate of 178 per 100,000 in some regions. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year. Girls aged 15-19 are at higher risk of maternal mortality, with those under 15 at even greater risk. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, while regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In Africa and Asia, hemorrhage accounts for a significant percentage of maternal deaths, while in industrialized nations and Latin America, it is also a leading cause. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest proportion of skilled birth attendants, with one in every 22 women at risk of pregnancy-related death. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, especially in priority countries accounting for 97% of maternal and child deaths. In industrialized nations, one in every 8,000 women faces the risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, especially in priority countries accounting for 97% of maternal and child deaths. Health workforce shortages in key countries hinder the improvement of health conditions and reaching health-related MDGs. Access to skilled health workers, clean water, mosquito control, and nutritious food are crucial for child and maternal survival rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, child and maternal survival rates are higher in areas with sufficient health workers, clean water, mosquito control, and nutritious food. The region faces the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers globally, with 36 out of 57 countries in Africa experiencing critical shortages. WHO estimates a need for an additional 4.3 million health workers worldwide, with African countries needing to increase their health workforce by about 140% to meet the minimum standard. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has committed over $6 billion in support of global child survival efforts, with $3.4 billion allocated from FY2001-FY2008. Research supported by USAID in the 1970s and 1980s has led to interventions saving millions of children. USAID has committed over $6 billion to global child survival efforts, with $3.4 billion allocated from FY2001-FY2008. The organization focuses on addressing six main health issues that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization states that most of the nearly 10 million children who die each year could be saved. USAID allocates a significant proportion of its child survival funds to address health issues, with a focus on improving child and maternal health. Studies show that malnutrition significantly increases the risk of death in children under five, with malnourished children being more susceptible to infectious diseases. Children who are underweight face a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, with malnourished children being more vulnerable to illnesses like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation, fortification, and infant and young child feeding. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, adding vital immune-building micronutrients to processed foods. Research on biofortified crops is also funded to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods. These programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation to improve child survival and cognitive development. USAID's nutrition programs aim to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods like maize, beans, and sweet potatoes. These programs are integrated with interventions such as safe water and sanitation. USAID emphasizes the importance of proper feeding practices during the first two years of life, highlighting the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding. USAID supports breastfeeding for the first six months of life to prevent childhood diseases and improve infant health. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. USAID also integrates safe infant feeding practices in HIV/AIDS-affected communities. They allocate $30 million annually for nutrition programs, including Vitamin A and food fortification. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices in HIV/AIDS-affected communities to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. They spend $30 million annually on nutrition programs, including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of minimizing indoor pollution, exclusive breastfeeding, adequate nourishment, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. Children should receive full immunizations against infections that cause pneumonia, such as Hib, and vaccines protecting against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Since the mid-1990s, international health organizations have focused on expanding access to vaccines to protect children against pneumonia. USAID has supported the administration of immunizations to nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia since 2002. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, developed by UNICEF and WHO with USAID support, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. Approximately 40% of the world's population, mainly in developing countries, benefit from the expanded IMCI strategy. In the mid-1990s, UNICEF and WHO developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) with USAID support, integrating interventions for various childhood illnesses. USAID has expanded the IMCI strategy, focusing on malaria eradication efforts. Approximately 40% of the world's population, mainly in developing countries, are at risk of malaria, with over 500 million people becoming severely ill each year. Sub-Saharan Africa sees the highest number of cases and deaths, especially among children under five. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed in 2005 to combat this deadly disease. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed in 2005 to combat malaria, a deadly disease affecting parts of Europe, the Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa. USAID coordinates PMI activities with the goal of reducing malaria deaths by 50% in targeted countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with CDC of HHS. PMI reached over 25 million people within two years, including indoor residual spraying, distributing LLITNs, malarial treatments, and training health workers. The PMI program reached over 17 million people by distributing LLITNs, ITNs, and malarial treatments, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, with successful interventions reducing mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. The risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission can be reduced to 2% with successful interventions. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose, is commonly used. Early diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy for children are crucial as HIV progresses faster in them. The cost of ART for children is significantly higher than for adults, estimated at around $260 per child annually. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is higher than for adults, with a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen costing $2,000 per child. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, charging about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill have proven most effective but are more expensive for children. In 2005, the Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART), costing about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Additionally, Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children who need the drug are receiving it. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by about 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions since 1986. PEPFAR implementing agencies have provided care and support to 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, reaching 332,000 OVC through food and nutrition programs. PEPFAR advancements have provided over $289.2 million to initiatives supporting 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. Food and nutrition programs have reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely malnourished individuals on ART. Child-focus programs offer training, promote technology use, support income-generating activities, and connect families to essential health care. Support for HIV-infected adults receiving treatment also benefits children in providing a nurturing environment. The Administration supports people living with HIV/AIDS by providing treatment, care, and support services, benefiting children through a nurturing environment. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, with $191.5 million dedicated to pediatric treatment. PMTCT services have prevented 157,000 infant HIV infections. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for child diarrhea treatment, supporting nearly 5 billion cases with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS). Their programs include training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and expanding community capacity for ORS administration. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs focus on hygiene, with handwashing with soap being emphasized to decrease diarrhea prevalence among children. However, handwashing with soap is not common in poorer communities, with soap often reserved for bathing or washing clothes and dishes. Studies show low rates of soap usage for handwashing in certain areas supported by USAID. In poorer communities, handwashing with soap is not common, with soap usually reserved for bathing or washing clothes and dishes. Studies in Burkina Faso and Lucknow show low rates of soap usage for handwashing. USAID supports partnerships promoting handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence. WHO emphasizes measles immunization as a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths. The measles vaccine is a cost-effective public health intervention, costing less than $1 per dose and saving more lives per unit cost than any other health intervention. In some countries, the measles vaccine is combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines as a bundled dose, costing about $0.65 for measles-rubella (MR) and $1.04 to $1.50 for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) if bought through UNICEF. In countries with significant public health concerns for rubella and mumps, the measles vaccine is often combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines as a single dose. The cost of a MR vaccine is approximately $0.65 per dose, while MMR costs between $1.04 to $1.50 per dose if purchased through UNICEF. Global measles vaccination coverage rates have improved, with an estimated 80% of children vaccinated in 2006, up from 72% in 2000. Accelerated immunization activities have led to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality between 2000 and 2006. Between 2000 and 2006, approximately 478 million children aged nine months to 14 years received measles vaccinations in 46 out of 47 priority countries, leading to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. USAID supports immunization programs globally, partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen healthcare systems. USAID-supported immunization programs in over 100 countries train health workers, improve service delivery, and partner with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Maternal health programs focus on interventions such as nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, tetanus toxoid immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. USAID advocates for skilled birth attendance and community contingency planning for all births. USAID supports maternal health programs with interventions like nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, tetanus toxoid immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. They advocate for skilled birth attendance and community contingency planning for all births, training birth attendants to prevent infant deaths and promoting immediate breastfeeding. Community-based interventions include teaching families to recognize birth complications and arranging transportation to a hospital in advance. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by advocating for skilled birth attendance, community contingency planning, and low-cost interventions to prevent postpartum hemorrhage deaths. They urge communities to ensure mothers give birth in the presence of a trained health care practitioner to administer life-saving techniques. Low-cost interventions can prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage deaths. USAID-supported programs train birth attendants to actively manage the third stage of labor, which includes controlled traction of the umbilical cord, uterine massage, and the use of oxytocin\u2014a drug that slows the flow of blood. Sepsis or other infections cause nearly 10% of all maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, with unhygienic delivery practices identified as a key cause. USAID supports efforts to prevent sepsis by distributing delivery kits, ensuring trained delivery attendants are present at each birth, and training birth attendants to identify signs of infection and use antibiotics when necessary. USAID supports efforts to prevent sepsis by distributing delivery kits, ensuring trained delivery attendants are present at each birth, and training birth attendants to identify signs of infection and use antibiotics when necessary. Additionally, USAID trains health care providers to recognize and treat hypertensive disorders, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia to reduce maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In cases of prolonged or obstructed labor, USAID provides support for mothers experiencing difficulties during childbirth. Obstetric complications like high blood pressure, proteinuria, and eclampsia can lead to prolonged or obstructed labor, risking the lives of both mother and baby. Obstetric fistula, common in low-resource settings, is more prevalent in undernourished young girls due to their underdeveloped pelvic regions. Prevention includes delaying pregnancy. In low-resource settings, obstetric fistula is more common among undernourished young girls with underdeveloped pelvic regions. Delaying pregnancy until the pelvic region is fully developed, providing access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgery when necessary can prevent obstetric fistula. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively, integrating them with other maternal health programs to address the major causes of maternal death and disability. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005. These programs aim to increase access to emergency obstetrical care, postpone child marriage and sexual debut, train families and health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reduce stigma about obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions account for 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations such as 12% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 4% in Africa. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, have seen significant growth. Support for USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, increased by about 28%. The majority of this growth came from higher appropriations for HIV/AIDS and OID, with funds directed towards tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria with increased appropriations for U.S. contributions. This led to discussions about USAID's health programs focusing on global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. The Administration received support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria with increased appropriations for U.S. contributions. Some Members questioned the focus on HIV/AIDS over other global health interventions, urging better integration of HIV/AIDS with TB and nutrition programs. Congress provided significant funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 through FY2008, totaling $19.7 billion. In comparison, USAID's child survival, maternal health, and family planning initiatives received $4.6 billion during the same period. Congress has consistently increased appropriations for global health programs, mainly focusing on specific diseases. During the same time period, Congress allocated $4.6 billion to USAID's child survival and maternal health, vulnerable children, and family planning and reproductive health initiatives. This funding was part of the overall increase in appropriations for global health programs, with a focus on specific diseases such as HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The increase in U.S. commitment to global health programs like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria has raised concerns that other life-saving interventions for women and children, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are being overlooked and underfunded. The World Health Organization states that two-thirds of child deaths are preventable through low-cost interventions, emphasizing the need for increased funding for child survival and maternal health programs. Some argue for increased funding for child survival and maternal health programs beyond HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Suggestions include supporting voluntary family planning to improve maternal and child health by reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and stabilizing population growth. Family planning activities, supported by some for maternal and child health, aim to protect women's health by reducing high-risk pregnancies and children's health by spacing pregnancies. It also helps prevent HIV/AIDS, reduce abortions, and stabilize population growth. However, there are concerns about abortions and coercive practices in some countries. Research shows that family planning can improve morbidity and mortality rates for adolescent girls, especially in rural areas where early marriage and teen pregnancies are common. In rural areas of developing countries, adolescent girls face higher risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Girls under 20 are more likely to have low-birthweight babies and experience complications like toxemia, anemia, and obstetric fistula. Those aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties, with those under 15 being five times as likely. Delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and timely caesarean surgery can prevent obstetric fistula, which affects a significant percentage of adolescents in countries like Kenya. Repairing obstetric fistula costs around $300, a prohibitive expense for many young girls and women. In Kenya, 45% of all fistula cases are among adolescents. Obstetric fistula can be prevented by delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and performing caesarean surgery when needed. Repairing fistula costs around $300, a prohibitive expense for many young girls and women. Advocates suggest increasing spending on health systems to reduce maternal and child mortality by improving access to various health strategies and services. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of health systems and donor support in delivering essential interventions like vaccinations to reduce mortality. Strengthening health systems through better coordination with other donors and health ministries can improve efficiency and overall health outcomes. WHO's International Health Partnership is a model for international collaboration in healthcare. Supporters urge Congress to direct USAID to coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries to improve efficiency and outcomes. WHO's International Health Partnership promotes collaboration for better health and development outcomes in developing countries through compacts with donors and governments. The compact is a contract between the international community and recipient countries to support a national health plan with predictable financing. It binds donors and governments to one health plan, budget, and performance benchmarks. Critics highlight the importance of political will in health spending by developing countries. Global health experts emphasize the role of recipient governments in improving health systems. Critics argue that political will influences minimal health spending in developing countries. Lack of political will is cited as a significant reason for unspent health funds. African countries with severe health worker shortages spend an average of $33 per person on health annually, while the U.S. government spends $2,548 per capita. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the continent currently accounting for less than 1% of global health expenditure. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the continent currently accounting for less than 1% of global health expenditure. In April 2001, Members of the African Union (AU) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) signed the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Other Infectious Diseases, pledging to spend at least 15% of their national budgets on health care. By 2004, 33% of AU States had allocated 10% or more of their national budgets to the health sector. According to the Progress Report on the Implementation of the Plans of Action of the Abuja Declarations, 33% of AU States allocated 10% or more of their national budgets to health care by 2004. Only Botswana reported spending at least 15% on health. Some argue that structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices have limited African governments' abilities to increase investments in public health and health worker education. Opponents argue that structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices have hindered African governments' ability to invest in public health and health worker education, leading to shrunken health budgets and a decline in education quality for medical students. This has resulted in shortages of health supplies, medicine, and vaccines, as well as a brain drain of African health workers. The International Development Research Center cautions against biased terminology in discussions about the impact of these practices on public health infrastructures. The Development Research Center cautions against biased terminology in discussions about the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures. Results of these practices were mixed, and the organization does not support extreme views on the erosion of public expenditure on health. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 which increased support by $5 million for FY2008. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 which increased support by $5 million for FY2008. Additionally, H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorized significant funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with a focus on providing maternal and child services. The House version of the bill passed with a vote of 308-116, emphasizing linkages to NGOs for HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs. The Senate version, passed by voice vote 80-16, included a substitute amendment for comprehensive strategies to reduce global poverty. The House and Senate passed bills related to global poverty and child survival in 2007. The bills aim to reduce global poverty, eliminate extreme poverty, and improve maternal and child health. The House version passed by voice vote and was referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate version included a substitute amendment for comprehensive strategies to reduce global poverty. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to address global poverty and child survival. The bills aim to improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. The House version was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, while the Senate version was placed on the Senate legislative calendar. Another bill focused on improving voluntary family planning programs in developing countries. H.R. 1225, Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007, amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries. H.R. 2114, Repairing Young Women's Lives Around the World Act, provides a U.S. voluntary contribution to the United Nations Population Fund for the prevention, treatment, and repair of obstetric fistula. H.R. 2604, United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act, provides support to the United Nations Population Fund for activities to save women's lives and promote universal access to family planning in developing countries. The Women's Health and Dignity Act provides support to the United Nations Population Fund for activities to save women's lives, limit abortion, promote family planning, and assist people in developing countries. S. 1998 focuses on reducing child marriage, while S. 2682 directs funding to the United Nations Population Fund for maternal and child health. The United Nations Population Fund Restoration Act of 2008 (S. 2682) directs U.S. funding for maternal and child health purposes. H.Res. 1045, the Global Security Priorities Resolution, calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation, with estimated savings to be directed towards child survival, hunger, and universal education.
