    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments, leading to legal tools for recovery and habitat protection. Prohibitions on unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and consultation requirements with FWS or NMFS help ensure species' continued existence. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species of animals and plants were listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States. The ESA was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects 2,266 species, with 1,593 in the US. 1,156 US species have recovery plans. The ESA was enacted in 1973 and has been amended several times. Funding authorization expired in 1992, but prohibitions and penalties remain. The ESA aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. It can spark debates over resource allocation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species, regardless of appropriations. It can spark debates over resource allocation due to economic interests and resource scarcities. Declining species are often indicators of altered ecosystems and resource controversies. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species, sparking debates over resource allocation and economic interests. Declining species are often indicators of altered ecosystems and resource controversies, such as the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest. The worldwide debate over global climate change has found an avatar in the polar bear, increasing tensions over the ESA as species are added to the protected list. The debate over global climate change has focused on the polar bear as a symbol. Tensions over the Endangered Species Act (ESA) have increased as species are added to the protected list. Critics argue that the ESA does not do enough to accommodate other needs besides species conservation, while defenders believe it balances development biases in other laws and policies. Debate on the ESA largely divides along demographic lines, with stronger support for species conservation in urban areas. The debate over the Endangered Species Act (ESA) centers on whether it adequately addresses needs beyond species conservation. Support for species conservation varies among demographic groups, with stronger support in urban and suburban areas. Native Americans, often reliant on natural resources, tend to support the survival of listed species. Opposing groups argue that stringent conservation measures will lead to job losses, while proponents claim the opposite. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) debate involves Native Americans, who often support listed species survival due to their reliance on natural resources. Opposing groups argue conservation measures will lead to job losses, while proponents claim the opposite. The debate also involves ethical and religious considerations, with industries like logging and land development viewing the ESA as a problem, while others like commercial fishing see it as supporting their interests. The ESA provides statutory authority for actions but requires authorization of appropriations within the statute. Industries view the ESA as a problem, while others see it as supporting their interests. The ESA contains statutory authority for activities and a provision for appropriations. Questions arise about the act's effectiveness, House and Senate rules for appropriations, and the impact of not funding agencies like FWS and NMFS. The ESA's funding and authorization for appropriations expired in FY1992, leading to questions about the act's prohibitions and authorities. Despite the lack of current authorization, agencies like FWS and NMFS still have the authority to carry out actions and enforce prohibitions under the ESA. The expiration of the provision for appropriations does not negate the law's statutory provisions. Despite the expiration of funding and authorization for appropriations under the ESA in FY1992, agencies like FWS and NMFS still have the authority to enforce prohibitions and carry out actions under the act. The statutory provisions of the ESA remain in effect, and citizens can still initiate civil suits for violations of the act regardless of agency funding. The ESA provisions remain in effect, allowing citizens to initiate civil suits for violations regardless of agency funding. Citizen suits could deter parties from carrying out prohibited acts, even if FWS or NMFS lack funds for enforcement. Congressional rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a measure's statutory force. The House and Senate have rules that distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, but these rules do not affect a measure's statutory force. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports, enforced through points of order on the floor. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules against unauthorized appropriations for floor amendments and conference reports. Senate rules also govern appropriations measures. The House and Senate rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. Special rules can waive points of order against unauthorized appropriations for floor amendments and conference reports. Waivers must be adopted before consideration of the measure or conference report. The prohibition on unauthorized appropriations does not apply to conference reports, and its enforcement can be waived by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a funding lapse would have mixed impacts on supporters and critics of existing law. The prohibition on unauthorized appropriations does not apply to conference reports and can be waived by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a funding lapse would have mixed impacts on supporters and critics of existing law, affecting areas such as interagency consultations, species listings, critical habitat designations, and agency actions. No critical habitat designated, potentially increasing lawsuits when Services fail to meet deadlines (see \" Critical Habitat \"); No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. No fulfillment of obligations under CITES; no monitoring of candidate species; no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat; no acquisition of habitat for listed species; no state grants for conservation; no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions. Last major effort to end funding for ESA in 104th Congress focused on eliminating conflicts in projects. The last major effort to end all funding for the ESA occurred in the 104th Congress, with a focus on eliminating conflicts in projects. Despite some temporary halts in funding for listing new species, the ESA's goal of species recovery has seen limited success, with only 34 species delisted due to recovery as of July 25, 2016. The ESA aims for species recovery to the point where protection is no longer needed. Only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, with some becoming extinct or delisted for various reasons like scientific reclassification or improved data. Proving extinction for rare species like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew can be challenging. The Endangered Species Act aims for species recovery to the point where protection is no longer needed. Rare species like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew are difficult to prove as extinct. The effectiveness of the ESA could be measured by the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations. The Endangered Species Act aims for species recovery to the point where protection is no longer needed. Most species listed are very depleted, with a median population of about 400 animals for endangered vertebrates. 41% of listed species have improved or stabilized their population levels. Some species like red wolves and California condors might not exist without ESA protection. The Endangered Species Act has been successful in protecting species like red wolves and California condors from extinction. Scientific information is crucial for ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction and comparing current extinction rates to background levels. Without the ESA, some species might have declined further to extinction. The scientific background of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) focuses on causes of extinction, comparing current rates to background levels. Habitat loss is a significant risk factor for species, alongside over-exploitation. Global climate change also poses a threat to biodiversity. The decline of species is attributed to removal from the wild, habitat loss, global climate change, and introduction of nonnative invasive species. Nonnative species can act as disease vectors, predators, or competitors, leading to the homogenization of the world's flora and fauna. Nonnative species can be disease vectors, predators, or competitors, leading to the homogenization of the world's flora and fauna. The current rate of extinction exceeds background extinction rates over time, raising concerns among scientists. Geological evidence shows that most species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct, with concerns that the current rate of extinction exceeds background rates. Estimating current extinction rates is challenging due to uncertainty in total species numbers, ranging from 3.5 million to 100 million. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates, with a typical estimate being 17,000 species per year. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates, with a typical estimate being 17,000 species per year. Current rates of extinction are believed to exceed background rates, which are thought to be from 1 to 10 species for every 10 million species per year. Current extinction rates are estimated to be significantly higher than background rates, which are typically 1 to 10 species for every 10 million species per year. Critics question these estimates due to uncertainties in calculations, but biologists argue that similar numbers are found across different studies and methods. Some critics question the estimates of current extinction rates due to uncertainties in calculations, but biologists argue that similar numbers are found across different studies and methods. Evolution continues, so new species may evolve that are better adapted to new conditions. Recovery after major extinction episodes in the geologic record may take some time. Some scientists estimate that recovery to equal numbers of different species after major extinction events could take up to 25 million years. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered. The ESA does not rely on a numerical standard but protects all species and subspecies of animals, including distinct population segments within a species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects all species and subspecies of animals, including distinct population segments within a species. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. Limited protection is available for plant species, and there is no protection for organisms not classified as animals or plants. Controversy exists over whether habitat modification is included in the prohibition on taking. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects all species and subspecies of animals, including distinct population segments within a species. The term \"take\" under the ESA means actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. Controversy surrounds whether habitat modification is included in the prohibition on taking, with a 1995 Supreme Court decision supporting significant habitat modification that harms wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects all species and subspecies of animals, including distinct population segments within a species. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. Species may be listed on the initiative of the appropriate Secretary or by petition from an individual, group, or state agency, based on the best available scientific and commercial information. Economic effects are not considered during the listing process. The Secretary must decide whether to list a species based on scientific information, without considering economic effects. Listing is determined by the species' decline and threats to survival, with endangered species facing extinction. The listing process involves determining if a species is endangered or threatened based on the severity of its decline and threats to survival. Endangered species are at risk of extinction, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA allows for different levels of protection for species, subspecies, or distinct population segments. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" varies, with the DOI previously defining it narrowly. The Department of the Interior (DOI) previously interpreted the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range\" narrowly, but this was found to violate the ESA by multiple courts. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if the species is not currently endangered or threatened throughout its entire range. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if it is crucial for the species' viability, even if the species is not currently endangered throughout its entire range. The determination of a species' endangered or threatened status must consider scientific factors and threats to its continuance. The interpretation states that a species' range is where it currently exists, not where it once existed. Listing a species as endangered or threatened is based on scientific factors and threats, determined solely by the best available data. The decision is likened to diagnosing a disease, where economic impacts are not considered initially. The decision to list a species as endangered or threatened is based solely on scientific factors and threats, without considering economic impacts initially. The addition of the word \"solely\" in the legislation aims to ensure that listing decisions are made based only on biological criteria. The legislation requires the Secretary to base listing decisions solely on scientific and commercial data, removing non-biological factors. Economic considerations are deemed irrelevant to species status determinations. The only options for species listing are endangered, threatened, or not listed. Applying economic criteria to this process is rejected. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that listing decisions must be based solely on scientific data, excluding economic factors. The options for species listing are endangered, threatened, or not listed. While economic criteria are not considered in determining species status, conservation methods can be chosen to minimize costs to society, industry, or landowners while still achieving conservation goals. Petitions often initiate species listings, including changes in status or delisting. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires listing decisions based on scientific data, not economic factors. Conservation methods can lower costs while achieving goals. Petitions often initiate species listings, status changes, or delisting. Agencies must respond within 90 days to petitions, conducting a status review within 12 months if warranted. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to respond to petitions within 90 days, conducting a status review within 12 months if warranted. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines, with settlements in 2011 setting listing determination deadlines for hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with more than 100 for listing. The Endangered Species Act mandates agencies to respond to petitions within 90 days and conduct a status review within 12 months if necessary. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines, with settlements in 2011 setting listing determination deadlines for hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with more than 100 for listing. The question of federal responsibilities towards proposed but unlisted species may arise, impacting management decisions during the listing process. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to respond to petitions within 90 days and conduct a status review within 12 months if necessary. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines, with settlements in 2011 setting listing determination deadlines for hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with more than 100 for listing. The question of federal responsibilities towards proposed but unlisted species may impact management decisions during the listing process. Federal agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary on any action likely to harm proposed species or critical habitat. The conference process for proposed species is distinct from the consultation process for listed species, aiming to resolve conflicts early in the planning process. The conference process for proposed species is less formal than the consultation process for listed species. It allows FWS or NMFS to advise agencies on minimizing adverse effects. Agencies may choose a more formal process to avoid duplication of effort later. The ESA does not limit irreversible resource commitments at the conference stage. Once a species is listed, agencies have specific responsibilities to avoid harm and liability. The Endangered Species Act does not require irreversible commitment of resources by agencies at the proposed listing stage. Agencies have responsibilities to avoid harm to species and liability for compensation. Candidate species are monitored to prevent significant risks to their well-being. The Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. Candidate species are those being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and landowners can enter into conservation agreements to improve the species' status and avoid listing proposals. Under a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA), nonfederal landowners can agree to take actions to improve species conservation with the assurance that no changes will be required if the species is listed as threatened or endangered. When a species is proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Secretary must follow specific procedures including publishing the proposal in the Federal Register, notifying state agencies and counties, inviting comments, notifying foreign countries, and publishing a local summary of the regulation. The process for listing a species under the Endangered Species Act involves publishing a proposal in the Federal Register, notifying relevant parties, holding a public hearing, and monitoring the status of the species. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species, and emergency listings can be made if necessary. The Secretary must monitor candidate species for any emergencies that could jeopardize their existence and promptly list them if necessary. Special regulations can be implemented for threatened species, tailoring protections and recovery measures to specific situations. A federal regulation ensures that threatened species without special rules receive the same protections as endangered species. The ESA allows for the designation of distinct population segments for listed species. The Endangered Species Act allows for the designation of distinct population segments (DPS) for listed species, which are portions of a species separated by genetic distinction and range. A DPS must meet criteria for discreteness and significance, with protection status determined based on the same criteria as other listings. Only vertebrates can be designated as a DPS. The Endangered Species Act allows for the designation of distinct population segments (DPS) based on genetic distinction and range. A DPS must be discrete and significant, with protection status determined using the same criteria as other listings. The gray wolf DPS designation has led to litigation, with courts vacating DPS designations since 2003. NMFS developed evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. ESUs typically include multiple populations. The Endangered Species Act allows for the designation of distinct population segments (DPS) based on genetic distinction and range. NMFS developed evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. ESUs generally include multiple populations and are used to identify important groups of salmon populations. As of July 25, 2016, 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout along the Pacific coast were listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. The ESU concept has been criticized for not being scientifically based, as it was invented by NMFS. The ESU concept was created by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. It was chosen for policy and scientific reasons due to the impracticality of using stock level or full species level. Congress added experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 for species reintroduction with specific criteria to be met. In 1982, Congress added experimental populations to the ESA for species reintroduction with specific criteria to be met. To qualify, the population must be authorized for release and geographically separate from other animals of the same species. An experimental population's protected status is determined based on its risk of extinction, with essential populations being treated differently from nonessential ones under the ESA. Experimental populations under the ESA are classified as essential or nonessential based on their risk of extinction. Essential populations are treated differently and are considered threatened if not in imminent danger of extinction. Special regulations apply, including rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is required for agency actions unless the population is in a national wildlife refuge or park. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential populations. Delisting, uplisting, and downlisting processes are the same as listing. The process for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants is the same as listing. The Secretary of the Interior may initiate a change in the status of listed species based on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic impacts. The Secretary reviews a species' status for any change in listing status based on scientific and commercial data. The determination must be made without considering economic impacts. Critical habitat includes areas essential for conservation, both within and outside the species' geographic area. Designation of critical habitat is required when a species is listed. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species, including areas outside the species' geographic range if deemed essential for conservation. Critical habitat had been designated for 47.5% of listed domestic animal and plant species as of July 25, 2016. Any area, regardless of ownership, can be designated as critical habitat. Critical habitat is to be designated for listed species, with 47.5% already designated as of July 25, 2016. Any area, regardless of ownership, can be designated as critical habitat, affecting private land only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid adverse modification of critical habitat. The designation must be based on scientific data and consider economic and other impacts. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat. The Secretary must designate critical habitat based on scientific data and consider economic impacts. Areas may be excluded if benefits outweigh inclusion, unless extinction risk is present. Economic factors are not considered in listing species as endangered, but are in critical habitat designation. The failure to designate critical habitat may lead to species extinction. Economic factors must be considered in critical habitat designation, even though they are not part of listing species as endangered. Private land use restrictions primarily stem from the prohibition on taking listed species, not just from critical habitat designation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) primarily restricts private land use through the prohibition on taking listed species, not critical habitat designation. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exempt Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation. The Endangered Species Act exempts Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation to avoid interference with military activities. This provision considers national security and aims to prevent designated critical habitat from impacting military training and readiness. Administrations and Congress have supported restrictions on critical habitat designation under the ESA for over 20 years. The Endangered Species Act exempts Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation to avoid interference with military activities. Administrations and Congress have supported restrictions on critical habitat designation under the ESA for over 20 years. FWS placed designation of critical habitat at the lowest priority in its listing budget due to budget constraints, causing concern among conservation groups. FWS has prioritized critical habitat designation low in its budget due to funding constraints, leading to frequent lawsuits for failure to designate. The agency argues that critical habitat offers minimal additional protection for species, making it a poor use of scarce resources. The agency prioritizes critical habitat designation low in its budget due to funding constraints, leading to frequent lawsuits for failure to designate. Critical habitat offers minimal additional protection for species, making it a poor use of scarce resources. Designated critical habitat may not provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions, as the jeopardy consideration already offers necessary protection. The FWS previously argued that destroying or adversely modifying critical habitat without putting the species in jeopardy would be rare. This conclusion was based on the regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify,\" which requires a significant decrease in the habitat's value for the species' survival and recovery. The FWS argued that designated critical habitat does not offer extra protection in federal actions as the jeopardy consideration already provides necessary protection. This was based on the regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify,\" which required a significant decrease in habitat value for species' survival and recovery. Several federal courts of appeal agreed that the definition shifted focus from species recovery to survival, leading to a change in February 2016. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" in critical habitat was changed in February 2016 to focus on species recovery, following a Ninth Circuit decision. The new definition emphasizes alterations that diminish the value of critical habitat for conservation, including those that affect essential physical or biological features. The appropriate Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, which may involve acquiring land to protect endangered species. Recovery plans tend to focus on birds and mammals, but a 1988 ESA amendment prohibits favoring specific taxonomic groups. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species. The ESA and its regulations lack detail on recovery plan requirements, and these plans are not binding on federal agencies or others, leading to criticism of their hortatory nature. The ESA lacks detail on recovery plan requirements, making the plans non-binding on federal agencies. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans for U.S. species. Land may be acquired for conservation using funds from the LWCF, derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states in conserving protected species and may enter into cooperative agreements for federal funds. The ESA requires cooperation between the Secretary and states for conserving protected species, with federal funds available through cooperative agreements. The 1988 amendments established a fund for state grants, with Congress appropriating $53.5 million for FY2016. Matching funds from states are typically required, and federal actions affecting listed species must be evaluated. The fund for state grants under the ESA requires annual appropriation, with $53.5 million allocated for cooperative activities in FY2016. Federal actions impacting listed species must undergo a biological assessment to determine the need for formal consultation to ensure actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat. This process is known as a Section 7 consultation. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat, known as a Section 7 consultation. If an action is found to be safe, a biological opinion is issued along with an incidental take statement. The ESA requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to avoid harm to endangered species or critical habitat. If an action is deemed safe, a biological opinion is issued with an incidental take statement. If the action poses a risk, the Secretary must suggest alternatives to avoid harm to the species. The BiOp is based on the best available scientific and commercial data. The Secretary must suggest alternatives to avoid harm to the species in critical habitat. The BiOp is based on the best available scientific and commercial data, and includes a summary of the information. Consultations usually result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or reasonable and prudent alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary is generally required to complete consultation within 90 days for federal actions. The majority of consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or offer reasonable and prudent alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary must complete consultation within 90 days for federal actions, with the possibility of extending up to 150 days with mutual agreement. Formal consultation may take a year or more, and if no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or obtain an exemption. The Endangered Species Act requires formal consultation for proposed agency actions that may harm species. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties, or seek an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee. The Endangered Species Act requires formal consultation for proposed agency actions that may harm species. Exemptions are available only for actions, not for species. A high-level Endangered Species Committee decides whether to allow the action to proceed despite future harm to a species. The committee consists of specified federal officials and representatives from affected states. The law includes rules and deadlines for applying for exemptions, a full administrative hearing, and stringent rules for the committee in deciding whether to grant an exemption. The Secretary of Defense can determine if an exemption must be granted. The Endangered Species Act requires formal consultation for proposed agency actions that may harm species. Exemptions are available only for actions, not for species. The law includes rules and deadlines for applying for exemptions, a full administrative hearing, and stringent rules for the Endangered Species Committee in deciding whether to grant an exemption. The Secretary of Defense can determine if an exemption must be granted for national security reasons. Additionally, the President may decide to exempt a project for the repair or replacement of facilities in presidentially declared disaster areas. To be eligible for an exemption, federal agencies must have carried out consultation processes required under the ESA in good faith. To be eligible for an exemption under the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies must have carried out consultation processes required under the ESA in good faith. The agency must also have made a reasonable effort to develop modifications or alternatives to the proposed action that would not harm endangered species or critical habitat, conducted biological assessments, and refrained from irreversible commitments of resources. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult, develop alternatives, and refrain from irreversible commitments before seeking an exemption. The exemption process aims to ensure meaningful consideration of issues and avoid preempting actions already taken. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations for granting exemptions based on evidence of no reasonable alternatives. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult, develop alternatives, and refrain from irreversible commitments before seeking an exemption. The exemption process involves granting exemptions for projects or activities based on specific criteria, including the absence of reasonable alternatives, clear benefits outweighing alternative actions, regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments that jeopardize species or critical habitat. Special provisions may apply in certain instances as specified by the ESA. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult, develop alternatives, and refrain from irreversible commitments before seeking an exemption. The exemption process involves specific criteria such as regional or national significance and no irreversible commitments that jeopardize species or critical habitat. Special provisions may apply in certain instances as specified by the ESA, making the exemption process complex and potentially lengthy. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act is complex and lengthy, taking up to 280 days for approval. Applicants must fund mitigation measures for the duration of the action, potentially forever. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily on other areas, posing challenges for governors trying to balance state interests. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act can be challenging as it applies to the action, not the species itself. This can shift the burden of conservation and recovery to other areas, making it difficult for governors to balance state interests. Additionally, parties involved may be hesitant to support actions that could lead to the extinction of a species. The consultation process offers federal agencies various opportunities to address these challenges. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act provides federal agencies with opportunities to modify actions to avoid harming species or their habitats, even without the need for an exemption. Private parties may obtain permits for incidental take of species for lawful actions without a federal nexus. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to consider ESA consequences early on to avoid conflicts and exemptions. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of species without a federal nexus by submitting a habitat conservation plan. The use of this provision was expanded in the 1990s, with streamlined procedures for activities with minimal impacts. Other provisions include exemptions for raptors, regulations for subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and prohibitions on interstate transport and sale. The Endangered Species Act includes provisions for streamlined procedures, exemptions for raptors, regulations for subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and prohibitions on interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts. It also specifies prohibited acts such as taking endangered species and violating regulations. The Endangered Species Act prohibits various acts such as taking endangered species, possessing or selling unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations. Threatened species are also protected under similar provisions as endangered species. Exceptions to these prohibitions include incidental take permits. Violating the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by soliciting or causing prohibited acts is a violation. The ESA applies broadly to anyone under U.S. jurisdiction, with exceptions like incidental take permits. Civil penalties may be imposed for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators or those involved in importing/exporting wildlife. Good-faith belief in self-defense against endangered species can exempt from penalties. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) imposes civil penalties for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators and importers/exporters of wildlife. Violations may also lead to criminal charges. The ESA allows individuals to bring lawsuits in federal court to enforce its provisions, with the possibility of awarding litigation costs. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows individuals to bring lawsuits in federal court to enforce its provisions, with the possibility of awarding litigation costs and attorneys' fees. Citizen suits have been a driving force in the ESA's history, compelling agencies to focus on conserving species and potentially leading to listings of species at greater risk. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows citizen groups to drive listings of species at risk, often in conflict with development. Citizen suits challenging delays in listing decisions are common, leading to numerous lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States, grouping listed species by extinction risk. The United States implements legislation for CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention, focusing on trade and wildlife protection. CITES categorizes species based on extinction risk, while the Western Hemisphere Convention aims to establish nature reserves and control international wildlife trade. The ESA makes violations of CITES U.S. law within its jurisdiction. The United States implements legislation for CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention, focusing on trade and wildlife protection. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority specified under CITES, with authority to enforce determinations through FWS. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES, must ensure that international trade of living or dead organisms does not harm the species. The Secretary enforces determinations through FWS and is responsible for export determinations based on the best available biological information. The Secretary is also the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, ensuring legal export and import of specimens and suitable shipping conditions for live specimens. The Management Authority for the United States under CITES, also known as the Interior, is responsible for ensuring legal export and import of specimens and suitable shipping conditions for live specimens. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife (excluding shellfish and fishery products) must obtain permission from the Secretary to engage in such activities. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires importers and exporters of fish or wildlife to obtain permission from the Secretary for trade-related activities. An Endangered Species Committee (ESC) made a decision on an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam project in Wyoming, impacting the migration path of whooping cranes. The Endangered Species Committee granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir project in Wyoming, despite potential harm to whooping crane habitat on the Platte River. The decision included mitigation measures and a trust fund for habitat maintenance. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition from various groups, including local landowners and Indian tribes, after the endangered snail darter was listed. This led to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill, clarifying the reach of the Endangered Species Act and the ratification of public works projects. Congress then passed P.L. 95-632, establishing an ESC process and providing an automatic exemption for the dam. The Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the Endangered Species Act's broad reach and its relation to public works projects. Congress passed P.L. 95-632, establishing an ESC process and providing an exemption for the Tellico Dam.

The Bureau of Land Management sought exemptions for timber sales in the habitat of the northern spotted owl in 1992. In three instances, companies applied for exemptions under the Clinton Administration: Pittston Company for a refinery in Eastport, ME, Consolidated Grain and Barge Company for a docking area in Mound City, IL, and Suwanee River Authority for a dredging project in Suwanee Sound, Florida. However, no ESC decisions were made on these applications. The Suwanee River Authority applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for endangered manatees. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the engineer's unauthorized application was later withdrawn in 1986."
