    "content": "This report examines recent laws and congressional proposals regarding gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District. The report analyzes recent laws and congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia, focusing on the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008. Congressional proposals, such as Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress, aim to amend the District's gun laws. The report examines the differences between these proposals and current DC law, tracing their impact on firearms regulations in the District. The report traces the impact of recent laws and congressional proposals on gun regulation in the District of Columbia, focusing on the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008. It highlights the changes proposed by Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress, in relation to current DC law and the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. The Supreme Court's decision in Heller declared unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the registration of handguns, carrying a pistol without a license, and requirements for firearm storage. The Supreme Court's decision in Heller declared unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the registration of handguns, carrying a pistol without a license, and requirements for firearm storage. After the decision, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the ruling while considering permanent legislation, which was met with criticism. The DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling in Heller, which led to the introduction of H.R. 6691 in Congress to amend the city's gun laws. H.R. 6691 was later incorporated into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House of Representatives. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 6691, a proposal to amend DC's gun laws, was incorporated into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but not in the Senate. In the 111th Congress, S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160, based on H.R. 6842, was approved by the Senate but movement on the legislation stalled. In 2009, the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. The legislation amended firearms provisions of the DC Code related to the Heller case. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. These acts amended firearms provisions of the DC Code related to the Heller case and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. The District's new firearms amendments were challenged and upheld in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the District's new firearms amendments, which were challenged. Recent congressional legislation, H.R. 645, aims to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards in the United States. Title II- S. 160 limits the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repeals the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws establish minimum standards in the United States, allowing states and territories to supplement with their own laws. The District has authority to create its own laws under the Home Rule Act. The District of Columbia has the authority to create its own firearms laws under the Home Rule Act, allowing the DC Council to regulate firearms through police regulations. This power has been used to amend laws passed by Congress, although Congress still retains the ability to legislate for the District. The District of Columbia has the authority to regulate firearms through police regulations as deemed necessary by the Council. Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on the District of Columbia government's legislative authority. The District of Columbia has the authority to regulate firearms through police regulations as deemed necessary by the Council, while Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on the District of Columbia government's legislative authority, including the power to amend or repeal laws within or outside the scope of legislative power granted to the Council. The District of Columbia's legislative authority over firearms can be limited by Congress, as seen in Section 3 of H.R. 645. This section prohibits the District from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms not prohibited by Federal law. The District of Columbia is restricted from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms not prohibited by Federal law. This includes acquiring, possessing, transporting, or using firearms for legitimate purposes. The Council is not authorized to create laws related to firearms regulation under any provision of law. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the Council in the District of Columbia would not have the authority to create laws related to firearms regulation. It aims to prevent any constructive prohibition or undue burden on individuals acquiring firearms and prohibits the District from barring possession of firearms not prohibited by federal law. The proposed language in H.R. 645 aims to prevent the District of Columbia from creating its own firearms regulations beyond federal laws. It limits the District's ability to impose stricter provisions and unclear on what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. Additionally, it restricts the District's authority to enforce sanctions for criminal misuse of firearms. The proposed language in H.R. 645 aims to limit the District of Columbia's ability to create its own firearms regulations beyond federal laws. It also restricts the District's authority to enforce sanctions for criminal misuse of firearms and does not explicitly empower it to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The proposed language in H.R. 645 aims to limit the District of Columbia's ability to create its own firearms regulations beyond federal laws. It does not explicitly empower the District to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether, but could still argue for a ban on open or concealed carry. This differs from Title II- S. 160, which stated that the District could regulate or prohibit the carrying of firearms. The District of Columbia's authority to regulate firearms is limited by H.R. 645, which does not allow for a ban on carrying firearms. The previous definition of \"machine gun\" in the DC Code was broad, including any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. This restricted the registration of pistols mainly to revolvers. Under the District's old definition, a \"machine gun\" was any weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, limiting pistol registration to revolvers. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot with a single trigger function. The FCAA aligned the District's definition with the federal one. The District amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. However, they also enacted a list of prohibited firearms. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, aligning with the federal definition. This would allow semiautomatic handguns to be registered for self-defense, which was previously prohibited post-1976. The FCAA allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns, as long as the applicant meets requirements. There is an exemption for temporary possession of a registered firearm in another person's home for self-defense. Amendments have been made to the qualification and information requirements for firearm registration. The FCAA allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, with amendments to qualification requirements. Prohibited individuals include those with recent convictions for intrafamily offenses or multiple DUI violations. Applicants with a history of violent behavior or civil protection orders are also restricted. The FCAA prohibits individuals with a history of violent behavior, civil protection orders, or recent DUI violations from registering a firearm. Applicants must complete a firearms training course and provide an affidavit signed by a certified instructor. The Chief of Police must conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and can only register one pistol per person every 30 days, except for new residents. H.R. 645 expands the firearms competency test and requires the Chief of Police to conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols. The Chief is limited to registering one pistol per person every 30 days, except for new residents. The registration requirement would be repealed, eliminating the need for a registration certificate as a prerequisite for purchasing a firearm in DC. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, eliminating the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. It would also remove restrictions on the number of handguns an individual can purchase per month. H.R. 645 would amend DC law to remove the requirement for ballistics testing of pistols and the limit on purchasing one handgun per month. It would also allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the need for an ammunition certificate. Section 5 of H.R. 645 would allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, excluding restricted pistol bullets. This provision eliminates the need for an ammunition certificate and the requirement for licensed dealers to track ammunition inventory. Additionally, both H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 permit interstate purchase of firearms, but through different methods. Title II- S. 160 proposes an amendment to federal law to allow federal licensees to transfer handguns to out-of-state persons. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose different methods for interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 suggests amending federal law to allow licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. On the other hand, H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to allow Maryland and Virginia firearms dealers to sell handguns to District residents. Under the proposed legislation, Maryland and Virginia firearms dealers would be allowed to sell handguns to District residents if certain legal conditions are met, aligning with DC law. The District's trigger lock requirement, previously deemed unconstitutional, exceeded federal regulations on firearm storage and safety devices. Dealers can sell handguns with secure storage or safety devices, but there is no federal requirement on firearm storage. The District's trigger lock requirement, previously declared unconstitutional, now mandates firearms in lawful possession to be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. Under the Firearm Control Amendment Act (FCAA), the District requires firearms in lawful possession to be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. It prohibits storing loaded firearms where minors can access them without permission, with penalties for negligent storage. The FCAA requires firearms to be securely stored to prevent access by minors. Violations can result in criminal penalties. H.R. 645 imposes penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms, leading to injury. H.R. 645 imposes penalties for unlawfully storing loaded firearms where minors can access them, resulting in injury or death. Penalties include a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year, with exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks. Exceptions to penalties for unlawfully storing loaded firearms where minors can access them include securely locked containers, trigger locks, self-defense, hunting or target shooting under supervision, unlawful entry, and law enforcement possession. Under DC law, exceptions to penalties for unlawfully storing loaded firearms where minors can access them include self-defense, hunting or target shooting under supervision, and law enforcement possession. Violating the registration scheme can result in fines up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to one year, with a second offense carrying a fine of up to $5,000. The registration scheme in DC imposes fines and imprisonment for unregistered possession of firearms, with penalties increasing for repeat offenses. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision, while Title II- S. 160 seeks to remove criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors. Amendments to firearms laws in DC also include redefining terms like \"machine gun\" and \"firearm.\" The FCAA and IPAA are intended to work together in regulating firearms. Section 9 of H.R. 645 aims to harmonize definitions of key terms related to firearms between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. The IPAA allows the District of Columbia to restrict possession of firearms on its property and permits private entities to do the same. The IPAA amended DC law to allow the District of Columbia and private property owners to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their property. Private persons or entities owning property in DC may restrict firearms except for law enforcement personnel. Section 10 of H.R. 645 also addresses property owners restricting firearms on their premises. The IPAA amended DC law to allow private property owners in the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their premises. This includes the ability for private landlords to restrict their tenants from possessing firearms. Additionally, Section 10 of H.R. 645 gives the District the authority to restrict or prohibit the possession of firearms on public property, including buildings or areas under its control with implemented security measures. The District of Columbia has the authority to restrict or prohibit the possession of firearms on public property, specifically within buildings or structures under its control with security measures in place. This proposed language is more specific than current law, applying only to buildings or structures under District control. The proposed language in the District of Columbia would restrict firearms possession in buildings or structures under its control, but it is unclear if this extends to all real property. The authority would not apply to lessees in these buildings, but the scope of buildings affected is ambiguous. The District of Columbia's proposed language aims to regulate firearms possession in buildings under its control, but the extent of this authority is unclear. It is uncertain whether the regulation applies to all buildings or only those with security measures. The IPAA would repeal the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, a provision that would be eliminated with the enactment of H.R. 645. The IPAA would repeal the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, which would be reinstated with the enactment of H.R. 645. Additionally, the provision prohibits carrying a rifle or shotgun in the District of Columbia, except as permitted by law. States can also impose their own laws on carrying firearms. The District of Columbia currently permits individuals with valid firearm registrations to carry handguns, rifles, or shotguns in specific circumstances, such as within their home, for recreational purposes, at their place of business, or while being transported for lawful purposes. The Chief's authority to issue carry licenses has been revoked under the IPAA, limiting the scenarios in which a person may possess and carry firearms. H.R. 645 aims to reinstate the Chief's authority for concealed carry licenses. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in their dwelling house, place of business, on land owned by them, by invitation on another's land, for recreational or training purposes, or while being transported for lawful purposes. H.R. 645 would restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing firearm owners to carry outside specific circumstances. The bill also maintains provisions for lawful transportation of firearms. H.R. 645 would allow firearm owners to obtain a concealed carry license for carrying their firearms outside specific circumstances. The bill maintains provisions for lawful transportation of firearms, requiring them to be unloaded and secured during transport. The IPAA made a technical change to the District Code by including toy and antique pistols as types of firearms prohibited from being used in violent crimes. H.R. 645 would provide jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. H.R. 645 would grant jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases involving firearms dealer licenses, repealing the registration scheme and certain provisions of the DC Code. The provisions discussed in H.R. 645 would repeal the FCAA and IPAA, impacting the DC Code's regulations on dealer licenses and firearm transfers. The new requirements created by the FCAA would be necessary to obtain a registration certificate for dealer activities. The FCAA created new requirements for obtaining a registration certificate for dealer activities, including purchasing or transferring firearms. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing qualified individuals to apply for a dealer's license and engage in firearm transactions. Federal prohibitions on firearm possession are also discussed. Reporting duties for firearms and ammunition inventory would be repealed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, drug users, mentally ill individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, and others. Reporting duties for firearms and ammunition inventory would be repealed under H.R. 645. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, drug users, mentally ill individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, and others. It is unlawful for both licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer a firearm to individuals who fall within specific categories, such as those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. New eligibility requirements have been imposed by the FCAA for obtaining a registration certificate. Under the federal GCA, it is illegal for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell firearms to individuals in prohibited categories, including those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. The FCAA also imposes new eligibility requirements for registration certificates, which must be met by anyone transferring firearms in DC. Non-licensed individuals can only sell firearms to licensed dealers under DC law, even in private sales. This rule would not change under H.R. 645. Under the FCAA and DC law, only licensed dealers can transfer firearms, including in private sales between non-licensed individuals. H.R. 645 would eliminate the registration requirement under DC law, making only federal disqualifications applicable for transfers. The assault weapons ban under the FCAA would also be impacted by this bill. The FCAA and DC law require licensed dealers for firearm transfers, with H.R. 645 aiming to remove DC registration and apply only federal disqualifications. The bill would affect the assault weapons ban by including specific criteria for defining assault weapons. The FCAA and DC law require licensed dealers for firearm transfers, with H.R. 645 aiming to remove DC registration and apply only federal disqualifications. The bill would affect the assault weapons ban by including specific criteria for defining assault weapons, which also includes any shotgun with a revolving cylinder, except for certain exceptions. The Chief has the power to designate as an assault weapon any firearm that poses a similar threat as those enumerated in the definition, with antique firearms and certain pistols exempted. The new definition of assault weapon is applicable in the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, holding manufacturers, importers, or dealers strictly liable for damages resulting from the discharge of the assault weapon. The FCAA prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC, defined as devices holding more than 10 rounds. This provision would be repealed by H.R. 645. The FCAA prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC, defined as holding more than 10 rounds. This provision would be repealed by H.R. 645. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers must run a background check through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System before transferring a firearm to a non-licensed person. Once approved, the firearm can be transferred unless a state imposes a waiting period. Non-licensed persons are not required to perform a background check. The IPAA imposes a 10-day waiting period for the transfer of all firearms, regardless of operability, design, or type. This waiting period applies to both licensed dealers and non-licensed persons, unlike the previous 48-hour waiting period in the DC Code for pistol or handgun transfers. The IPAA imposes a 10-day waiting period for the transfer of all firearms, not just pistols. If repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA added provisions for microstamping and requiring unique identification or serial numbers on firearms. The FCAA introduces new provisions for microstamping on firearms, specifically semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. It requires manufacturers to ensure pistols are microstamp-ready and provide necessary information to law enforcement. New Section 503 of the FCAA sets requirements for determining if a semiautomatic pistol is microstamp-ready and mandates manufacturers to provide necessary information to law enforcement. Section 504 prohibits the manufacture, sale, or possession of pistols not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale in the District of Columbia after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned and registered before that date. The FCAA prohibits the ownership or possession of certain pistols in DC unless lawfully owned and registered before January 1, 2009. Residents can only sell or transfer these pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the California Roster annually for updates. The IPAA requires a special permit for firearm discharge, except for self-defense. The Chief is authorized to revise the roster of handguns not deemed unsafe annually. The IPAA requires a special permit for firearm discharge, except for self-defense, and allows the District to restrict possession of firearms on its property. Private property owners in the District can also restrict firearm possession, except for law enforcement personnel."
