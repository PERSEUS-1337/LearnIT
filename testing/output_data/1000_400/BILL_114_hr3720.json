    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program, established within the Environmental Protection Agency, aims to promote water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products in the market as preferred technologies. The WaterSense program, under the EPA, promotes water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use and conserve resources. The Administrator of the EPA is tasked with promoting WaterSense labeled products in the market as preferred technologies, ensuring performance standards are met. The WaterSense program aims to promote water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes through various means such as public outreach, education, and research. It also focuses on establishing and maintaining performance standards for WaterSense labeled products to ensure optimal performance and publicizing the importance of proper installation and maintenance. Regular reviews and updates are conducted to preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label. The WaterSense program aims to promote water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes through public outreach, education, and research. It focuses on maintaining performance standards for WaterSense labeled products and regularly updating criteria. Data on market shares and water/energy savings of labeled products are made available to the public. The WaterSense program regularly updates criteria for labeled products, buildings, and landscapes. It estimates and shares water and energy savings data with the public. Comments from interested parties are solicited before establishing or revising any WaterSense category or criterion. Interested parties are notified of any changes in criteria adoption. The WaterSense program updates criteria for labeled products, buildings, and landscapes, providing notice and explanations for changes to interested parties. Lead time is given before new or revised criteria take effect. The WaterSense program updates criteria for labeled products, buildings, and landscapes, providing notice and explanations for changes to interested parties. Lead time is given before new or revised criteria take effect, and voluntary approaches like labeling waterless devices or promoting reuse and recycling technologies are encouraged to improve water efficiency. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2016-2019 and beyond, totaling $87.5 million, is allocated to promote water efficiency through voluntary approaches like labeling waterless devices and encouraging reuse and recycling technologies. Federal procurement of water efficient products is mandated. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" \"FEMP designated product,\" and \"product and service.\" These definitions are important for understanding the requirements related to water efficiency in federal procurement. In federal procurement, a \"product\" is defined as a high-efficiency product under the Federal Energy Management Program, excluding water-consuming products for combat missions. Agencies must procure WaterSense products for water efficiency requirements. In federal procurement, agencies must procure WaterSense products or FEMP designated products for water efficiency requirements. WaterSense plumbing products should be installed by certified plumbers for optimal performance. In federal procurement, agencies must procure WaterSense products or FEMP designated products for water efficiency requirements. A WaterSense irrigation system should be installed, maintained, and audited by a WaterSense-certified professional for optimal performance. Exceptions exist if a cost-effective alternative is not available or does not meet agency requirements. In federal procurement, agencies must procure WaterSense products or FEMP designated products for water efficiency requirements. The head of an agency shall incorporate criteria for rating WaterSense products and services and FEMP designated products into procurement specifications and evaluation factors for offers received. The head of an agency must consider measures to reduce water consumption, including reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, leak detection, and use of waterless products. WaterSense and FEMP designated products must be clearly identified in federal catalogs. The head of an agency must consider measures to reduce water consumption, including reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, leak detection, and use of waterless products. WaterSense and FEMP designated products shall be prominently displayed in federal catalogs by the General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days to implement the use of WaterSense and FEMP designated products in federal agencies, unless specified otherwise in writing. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like Administrator, eligible entity, incentive program, and residential water efficient products. Eligible entities include government bodies, utilities, and nonprofits. The incentive program offers financial incentives for residential water efficient products and services. Consumer purchase and installation of residential water efficient products and services, such as faucets, irrigation technologies, point-of-use water treatment devices, toilets, etc., must meet specific efficiency and performance criteria set by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories of water efficient products and services, such as faucets, irrigation technologies, point-of-use water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads, must be tested and certified by an accredited third-party certifying body or laboratory to be considered residential water efficient products. The WaterSense program requires products to be tested and certified by an accredited third-party certifying body before they can use the program's label. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States, including territories like Puerto Rico and Guam. The WaterSense program requires products to be certified by a third-party before using the label. Eligible entities can receive allocations by establishing incentive programs for water-efficient products, submitting applications, and providing assurances to the Administrator. The Administrator determines allocations for eligible entities based on population served and target population for incentive programs. The entities must apply and provide assurances to use the allocation to supplement existing funds. The Administrator determines allocations for eligible entities based on population served, target population for incentive programs, effectiveness of existing programs, and prior year's allocation. Funds allocated can cover up to 50% of establishing and carrying out incentive programs. Entities allocated funds can use up to 50% to establish and run incentive programs, including fixture recycling. Financial incentives can be given to consumers who meet program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. Financial incentives may be provided to consumers who meet program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The amount of the incentive is determined by various factors, including the entity's allocation, available tax incentives, and the need to encourage consumer behavior towards water-efficient products and services. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section introduces a program for incentivizing the adoption of water-efficient products. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section exempts individuals from including amounts received under an incentive program in gross income. It also denies double benefits for any expenditure covered by the incentive program. The amendments made by this Act regarding early adopter water efficient products incentive programs will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment date."
