The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measure, potentially resulting in significant cuts to assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean. Questions for Members of Congress to consider include whether the request aligns with U.S. interests, effectiveness of aid programs in the region, potential impact of proposed aid cuts, and resource coordination for maximizing impact of foreign assistance funds. The U.S. government agencies need better coordination for foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean to avoid unnecessary overlap. Despite some ongoing initiatives, there is no formal framework for sharing information among State Department, USAID, and DOD. The GAO report highlighted the lack of coordination among State, USAID, and DOD in their assistance efforts, leading to potential overlap. Better coordination could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of programs. The OECD reported that Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in development assistance in 2010, with the U.S. providing $2.7 billion. According to the OECD, Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in development assistance in 2010. The lack of coordination among international donors has led to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts and more efficient use of limited funds for foreign assistance. The lack of coordination among international donors in Latin America and the Caribbean has led to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts and more efficient use of limited funds for foreign assistance, but challenges exist in determining leadership and division of labor. Strategic objectives may also impact aid programs' efficiency and donors' strategic interests. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming to access new solutions and expertise. This collaboration combines best practices with larger financial resources to multiply the impact of development programs.

Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments. Members of Congress may consider agencies' comparative advantages, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies, and enhancing inter-agency coordination for foreign assistance programs. Members of Congress may consider agencies' comparative advantages, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies, enhancing inter-agency coordination for foreign assistance programs, ensuring funds are used in accordance with U.S. law, and examining foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations. When considering foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress should assess political will and program sustainability to ensure effective use of U.S. funds. Partner nations must be willing to implement reforms and sustain programs for long-term impact. The political will of partner nations in Latin America and the Caribbean is crucial for the effective use of U.S. assistance. Without willingness to implement reforms and sustain programs, the impact of aid may be limited. Colombia has shown success in this regard, allowing for a managed transition of assistance programs as the country takes on more responsibility. USAID is also closing its mission in Panama and ending voluntary family planning programs. The United States has implemented reforms and raised revenue in Latin American countries, leading to a managed transition of assistance programs as partner nations take on more financial responsibility. Despite successes, there have been challenges with political will in the region, hindering sustained efforts initiated with U.S. support. Political will has often been lacking in Latin America, impacting the sustainability of efforts initiated with U.S. support. Studies have shown that U.S.-funded programs in the region have struggled due to insufficient government revenue, leading to issues with program sustainability even with MCC-funded projects. Studies have shown that U.S.-funded projects in Latin America face sustainability challenges, even with MCC-funded assistance. A study in Honduras revealed that roads built for small farmers may not be maintained due to lack of equipment, expertise, and funding. When considering foreign aid for Latin American countries, Congress should assess the host country's capacity for maintenance, plans for financial responsibility, and the timeline for building technical and financial sustainability.
