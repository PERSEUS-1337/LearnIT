    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law of 2010 did not alter these requirements. The federal mental health parity requirements, established by the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, include coverage terms such as limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not change these requirements, which apply to insurers covering mental health and substance use disorder services in certain plan types. The federal parity law, including the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, applies to insurers covering mental health and substance use disorder services in certain plan types. The ACA expands the law's applicability to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans offered through Exchanges. QHPs must comply with federal parity law in the same manner as other health insurance plans. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans offered through Exchanges. QHPs, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans must comply with federal parity law. Medicaid may be offered in traditional state plan benefits or through managed care plans, with Medicaid benchmark plans required to partially comply with federal parity law for mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Medicaid benchmark plans. These plans are only required to ensure that treatment limitations and financial requirements are on par for mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services. Fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt from federal parity law compliance. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicare are also not covered by federal parity law. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. Small employer group health plans are exempt from federal parity law, including \"groups of one.\" The ACA did not amend the small employer exemption, so it remains in effect. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid may not be subject to federal parity law due to certain coverage structures. The ACA did not change the small employer exemption, which remains in effect. Federal parity law does not apply to fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. Parity requirements may not be applicable to fee-for-service Medicaid due to coverage structure. Medicare requires copayments for mental health services to be 20% by 2014. Federal parity law aims to reduce disparities in coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. The federal parity law aims to reduce disparities in coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services by requiring parity with medical and surgical services. The ACA did not change the mandated offering parity approach, where coverage of mental health services is not required but must be at parity if covered. The ACA did not change the mandated offering parity approach, where coverage of mental health services is not required but must be at parity if covered. The ACA included broader changes requiring coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services in health insurance marketplaces. Plans offered in the Exchanges must meet requirements, including offering a minimum set of benefits. The ACA requires health insurance plans in the Exchanges to offer a minimum set of benefits, including the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) which includes mental health and substance use disorder services. The Secretary of HHS defines the items and services in the EHB, with 10 categories of services required to be included. The Secretary of HHS defines the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) with 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The benefits in the EHB must be of \"equal scope\" to those in a typical employer plan, as determined by a survey conducted by the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor released a report on employer-sponsored coverage to the HHS Secretary, finding that most health plans offer mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The ACA does not mandate specific services in the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP), which will be determined through rulemaking. The HHS Secretary has discretion to include additional benefits beyond the 10 required categories. The EHBP will be determined through the rulemaking process, with the HHS Secretary having discretion to include additional benefits. In December 2011, HHS released an informational bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define the EHB using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four benchmark options. The HHS proposal allows states to define essential health benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options, and the benefits covered by the designated benchmark plan would be the EHBP for the state. Additionally, the HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct a study on determining the EHB. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study the determination of Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The IOM released a report on the criteria for the EHB, which does not recommend specific services. The ACA mandates plans to offer either the EHBP or the EHB, including coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA mandates plans to offer either the EHBP or the EHB, including coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. This requirement applies to new plans in the individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA mandates coverage of EHBP or EHB for new plans in individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans by January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of Exchanges are exempt. The health reform law will increase access to mental health and substance use disorder services. The health reform law mandates coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services for many plans, potentially leading to voluntary compliance with federal parity law to stay competitive in the private market."
