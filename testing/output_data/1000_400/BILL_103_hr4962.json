Monitoring will assess restoration effectiveness and address any remaining issues. A land management plan will be developed collaboratively to reduce health and environmental risks in the Basin. The Coeur d'Alene Basin restoration plan involves developing a land management plan with various agencies to reduce health and environmental risks. Additionally, an integrated geographical information system will be maintained to coordinate management activities. Wildlife and fishery habitat management plans will also be created in collaboration with relevant organizations. The Coeur d'Alene Basin restoration plan includes developing wildlife and fishery habitat management plans with various agencies to ensure long-term coordinated management. This involves monitoring wildlife management areas for effectiveness and developing an integrated public recreation management plan to provide public information and minimize risks. The Coeur d'Alene Basin restoration plan involves collaborating with various agencies to develop an integrated public recreation management plan and implement a lake and river information program to provide public use and health risk information.
