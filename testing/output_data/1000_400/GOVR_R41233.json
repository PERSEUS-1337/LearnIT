    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance make up a significant portion of HUD's funding. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other specialized grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD receives most of its funding from Congress for housing programs, with block grants like HOME and CDBG supporting low-income housing and community development. Specialized grants aid homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset HUD's budget costs, which has also received emergency supplemental funding in recent years. HUD's budget is supported by surplus FHA funds and emergency supplemental funding. In recent years, significant amounts of emergency funding have been provided for recovery assistance after natural disasters. Regular funding for HUD has increased by 57% in the past nine years, with a growing rate of growth in recent years. Table 1 shows HUD's total enacted appropriations over the past five years, with a 57% increase in regular funding in the past nine years. The growth rate has been increasing in recent years, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year. Adjusting for inflation, the real funding growth has been about 17% over the nine-year period. Most of the growth has occurred in the last two years. HUD's budget has grown by about 17% over a nine-year period, with most of the growth occurring in the last two years. The funding is made up of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations, fund HUD's programs and activities. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in some years. HUD's funding is primarily from regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters. These emergency funds are typically provided outside of regular appropriations acts and are in addition to the regular annual appropriations. Congressional appropriators are limited in the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide each year, leading them to either reduce regular annual appropriations or find offsets. The cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations is offset through rescissions and receipts from fees paid by partners. This interaction determines HUD's total net budget authority, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The total net budget authority of HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets from rescissions, receipts, and collections. This net budget authority is not necessarily the best measure of funding for HUD's programs and activities, as shown by the increase in net non-emergency budget authority from over $29 billion to over $46 billion between FY2002 and FY2010. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion. However, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during the same period, while offsetting receipts and collections declined by more than 70% and rescinded amounts decreased by 96%. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% from FY2002 to FY2010, reaching over $46 billion. Regular appropriations grew by 37%, mainly due to growth in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs. Offset receipts and collections decreased by over 70% and rescinded amounts dropped by 96% during the same period. The 37% growth in regular appropriations from FY2002 to FY2010 is largely due to the increase in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which accounted for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. The Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs accounted for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010, showing a 37% growth from FY2002. Funding for other HUD programs also started to increase in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs contributed to the overall decrease in available funds for new HUD appropriations. The HUD appropriations have decreased significantly from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Congress must enact appropriations legislation before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. In years when Congress doesn't finish appropriations action, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted to maintain funding at prior year levels. The FY2011 appropriations process began in February 2010 and concluded later. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD began in February 2010 and concluded with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 1% from the previous year. The FY2011 appropriations for HUD began in February 2010 and concluded with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. The President's budget requested $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 1% decrease from the previous year. The budget proposed offsetting collections and receipts from changes to FHA mortgage insurance programs. The President's budget requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while decreasing funding for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House provided about $1 billion more than requested. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House on July 29, 2010 would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. This bill rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also rejected funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The Senate bill, like the House bill, rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also denied funding for initiatives such as Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The Senate bill would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President, with a 1% increase in net new budget authority over the FY2010 enacted level and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The Senate bill, similar to the House bill, rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also denied funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The bill would have provided a 1% increase in net new budget authority over FY2010 levels and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to fund federal accounts, including HUD's budget, at FY2010 levels. The last CR (P.L. 111-322) expired on March 4, 2011, leaving funding for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. The last continuing resolution (P.L. 111-322) expired on March 4, 2011, leaving funding for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. The House approved a year-long continuing resolution (H.R. 1) to fund the federal government through the end of FY2011, which would have provided about $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. H.R. 1 bill proposed funding cuts for HUD programs in FY2011, reducing aggregate appropriations by $5 billion (11%) compared to FY2010. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment (S.Amdt. 149) that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion without rescinding FY2010 funding. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment (S.Amdt. 149) that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion without rescinding FY2010 funding. This would have represented a reduction in net budget authority from FY2010, but an increase in aggregate appropriations compared to FY2010. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, with reduced funding for some accounts, including HUD's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. The CDF was funded at a level $195 million lower than FY2010, equivalent to the amount provided for congressional earmarks in FY2010. The CDF funding under H.J.Res. 44 was reduced by approximately $195 million compared to FY2010 levels. This reduction was equivalent to the funding provided for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives in FY2010. Subsequent short-term CRs continued the funding reduction for the CDF, with no funding provided for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account. The reduction in funding for the CDF included in H.J.Res. 44 and H.J.Res. 48 provided no funding for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account. A final short-term CR, P.L. 112-8, extended funding through April 15, 2011. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011, P.L. 112-10, provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for various government agencies, including HUD, with some programs funded at FY2010 levels and others reduced or increased. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for various government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a decrease of about 11% in net new budget authority for HUD. However, the requested decrease in net new budget authority would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to increased offsetting collections and receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The FY2011 appropriations for HUD included a 11% decrease in net new budget authority, but only a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to increased offsetting collections and receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more widely available at a lower cost. The provision of FHA insurance helps make mortgage credit more widely available at a lower cost. FHA home loan insurance programs are administered through two program accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI). The MMI Fund is the largest of the FHA insurance funds, primarily focusing on single-family home loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program into the MMI Fund, resulting in the establishment of two risk categories. The MMI Fund and GI/SRI Fund provide insurance for home mortgages, with the MMI Fund focusing on single-family loans and the GI/SRI Fund covering riskier mortgages and special-purpose loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the reverse mortgage program into the MMI Fund, creating two risk categories. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance by calculating the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows come from insurance premiums, while outflows are payments for loan defaults. The subsidy rate is the net value of these cash flows expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume. The subsidy rate is calculated as the difference between cash inflows from insurance premiums and cash outflows for loan defaults, expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume. This rate determines the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs over the life of the loans. The subsidy rate is the difference between cash inflows from insurance premiums and cash outflows for loan defaults, expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume. This determines the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. The MMI Fund historically has had a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government by making more in fees than paying out in claims. The MMI Fund historically had a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government by making more in fees than paying out in claims. It is divided into the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category and the MMI HECM risk category. The Purchase and Refinance risk category had a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, higher than the -0.62% estimated for FY2010. The MMI Fund is divided into the Purchase and Refinance risk category and the HECM risk category. For FY2011, the Purchase and Refinance category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59%, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. This increase is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy for this category. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy, including $960 million without FHA's proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. Despite lower projections than the Administration's, CBO still anticipated this category to be profitable in FY2011 and not require a positive credit subsidy. The CBO projected that the MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy, with $902 million from HUD-proposed program reforms. Despite lower projections than the Administration's, CBO still expected this category to be profitable in FY2011 and not require a positive credit subsidy. The appropriations law was enacted with an increase in the annual premium charged by FHA in April 2011. This change resulted in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for FY2011. FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for this category increased to nearly $10 billion for FY2011. CBO also increased its estimate of FHA receipts by over $1 billion from the beginning of the FY2011 appropriations process. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund, with a positive credit subsidy of 0.83% requiring a $250 million appropriation. HUD's changes to the HECM program in FY2010 were not enough to eliminate the need for a positive credit subsidy, leading to a proposed increase in HECM borrowers' annual fees for FY2011. In FY2011, HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed lower credit subsidies for HECMs than the Administration's estimate. The proposed changes to the HECM program aim to reduce the need for credit subsidies, with H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 offering lower subsidies than the Administration's estimate. The FY2012 appropriations law directed adjustments to the HECM program to achieve a zero credit subsidy, reflecting the increasing demand for FHA-insured mortgages due to tightening lending standards in the private market. FHA insured a growing percentage of new single-family mortgages, leading to higher mortgage insurance premiums. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing as the private market tightens its lending standards. FHA insured 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. The average credit score on FHA-insured loans has improved, but the default rate on past loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated that the MMI Fund must have a capital reserve ratio of at least 2%. The FHA-insured mortgages have improved credit quality, but the default rate on past loans is still rising, straining the MMI Fund. Congress mandated a 2% capital reserve ratio for the MMI Fund, which fell below that in FY2009. FHA has proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs in response to concerns over financial stability. During FY2009, the capital reserve ratio fell below 2% for the first time, prompting FHA to propose changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs. These changes include increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium, with a statutory cap set by Congress at 1.5% for borrowers with downpayments greater than 5% and 1.55% for those with downpayments of 5% or less. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted in August 2010, FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums to 0.9% for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 95% or higher, and 0.85% for loans below 95%. Subsequently, on April 18, 2011, FHA raised premiums to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less, and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. Congress also sets a cap on the upfront premium that FHA can charge. Beginning on October 4, 2010, FHA set the loan-to-value ratio below 95%. On April 18, 2011, FHA increased annual insurance premiums to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less, and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. The upfront mortgage insurance premium was also raised to 2.25% initially, then lowered to 1% for loans endorsed after April 5, 2010. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA raised the annual mortgage insurance premium and lowered the upfront mortgage insurance premium to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. FHA also proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a minimum 10% downpayment for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579. Additionally, FHA proposed reducing the allowable amount of seller concessions from 6% to 3%. FHA is considering changes such as increasing oversight of approved lenders, reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3%, and implementing a minimum 10% downpayment for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579. These changes can be made administratively and were solicited for comments in a Federal Register notice. FHA is increasing oversight of approved lenders and enforcing stricter requirements. Congress may grant FHA authority for additional enforcement actions through the FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072), which includes indemnification for non-conforming mortgages and fraud cases. The Act also allows FHA to terminate lenders with high default rates and establish a Deputy position within FHA. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aims to increase oversight of approved lenders and enforce stricter requirements. It includes provisions for indemnification on non-conforming mortgages and fraud cases, authority to terminate lenders with high default rates, and the establishment of a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA. Additionally, the Act authorizes appropriations for staff to review lender performance from FY2010 through FY2014. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs to nonprofit developers for building or rehabilitating housing units for elderly and disabled residents. Property owners in the Section 202 program may offer supportive services to residents, while in the Section 811 program, supportive services are mandatory. Over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing have been funded by HUD capital grants. HUD provides capital grants for Section 202 and Section 811 programs to nonprofit developers for housing units for elderly and disabled residents. Property owners in Section 202 may offer supportive services, while in Section 811, services are mandatory. Over 106,000 Section 202 units and 30,000 Section 811 units have been funded. The President proposed no new funding for these programs in FY2011 to redesign them, resulting in reduced funding. The President's proposal would have reduced funding for HUD Rental Housing Programs for Low-Income Elderly Residents. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million in FY2011, compared to $300 million in FY2010. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) would have maintained the same level of funding for Section 202 at $825 million. H.R. 5850 would have provided $300 million for the Section 811 program, while S. 3644 would have provided $200 million. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 bills aimed to maintain funding levels for Section 202 at $825 million and for Section 811 at $300 million and $200 million respectively. The difference in funding was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2010, $87 million was allocated for voucher renewals, with an increase to nearly $114 million in FY2011 according to HUD FY2011 budget documents. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $100 million for this purpose. In FY2010, $87 million of the Section 811 appropriation was allocated for voucher renewals, increasing to nearly $114 million in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $100 million less in funding for the Section 811 account due to moving voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based account. Ultimately, Congress appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs and $150 million for the Section 811 program. Funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts, with $32 million available for pre-2007 contracts and $35 million through the Section 8 account. In FY2010, $87 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, increasing to nearly $114 million in FY2011. The Section 811 program received $150 million in funding, with $67 million available for voucher renewals. Additionally, $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, funded through tenant-based rental assistance, is the largest program administered by HUD. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through tenant-based rental assistance and is the largest program administered by HUD. It received $89 million for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program. The program funds almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies and covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through tenant-based rental assistance and covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year, with debates focusing on funding levels for voucher renewals and efficient allocation to PHAs. In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals, allocating funding to PHAs based on prior year costs and utilization. The amount funded over 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility, but some vouchers were not utilized in FY2009. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications show that PHAs had about 94% of their vouchers in use. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals based on prior year costs and utilization. However, PHAs were not using all their vouchers in FY2009, with only about 94% in use. As a result, funding in FY2010 was only provided for vouchers that were being utilized, leading to some PHAs not receiving enough funding to cover all their vouchers. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals to ensure funding for all vouchers in use, estimated to be around 95%. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, with funding allocated based on prior year costs and utilization. PHAs with decreased costs or extra reserve funding could receive increased funding, allowing them to serve more families. HUD estimated that 95% of all vouchers would be funded, with the Secretary given authority to reallocate funding to PHAs with lower reserves. The President's FY2011 budget requested the Secretary to have the authority to reallocate funding from PHAs with high reserves to those with lower reserves, allowing for increased funding to serve more families. The budget also proposed lifting the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional leasing. The funding requested was deemed enough to maintain existing vouchers but not to fund all 2.3 million authorized by Congress. The President's FY2011 budget requested funding to maintain existing vouchers but not enough to fund all 2.3 million authorized by Congress. The House bill included $150 million less for renewals than requested, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report indicated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would meet renewal needs and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The formula for allocating renewal funding largely followed the President's request. The committee report on H.R. 5850 indicated that the funding included would meet the renewal needs of the program and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, as the committee believed the program needed major authorization changes outside of the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. The funding formula in H.R. 5850 would have based PHA funding on prior calendar year spending instead of prior fiscal year spending to better reflect the program's needs. The bill S. 3644 proposed changes to the funding formula for PHA funding, basing it on prior calendar year spending instead of fiscal year spending to better reflect program needs. It also funded renewals below the President's request, similar to H.R. 5850, and did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The committee expressed concerns about potential cost increases with such a policy. The Senate bill, like H.R. 5850, proposed changes to the funding formula for PHA funding, using calendar year spending instead of fiscal year spending. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases with this policy, and HUD was directed to report on plans for better financial management monitoring. Funding allocation formula remained unchanged in H.R. 1 and the final FY2011 appropriations law. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) changed the funding allocation formula from FY2010. Both provided less than requested by the President for renewals but more than in FY2010. The President requested funding for mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, with HUD requesting $114 million for this purpose in FY2011. The House and Senate bills proposed to adopt this request, but H.R. 1 did not explicitly include funding for renewing Section 811 vouchers. The final appropriations law appropriated less than requested by the President for Section 811 renewals. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) appropriated less than requested by the President for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million. Congress may create additional vouchers, including tenant protection vouchers for displaced families. In recent years, Congress has allocated around 2.3 million authorized vouchers across Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Additional vouchers, including tenant protection vouchers for displaced families, are sometimes created. Special populations or purposes may receive incremental vouchers, such as families in the child welfare system or homeless veterans. Funding has been allocated for new vouchers for supportive housing programs to prevent homelessness. The President's budget requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing to prevent homelessness. The House and Senate bills included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration, $75 million for VASH vouchers for homeless veterans, and $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes. The Senate bill also allocated $16 million for the Family Unification Program. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress would have funded the President's homelessness demonstration, provided $75 million for VASH vouchers, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program. H.R. 1 included no funding for new incremental vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The program provides funding to renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private property owners. Congress funded contracts for 20- to 40-year periods, but new annual appropriations are needed once contracts expire. Some contracts do not have sufficient funding to finish their terms, requiring new funding to complete them. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. HUD stated that the funding should cover all contracts needing renewal and amendment funding of $662 million. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications indicate that $662 million would be needed for amendment needs. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided just under $120 million less than the President's request. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. The funding would be used to transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance. The President's FY2011 budget requested $350 million for a new initiative to increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants by transferring housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility features. The goal is to transfer 300,000 units to this new assistance model. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program with tenant mobility features. Three categories of properties are targeted for transfer: public housing properties owned by local PHAs without a Section 8 program (150,000 units), public and multifamily properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities (130,000 units), and multifamily properties with old rental assistance programs (20,000 units). Properties in the first and third categories would be selected by HUD, while properties in the second category would compete by submitting plans. The funding requested is $300 million, with $290 million allocated for the initiative. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program with tenant mobility features. Properties in three categories are targeted for transfer: public housing properties without a Section 8 program, public and multifamily properties willing to combine administrative activities, and multifamily properties with old rental assistance programs. Most of the $300 million funding requested would be used to cover the difference between current subsidy levels and the new program's higher subsidy level. Additional funds would support landlord outreach, tenant mobility efforts, technical assistance, and program evaluation. The President's budget proposes transferring 300,000 housing units to a new project-based rental assistance program with tenant mobility features. $50 million would be used for combining PHA activities and promoting tenant mobility, $10 million for technical assistance and program evaluation. HUD would submit legislation for the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act. Committees expressed concerns about unknown future costs and rejected the proposal. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in the final FY2011 appropriations law. The President's proposal to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new rental assistance program was rejected due to concerns about unknown future costs. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in the final FY2011 appropriations law. Public housing program provides rental units for low-income families and is HUD's oldest housing assistance program. Congress continues to fund over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities owning 1.2 million units. HUD provides funding to over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for the maintenance and administration of 1.2 million units. The operating fund helps cover the gap between rent contributions and costs, while the capital fund supports large projects and modernization. The HOPE VI program focuses on redeveloping distressed housing into mixed-income communities. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund, citing the availability of capital funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HUD aims to help demolish and redevelop distressed public housing to create mixed-income communities. The Administration proposed fully funding the operating fund for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to allow more capital funds to be used for capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included a $500 million increase for the capital fund, with the Senate bill setting aside $50 million for early childhood education facilities in public housing. The bill proposed a $50 million set-aside from the capital fund for grants to PHAs for early childhood education facilities in public housing. It also required $10 million for safety measures. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than proposed but less than FY2010, and the operating fund was funded slightly lower than proposed. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be offset by PHAs' program reserves. The FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than proposed but less than FY2010, and the operating fund was funded slightly lower than proposed. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be offset by PHAs' program reserves. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI, instead requesting $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal to revitalize distressed neighborhoods. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative, modeled after the HOPE VI program, offers grants to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, not just public housing. Eligible entities include PHAs, local governments, nonprofits, and for-profit developers. Funding aims at transforming, rehabilitating, and replacing HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, $200 million was allocated to HOPE VI, with $65 million set aside for Choice Neighborhoods. Congress had differing positions on funding in FY2011. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to the HOPE VI program, with $65 million reserved for the Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. In FY2011, the House and Senate had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI but no funding for Choice Neighborhoods, while S. 3644 suggested no funding for HOPE VI but $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The House Financial Services Committee discussed the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative in March 2010 and ordered the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) in July 2010, which included authorization for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. In March 2010, the House Financial Services Committee discussed the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. In July 2010, they ordered the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) which included authorization for the initiative. The final FY2011 funding law provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI, with a $65 million set-aside from FY2010. This funding may be used for Choice Neighborhoods in FY2011. Congress also authorized the creation of a national Housing Trust Fund in 2008. The Housing Trust Fund, created in 2008, aims to provide a dedicated funding source for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was initially designated for the Trust Fund but was suspended in 2008 due to financial difficulties. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008 to support affordable housing for low-income families, had its funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suspended in 2008 due to financial issues. Despite provisions allowing for alternative funding sources, no money has been directed to the fund yet. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund, with the funding to be offset elsewhere in the budget. No funding has been directed to the Housing Trust Fund despite requests in the President's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets. Congress did not provide any funding in the FY2010 appropriations law, and subsequent laws also did not include funding for the Housing Trust Fund. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aimed to provide funding but were not enacted before adjournment. The FY2011 appropriations law did not include funding for the Housing Trust Fund. Despite legislative proposals in the 111th Congress, no funding has been provided to date. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Funding for the initiative includes appropriations to reduce mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer up to 1% from most accounts. The fund can be used for research, evaluation, program metrics, demonstrations, technical assistance, capacity building, and information technology. In FY2010, Congress approved a $20 million appropriation for combating mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority, resulting in $239 million for the fund. In FY2011, the President requested another $20 million for mortgage fraud and a broader 1% transfer authority. In FY2010, the fund received $239 million due to restricted transfer authority. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, potentially totaling $470 million. However, proposed bills limited the total funding available from transfers to less than half of the requested amount. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress proposed limits on the department's discretion by giving directions on fund allocation. The Transformation Initiative funds were limited to core Department needs, with emphasis on oversight of funding. The Committee limited the use of Transformation Initiative funds to core Department needs and emphasized oversight. Funding for IT modernization and technical assistance was recommended, with restrictions on fund transfers. The final FY2011 appropriations law included $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updating computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) included $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updating computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program, with limited transfer authority under the Transformation Initiative. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs, with a more limited number of accounts than requested by the President. The budget proposed funding CDBG at its FY2010 level, eliminating funding for certain programs, and introducing new initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse. Additionally, the budget aimed to revamp programs like the University Community Fund and the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed funding reductions for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to allocate funds to new initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a $70 million reduction in CDF activities by defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants. The savings would have been used for new initiatives like the Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and Catalytic Investments Competition Grants. The budget also did not request new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing duplication with other federal programs. The President's budget did not request new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing duplication with other federal programs. The House and Senate bills recommended appropriations for CDF activities, including funding for congressional earmarked projects for Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including funding for EDI and NI congressional earmarked projects. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, which is 21.2% less than the previous year's funding. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, a 21.2% decrease from FY2010. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the SCI grant program by 33%. The BEDI program was not funded. The CDF supports activities through the CDBG program and other community development-related programs. The CDF account, funded at $3.501 billion in FY2011, saw a 21.2% decrease from FY2010. CDBG formula grants were reduced by 16.4%, and the SCI grant program by 33%. The BEDI program was not funded. The CDF supports activities through the CDBG program and other community development-related programs, including EDI and NI programs. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, funded at over $3.9 billion in FY2010, is a major source of federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. CDBG funds are allocated to various communities and states to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, address slums or blight, and ensure public health and safety. The Administration proposed maintaining funding levels for FY2011, with additional funding for Sustainable Communities Initiatives. The Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG formula-based component of the program at its FY2010 level of over $3.9 billion for FY2011. Additional funding was allocated for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and Indian tribes, among others. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed modestly higher funding for the CDBG formula grant program compared to the President's request and FY2010 levels. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing CDF account funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. Funds were prohibited for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program components were not included. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced CDF account funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels, prohibiting funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program components were not included, leading to uncertainty in fund distribution among states, entitlement communities, insular areas, Indian tribes, and Puerto Rico. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The law also included a 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer from designated HUD funds to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This resulted in a reduction of $7 million in the CDF account and a transfer of $35 million to the Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative. The across-the-board cut reduces the CDF account by $7 million to $3.501 billion, with a 1% discretionary transfer moving $35 million to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative supporting economic development projects in distressed areas through the proposed Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs). Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to various entities for reclaiming vacant property for green reuse. The Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCG) would have awarded funds competitively to entities for reclaiming vacant property for green reuse and economic development projects. However, no funding was allocated for this program in the House-passed or Senate Committee-passed bills, nor in the final FY2011 appropriations law. The Administration had requested $148.5 million for this initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for its Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to assist small- and medium-sized businesses in targeted neighborhoods and cover administrative costs. Neither the House-passed nor the Senate Committee-passed bills included funding for the program in FY2011. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) requested $100 million in FY2011 for Regional Integrated Planning Grants to support metropolitan areas in developing sustainable community models. Grants range from $500,000 to $3 million for housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning activities. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) requested $100 million in FY2011 for Regional Integrated Planning Grants to support metropolitan areas in developing sustainable community models. Grants range from $500,000 to $3 million for housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning activities. Additionally, Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded to communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. HUD proposed grant awards not to exceed $2 million, with $40 million appropriated in FY2010. HUD has proposed grant awards not exceeding $2 million for the Community Challenge Grants (CCGs). The Administration requested an unspecified amount for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative in FY2011 to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs. Additionally, capacity building is proposed as a new component of the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI). The Administration proposed capacity building as a new component of the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to improve technical capacity. Funding for the SCI at $148.5 million was proposed by both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644, with a requirement of $25 million for the Regional Integrated Planning Grant. Administered through the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD, these initiatives aim to support research efforts and enhance the capabilities of various organizations and sectors. The Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD will administer four initiatives proposed in H.R. 5850 and S. 3644, maintaining funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative at $148.5 million. $25 million is designated for Regional Integrated Planning Grants, with a focus on metropolitan areas under 500,000 population. Additionally, $25 million is allocated for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist various organizations in addressing housing and poverty-related issues, including $5 million for rural Indian tribes. The bills allocated $5 million for rural Indian tribes to address housing and poverty-related issues. They also supported HUD's Transformation Initiative and prohibited the use of Community Development Fund dollars for SCI activities. However, P.L. 112-10 appropriated $99.8 million for SCI activities, representing a 33% reduction from FY2010 funding levels. The FY2011 funding level for SCI activities saw a 33% reduction from FY2010. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling. The Administration proposed doubling the Section 108 loan guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 to help local governments finance projects. They also suggested charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed increasing the Section 108 loan guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 and charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers. Congress rejected this proposal and recommended continuing the program as is, with H.R. 5850 suggesting a $427 million loan commitment ceiling and S. 3644 suggesting $275 million. P.L. 112-10 maintained the program at a $275 million commitment level. The Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program had a commitment ceiling of $275 million supported by a credit subsidy of $5.988 million in FY2011. The program was proposed to be redesigned to provide technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries. The Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program provides technical assistance and funds to local organizations through national intermediaries. The program supports training, education, grants, loans, and financial assistance for community development and affordable housing activities. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for capacity building by $10 million. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for capacity building by $10 million, from $50 million to $60 million. Grant funds would have been competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development to assist CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments in developing capacity for community development and affordable housing. The proposal aimed to provide technical and financial assistance through intermediaries to assist CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments in developing capacity for community development and affordable housing activities. Successful grantees would need to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The proposal aimed to provide technical and financial assistance to local governments for capacity building activities. Grantees were required to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. Funding for this initiative was not included in the House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills. Capacity building activities were recommended to be continued through existing programs like the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program. The Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account funds capacity building through SHOP, providing grants for self-help homeownership opportunities. HUD grants support national and regional organizations for home construction with sweat equity. Additionally, the account funds the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The SHOP account funds capacity building for self-help homeownership opportunities through sweat equity. It also supports the Housing Assistance Council's activities to address rural housing needs. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, as all activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, as activities funded through SHOP are eligible for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. However, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed $82 million for the SHOP account, including $27 million for SHOP and $50 million for capacity building. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed $82 million for the SHOP account, with $27 million for SHOP itself and $50 million for capacity building activities. The final FY2011 appropriations law continued funding for these activities at the FY2010 levels, totaling $81.8 million for account activities. Total FY2011 funding for account activities was $81.8 million, including $26.9 million for SHOP, $49.9 million for Section 4 Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing, and $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council. HUD also anticipated transferring $818,360 to the department's Transformation Initiative account. Through its Housing Counseling Assistance Program, HUD provides grants to approved housing counseling agencies for various services. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program under HUD provides grants to approved agencies for various housing counseling services, including pre-purchase and post-purchase homeownership counseling, mortgage delinquency counseling, and counseling for renters, the homeless, or seniors seeking reverse mortgages. Funding for the program has increased in recent years due to concerns about rising mortgage default and foreclosure rates. Funding rose from $39 million to $87.5 million between FY2003 and FY2010. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program funding increased from $39 million to $87.5 million between FY2003 and FY2010. In FY2011, the President requested $88 million for the program. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 5850 included $88 million, while S. 3644 proposed $100 million. In FY2011, the Housing Counseling Assistance Program funding was eliminated, resulting in an $87.5 million decrease from FY2010 and an $88 million decrease from the President's budget request. Some argue that HUD housing counseling funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program funding. In FY2011, HUD housing counseling funding was criticized for being duplicative of the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program funding. Congress has allocated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America since FY2008, instead of giving it to HUD. Since FY2008, Congress has allocated additional foreclosure mitigation funding to NeighborWorks America instead of HUD. This funding, known as the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), is separate from HUD's budget and is used for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities. In FY2008, NeighborWorks received $180 million specifically for these activities, which was 50% more than its regular annual appropriation. NeighborWorks received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities, which was 50% more than its regular annual appropriation. Funding for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) has varied since then, with the President's budget requesting $113 million in FY2011. Congress allocated $113 million in H.R. 5850, while S. 3644 included $125 million for the NFMCP. The President's budget requested $113 million for the NFMCP in FY2011, which was above the FY2010 appropriation. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $113 million and $125 million for the NFMCP, respectively. The final FY2011 appropriations law maintained funding for the NFMCP at the FY2010 level of $65 million. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the NFMCP at the FY2010 level of $65 million. Housing counseling agencies support the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) by providing counseling to eligible troubled borrowers. Recipients of NFMCP funding can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. The NFMCP provides funding for housing counseling agencies to support troubled borrowers, including those eligible for HAMP. Recipients of NFMCP grants can use up to 30% of the funding to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. Housing counseling agencies also assist borrowers who may be eligible for HAMP. Native American Housing Block Grants are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance primarily to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. In FY2010, Congress provided $700 million for the NAHBG account, with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget request included $580 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, a decrease of $120 million. In FY2010, $700 million was allocated for Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget requested $580 million for NAHBGs, a $120 million decrease. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided nearly $650 million for NAHBGs. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated nearly $650 million for Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs), which was over $50 million less than the FY2010 level but almost $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 request. The law also maintained set-asides at FY2010 levels, with a slight reduction due to an across-the-board rescission. The FY2011 Budget Resolution set spending and revenue parameters for Congress, providing allocations to House and Senate committees for appropriations bills. Committees received information from the executive branch and began consideration after receiving the President's budget. The House and Senate budget committees divide their allocation among 12 subcommittees responsible for appropriations bills. They receive information from various sources to formulate the budget resolution, with a target completion date of April 15. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011, but no further action was taken. The House did not report a budget resolution, leading to different proceedings in the House and Senate. On April 22, 2010, the Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011 (S.Con.Res. 60), but no further action was taken. The House did not report an FY2011 budget resolution. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution (H.Res. 1493) on July 1, 2010, establishing spending levels for the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate did not agree to enforceable spending allocations but provided subcommittee spending guidance for FY2011 appropriations bills. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included $1 billion in funding for the Community Development Fund for a third round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program grants. The funds will be available starting October 1, 2010, considered as FY2011 funds. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allocated $1 billion for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, with funds available from October 1, 2010, considered as FY2011 funds. Additionally, HUD was authorized to provide up to $1 billion in mortgage assistance through the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program for homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. HUD allocated $1 billion for the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP) to assist homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. Additionally, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provided $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 to May 2010. The Community Development Fund allocated CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March to May 2010. This emergency funding was provided in FY2010.
