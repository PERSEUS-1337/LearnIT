    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reexamining the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A diverse group of families and individuals are affected by poverty in the United States. In 2015, a report provided a snapshot of poverty in the United States, showing that those in poverty are a diverse group of families and individuals at different life stages and circumstances. The report focuses on the role of work in the lives of the poor, highlighting how income from work impacts economic well-being for working-age adults, children, and the elderly. Attention is also given to living arrangements as poverty is measured at the family level. The report on poverty in the United States highlights the impact of work on economic well-being for different age groups and living arrangements. It focuses on the composition of people in poverty rather than poverty rates among different groups, providing a unique perspective on the issue. This snapshot focuses on the composition of people in poverty, looking at what groups make up the poverty population rather than poverty rates among different groups. It highlights how different population sizes can affect the share of the poverty population, providing valuable insights for public policy. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, with different demographic groups experiencing varying poverty rates. The size of a population, such as American Indians, can impact the share of the poverty population. The official measure of poverty used by the U.S. Census Bureau is family-based, where individuals are identified as \"poor\" based on their income and the income of family members they live with. For more information on poverty rates and trends, refer to CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief. The U.S. Census Bureau uses a family-based measure of poverty to identify individuals as \"poor.\" Poverty status is determined by comparing an individual's income with a dollar threshold based on family composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a working-age single person was $12,331. The poverty threshold is based on family composition, with specific dollar amounts for different family sizes. The official poverty measure has limitations, such as not considering taxes, non-cash benefits, or assets. The official poverty measure has limitations as it only looks at pre-tax money income and does not consider the impact of taxes, non-cash benefits, or assets. It also does not account for differences in living costs across geographical areas or modern resource-sharing arrangements. The Census Bureau has introduced a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) that takes these factors into account for research purposes. The Census Bureau introduced a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) that considers taxes, transfers, housing costs, and an expanded definition of family. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold, accounting for 13.5% of the population. There is a focus on \"deep poverty,\" with attention on those with income below 50% of the poverty threshold. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. This accounted for close to half of all individuals in poverty. The population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. One-third of all people in poverty were children under 18, working-age adults aged 18-64, and the aged 65 and older. In 2015, the population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. One-third of all people in poverty were children under 18, working-age adults aged 18-64, and the aged 65 and older. Children were over-represented among people in poverty, making up 33.6% compared to 23.1% of the overall population. Working-age adults made up the largest share of the population in poverty, while those aged 65 and older were underrepresented. In 2015, the population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Children were over-represented among people in poverty, making up 33.6% compared to 23.1% of the overall population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group overall (61.4% of the total population) and represented the largest group within the poverty population (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group in the total population (17.8%) and represented 28.1% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations. In 2015, the population in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Children were over-represented among people in poverty, making up 33.6% compared to 23.1% of the overall population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group overall (61.4% of the total population) and represented the largest group within the poverty population (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group in the total population (17.8%) and represented 28.1% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, with most minority groups being over-represented in the poverty population. In 2015, the population in poverty was diverse in terms of age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Children were over-represented in poverty, with Hispanic children making up the largest share. Women slightly outnumbered men in the overall population, but women represented a larger share in the poverty population. Minority groups were over-represented in poverty across all age groups. Hispanic children were the largest group in poverty (36.3%), while non-Hispanic white children made up the largest share overall (51.4%). Women, accounting for 51% of the total population, represented an even larger share in poverty (55.9%). This disparity may be due to women heading more single-parent households, which are more likely to be poor. Men earn more on average, contributing to the gender poverty gap. Poverty has different implications for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents and not expected to support themselves economically. Earnings are higher for men than women on average, even when accounting for full-time year-round employment. Poverty has different implications for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents, while working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves and their children. Aged adults may retire and draw income from benefits based on past work. The report separately explores poverty among these three groups. The report highlights the central role of work as the primary means of economic support for individuals and families, whether through one's own work, parental or family work, or past work providing retirement income. It also explores living arrangements as an important factor in economic well-being. Children accounted for one-third of all people in poverty in America in 2015, despite making up less than a quarter of the total population. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, which is often from earnings. The number of adult workers in the family can exceed two, including all adults in the family. In 2015, the majority of children in the total population lived in families with at least one adult earner, with over 50% in families with two or more earners. Among children who were poor, two-thirds lived in families with earners, but only 10.5% had two or more earners, while 32.1% had no income from earnings. In 2015, a majority of children in poor families lived with one earner, while only 10.5% had two or more earners. Children in female-headed families made up 54.1% of all poor children, a higher proportion than in the total population. Married couple families accounted for one-third of all poor children. In 2015, children in female-headed families made up the majority (54.1%) of all poor children, while children in married couple families accounted for one-third (33%) of poor children. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married couple families, their large population size meant a significant number of poor children lived in this family type. Married-couple families were under-represented among children in poverty compared to the overall population. Poor children were more likely to live in larger families, requiring more income to meet their needs. In 2015, a substantial number of poor children lived in female-headed families, while married-couple families were under-represented among children in poverty. Poor children were more likely to live in larger families, which require higher income thresholds. Larger families are more likely to be poor due to earnings being determined by the labor market, not family size. In 2015, a significant portion of poor children lived in female-headed families, with larger families more likely to be poor. Working-age adults (18-64 years old) represented the majority of people in poverty, with a poverty rate of 12.4%. In 2015, working-age adults (18-64 years old) made up 56.6% of all people in poverty, with a poverty rate of 12.4%. Among poor working-age adults, 61.3% did not have earnings from work, while 38.8% were working in some capacity. Only 10.4% of poor working-age adults worked full-time all year. Among working-age adults who were poor, 38.8% were employed either full- or part-time, full- or part-year. Only 10.4% worked full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness or disability (33%), caregiving (24.3%), schooling (19.4%), retirement (9.0%), and job availability (8.2%). Educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce. Among poor working-age adults, 55.5% had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential, while 25.1% lacked a high school diploma. Higher educational attainment is associated with better job prospects and earnings. Among poor working-age adults, those with a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential make up the largest group (55.5%). Those without a high school diploma account for 25.1% of all poor working-age adults. Even among adults aged 25 to 64, those with only a high school diploma are the largest group among the poor. Family living arrangements are prevalent among both poor and all working-age adults. Among working-age adults, those with only a high school diploma make up the largest share of the poor. Family living arrangements are more common in the overall population than among the poor. A significant portion of poor working-age adults live outside of families, including those living alone or with unrelated adults. Determining the poverty status of these individuals is complex. In 2015, families were disproportionately poor, with 41% of working-age adults in poverty living outside of a family. This group included individuals living alone, with cohabiting partners, or other unrelated adults/roommates. Determining the poverty status of individuals living outside of families is complex, as each person's income is considered separately. Aged adults are the least likely to be living below the poverty line, accounting for 9.7% of the population in poverty with a poverty rate of 8.8% in 2015. In 2015, aged adults accounted for 9.7% of the population in poverty with a poverty rate of 8.8%. Income from past work and other sources plays a key role in their economic well-being. Social Security income is a significant source of support for aged adults. In 2015, Social Security income was received by the families of 62.4% of all aged persons in poverty, compared to 86.0% in the total aged population. Aged adults also receive income from pensions and other benefits earned during their working careers, including private and government pensions. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of aged persons in poverty. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons, with only 11.0% of poor aged persons receiving such earnings. Most aged adults (97.2%) lived in families with income derived from work. In 2015, 97.2% of aged adults lived in families with work-derived income, including Social Security or pension income. Among aged persons in poverty, 71.7% lived in families with work-derived income. Half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a higher rate than the overall population. In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a significantly higher rate than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. This report provides basic information about the 43 million people in America living below the poverty line in 2015, showing they are not a homogenous group. The report in 2015 highlights that individuals living in poverty are not a homogenous group, including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Certain groups like women, minorities, children, and those living alone are over-represented among the impoverished population. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on family members' income, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past earnings. The central role of income from work in determining poverty status is highlighted, with children relying on family members' income, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past earnings. Despite earning income, many individuals still experience poverty, warranting further exploration for federal policy considerations. In 2015, over 70% of elderly individuals living in poverty had some form of work-based income. The complex circumstances leading to poverty require further exploration for effective federal policy interventions."
