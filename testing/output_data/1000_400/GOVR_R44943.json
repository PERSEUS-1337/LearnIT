    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patents involving human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. The courts and USPTO have traditionally interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The USPTO historically allowed a wide range of patentable subject matter under Section 101, but courts have recognized exceptions for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Recent Supreme Court decisions have led to increased use of Section 101 to invalidate patents. The Supreme Court of the United States has issued four opinions since 2010 addressing patentable subject matter, leading to more frequent invalidation of patents under Section 101. This has caused concerns about the U.S. patent system being in a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has sparked debate on its desirability. Concerns have been raised about confusing legal standards established by the Supreme Court, leading to a \"state of crisis\" in the patent system. Some believe these decisions may result in patents of appropriate scope, reduce abusive litigation, and promote higher quality patents. This report reviews current patent law and legislative reform proposals. This report reviews the current law governing patentable subject matter and recent proposals for legislative reform, focusing on the implications of Supreme Court decisions within the information technology and life sciences industries. Individuals and enterprises must submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection, with examiners assessing the merit of the application under the Patent Act of 1952. The report discusses patent acquisition process and legislative reform options in the information technology and life sciences industries. Applicants must submit detailed applications to the USPTO, with examiners evaluating the invention's merit based on patentability criteria. The process, known as \"prosecution,\" involves meeting substantive standards set by the patent statute. The patent acquisition process, known as \"prosecution,\" involves examiners evaluating whether the claimed invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior art, while nonobviousness mandates that the invention is not readily achievable by an ordinary artisan. Additionally, the invention must be useful and provide a tangible benefit. To be patentable, an invention must be novel, nonobvious, and useful. It must not have been readily achievable by an ordinary artisan based on prior art. Section 101 of the Patent Act outlines the categories of patentable subject matter, including processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, and improvements thereof. A process patent claims a series of steps to achieve a specific result, typically related to methods of manufacture or use. It may involve making a product or using a chemical compound for treatment. The other patentable subject matter categories include products like machines and manufactures. The term \"machine\" encompasses mechanical devices to perform functions, while \"manufacture\" refers to the production of goods. The Supreme Court has defined patentable subject matter categories as products like machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. These categories encompass mechanical devices, production of goods, and compositions of substances. The wording of Section 101 is broad, but there are limits on the types of processes that can be patented. The Supreme Court has set limits on patentable subject matter, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. This is to ensure that basic tools of scientific and technological work remain free for all and not reserved exclusively. The USPTO allows patent applications that meet requirements to issue as granted patents, giving the patent holder the right to exclude others from using the invention for twenty years. This exclusivity period allows inventors to practice their inventions or license them to others. The term of a patent is usually set at twenty years from the filing date, providing inventors with limited exclusivity to practice their inventions or license them to others. Patent holders can charge higher prices for their inventions and must monitor competitors for infringement. Litigation in federal courts may be necessary to enforce intellectual property rights, as accused infringers can challenge the validity of a patent. The Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary authority to review cases. Recent decisions have addressed the law of patentable subject matter, with key cases in 1980 and 1981 establishing precedents for patenting genetically engineered microorganisms and processes involving computer technology. The Supreme Court last addressed patentable subject matter nearly four decades ago in Diamond v. Chakrabarty and Diamond v. Diehr, where they ruled in favor of patenting a genetically engineered microorganism and a process involving computer technology. These decisions broadened the range of patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. However, from 2010 to 2014, the Court issued four decisions declaring inventions unpatentable under Section 101, marking a shift in patent eligibility criteria. The Supreme Court revisited patentable subject matter from 2010 to 2014, declaring inventions unpatentable under Section 101. The 2010 decision in Bilski v. Kappos involved a method for managing risk in commodities trading. In 2010, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a method for managing risk in commodities trading. The patent application involved initiating transactions between a commodity provider and consumers based on historical averages to balance risk positions. The USPTO rejected the application. The USPTO rejected a patent application for managing risk in commodities trading, involving transactions between a commodity provider and consumers. The Federal Circuit assessed if the application claimed a fundamental principle or mental process, concluding it did not meet patentable subject criteria under Section 101. The Federal Circuit determined that Bilski's patent application did not qualify as patentable subject matter under Section 101 because it did not involve a specific machine or physical transformation. The Federal Circuit ruled that Bilski's patent application did not meet the requirements for patentable subject matter under Section 101 due to the lack of a physical transformation. The USPTO's decision to deny Bilski's application was upheld, and the Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case, ultimately agreeing that Bilski's invention could not be patented. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case, with a plurality rejecting the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes. Justice Kennedy's opinion stated that Bilski's invention of risk hedging was an abstract idea and not patentable subject matter. Justice Kennedy rejected the idea of patenting risk hedging as it would grant a monopoly over an abstract idea. Justice Stevens concurred, stating that the machine-or-transformation test is reliable but not exclusive. Justice Breyer also concurred, identifying four points of agreement among all nine justices. In a Section 101 case, Justice Breyer emphasized that methods of doing business are not automatically covered by patent law. The machine-or-transformation test is useful but not the only standard for determining patentability. Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. shifted focus to life sciences. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court shifted focus to life sciences by examining patents claiming methods for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases. The patents involve administering a drug to a patient, measuring drug levels in red blood cells, and comparing the results to known levels to adjust dosage accordingly. The patents claim methods of administering a thiopurine drug to a patient and determining drug levels in red blood cells. If levels are outside the known range, dosage adjustments are made to optimize treatment efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders. The Supreme Court ruled that the method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and adjusting dosage based on its levels is unpatentable as it involves natural laws. The Supreme Court concluded that claims involving natural laws, such as optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders, are unpatentable. This decision was based on the principle that monopolizing basic tools through patents could hinder innovation. The Court recognized that while inventions may apply natural laws, processes that apply them in a specific, useful way are eligible for patenting. In this case, the claims were found to recite laws of nature related to the concentration of thiopurine. The Supreme Court ruled that inventions applying natural laws can be patented if they involve specific, useful processes. In the case discussed, the claims included steps beyond just stating natural laws, such as administering a drug and determining metabolite levels. The Court had to determine if these additional steps made the claims eligible for patenting. The Supreme Court ruled that the thiopurine drug case did not qualify as patent-eligible processes, as the additional steps of administering the drug and determining metabolite levels were not enough to make the claims patentable. The Court reasoned that simply limiting the use of natural laws to a specific technological environment did not render the principle patentable. The Supreme Court ruled that the additional steps in the thiopurine drug case, such as administering the drug and determining metabolite levels, were not sufficient to make the claims patentable. Justice Breyer emphasized that simply limiting the use of natural laws to a specific technological environment did not make the principle patentable. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus concluded that advising physicians to consider natural laws in their practices does not make unpatentable laws of nature patentable. The Court rejected the argument that the Prometheus patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test, stating that simply measuring metabolite levels did not transform human blood or the human body. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus rejected the argument that the patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test. Justice Breyer explained that measuring metabolite levels did not transform human blood or the human body. He also clarified that the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability, as it only identified the group of individuals interested in applying the law of nature. The Court addressed the notion that any step beyond stating a law of nature should fulfill Section 101 standards, emphasizing that novelty and nonobviousness are crucial factors in patentability. The Court responded to concerns that rejecting the Prometheus patents would discourage diagnostic research, as patents claiming the body's natural responses to illness could limit physician access to critical scientific data. Justice Breyer emphasized that Section 101 standards are distinct from other patentability requirements. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Products of nature may not be patented, but significant artificial changes can make them patentable. Genomic DNA was deemed ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine, but could be patented if significant artificial changes were made. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, but some experts disagreed with the decision to patent human genes. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, including genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated with cancer predisposition. The decision to patent human genes was challenged in a lawsuit, with experts arguing that isolating genes was a \"technicality\" not eligible for patenting. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad reflected this view. The lawsuit challenged Myriad Genetics' patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with cancer predisposition. The court ruled the gene patents invalid, stating isolated DNA was not significantly different from native DNA. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad Genetics' gene patents, stating that isolated DNA was not markedly different from native DNA. The Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, ruling that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment on Myriad Genetics' gene patents, remanding the case back to the Federal Circuit. Justice Thomas noted that Myriad did not create or alter the genetic information in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but rather discovered their precise location and sequence. The Supreme Court found that Myriad Genetics did not create or alter the genetic information in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but rather discovered their precise location and sequence. The Court was unimpressed with Myriad's claims regarding isolated DNA, stating that it did not involve chemical composition or changes resulting from isolation. However, the Court viewed claims related to complementary DNA more favorably. The Supreme Court found that Myriad Genetics did not create or alter the genetic information in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but rather discovered their precise location and sequence. Justice Thomas stated that Myriad's claims regarding isolated DNA did not involve chemical composition or changes resulting from isolation. However, the Court viewed claims related to complementary DNA more favorably, as cDNA retains naturally occurring exons but is distinct from the DNA it was derived from. Justice Thomas also noted that the Myriad opinion did not implicate innovative gene manipulation methods or new gene applications. Justice Thomas concluded that cDNA could be patented as it is not a \"product of nature.\" The Myriad opinion did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or new gene applications. The Court held that genes and the information they encode are not patent eligible simply because they have been isolated. Seven colleagues joined Justice Thomas's opinion, with Justice Scalia concurring in the judgment. The Supreme Court held that genes and the information they encode are not patent eligible if isolated from surrounding genetic material. Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment, stating that isolated genomic DNA is identical to its natural state, while cDNA can be patented as it is a synthetic creation. In a recent decision, the Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. In Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system designed to mitigate \"settlement risk.\" The inventions included method claims, computer system claims, and computer-readable media claims. The district court ruled the inventions unpatentable as they were deemed to represent a \"basic business or financial concept.\" The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents for computer-implemented inventions were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents for computer-implemented inventions were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying patents claiming laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The Supreme Court established a two-part test to determine patent eligibility for claims involving excluded subject matter. Justice Thomas emphasized the need for an \"inventive concept\" to transform a claim into a patent-eligible application. The Court applied this framework to method claims, identifying them as abstract ideas and assessing for an inventive concept. The Supreme Court applied the two-step test established in Mayo v. Prometheus to determine patent eligibility for method claims. The Court found that the method claims were directed to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement and lacked an inventive concept to transform the idea into a patent-eligible application. Justice Thomas emphasized that simply using a generic computer did not make the claims patentable, as it would allow any abstract principle to become patentable by incorporating computer hardware. The Court rejected the computer system and computer-readable media claims for the same reason. Justice Thomas emphasized that the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot turn an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. The Court rejected computer system and computer-readable media claims for the same reason, as they only included generic computer hardware without adding anything substantial to link the invention to a specific technological environment. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice define the current law on patent eligibility. The courts and USPTO use a two-part test to determine patent eligibility, considering whether a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if the claim includes additional inventive elements. If a claim covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, it cannot be patented under Section 101. The Court analyzes patent claims to determine if they preempt a field of activity, considering if they cover every practical application of a fundamental concept. Recitation of routine hardware does not affect Section 101 eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation. The courts use the machine-or-transformation test as a guidepost for patent eligibility. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation, often without a formal construction of the patent's claims. Statistical analyses show a high probability of invalidating challenged claims, with an average invalidation rate of 66.5%. Based on statistical analyses, courts have examined 568 challenged patents under \u00a7101 motions citing Alice, resulting in a 66.5% invalidation rate. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 published patent applications under Alice, indicating a good chance of success when asserting a patent claim is invalid. Recent statistics show that patents challenged under Section 101 motions citing Alice have a high invalidation rate. This suggests that recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted both information technologies and life sciences. The courts have invalidated numerous patents on computer-related inventions. The recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted information technologies, leading to the invalidation of numerous patents on computer-related inventions. Patent claims that lack specific solutions or improvements in technology are vulnerable to Section 101 challenges. Patent claims invalidated included inventions like a computer system for generating menus, collecting data on an electric power grid, extracting data from hard copy documents, administering life insurance policies, and processing credit applications over electronic networks. The patent invalidated in a representative decision involved a broadcast system allowing out-of-region access to local broadcasts, deemed an abstract idea by the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system that allows out-of-region access to local broadcasts, deeming it an abstract idea. The court found that the patent did not describe how the invention accomplished the claimed functions, focusing solely on the idea itself. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system allowing out-of-region access to local broadcasts, deeming it an abstract idea. Judge Bryson noted that the patent did not describe how the invention achieved the claimed functions, focusing solely on the idea itself. The court concluded that the circumstances did not satisfy Section 101. The Federal Circuit has upheld patents in other cases, such as e-commerce systems, information management systems, and methods of filtering Internet content. The Federal Circuit has upheld patents in cases involving e-commerce systems, information management systems, and methods of filtering Internet content. Claims that avoid broad functional language and recite specific structures are more likely to survive Section 101 challenges. Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had implications for the life sciences industry, particularly regarding predictive diagnostic methods and biomarker-related patents. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have impacted the life sciences industry, especially in terms of patentability of predictive diagnostic methods and biomarkers. The Myriad case has raised doubts on patenting isolated bodily substances like genes, proteins, and cell lines. The Federal Circuit ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. has sparked significant discussion within the patent community, particularly regarding non-invasive prenatal diagnostic methods. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed Section 101 in life sciences compared to information technologies. The 2015 Federal Circuit ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. involved a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method for detecting fetal genetic disorders. Sequenom held the exclusive license for U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540, which included a method for detecting paternally inherited nucleic acid in maternal serum samples. The Federal Circuit ruled that a patent claiming a method for detecting paternally inherited fetal DNA in maternal serum failed the patentable subject matter test as it was directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon and involved conventional techniques. The Federal Circuit ruled that a patent claiming a method for detecting paternally inherited fetal DNA in maternal serum failed the patentable subject matter test as it was directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon and involved conventional techniques. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the breakthrough nature of the invention in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Judge Linn disagreed with the ruling that a patent for detecting fetal DNA in maternal serum was invalid, stating that the invention was groundbreaking for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Congress has options to address patentable subject matter laws, with industry associations suggesting changes to Section 101. No bills have been introduced on this issue since 2011. Since the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011, industry associations have proposed modifications to Section 101 regarding patentable subject matter. The American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) have similar proposals to replace the existing language with more specific criteria for patent eligibility. The American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Intellectual Property Law also has a proposal for modifications to Section 101 regarding patentable subject matter, similar to the proposals from AIPLA and IPO. The proposal focuses on specific criteria for patent eligibility without considering other patent requirements. The American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Intellectual Property Law has proposed amendments to Section 101 for patent eligibility, focusing on specific criteria without considering other patent requirements. The American Bar Association's proposed amendments to Section 101 for patent eligibility focus on specific criteria for obtaining a patent on inventions or discoveries, with exceptions for claims that preempt the use of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. Patent eligibility is maintained when practical applications are considered in the claims as a whole. The AIPLA and ABA Section on Intellectual Property argue that patent eligibility under Section 101 should focus on practical applications of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas, without being negated by considerations of patentability. They believe recent Supreme Court decisions have introduced ambiguity into the eligibility determination process. The AIPLA, ABA Section on Intellectual Property, and IPO criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility under Section 101, arguing that it should focus on practical applications without being overshadowed by patentability considerations. They believe the Court's criteria like 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious' are inappropriate and turn patent eligibility into a patentability test, contrary to congressional intent. The IPO criticizes the Supreme Court's analysis of patent eligibility, calling it too restrictive and contrary to congressional intent. Some believe that legislative reform is unnecessary, as restrictive rules have not impacted innovation or investment. Proposed amendments could potentially eliminate constraints on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. Proposed amendments could potentially eliminate constraints on software patenting and subject matter eligibility, sparking a heated debate among knowledgeable observers. The recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter, particularly in software and life sciences fields, has sparked a heated debate among experts. While some believe Section 101 maintains a balance between innovation and patent rights, others fear that limited patent availability may hinder innovation and investment in the US. These debates may lead to further exploration of what types of inventions should be patentable."
