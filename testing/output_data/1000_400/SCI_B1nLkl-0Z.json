    "content": "State-action value functions, such as Q-values, are essential in reinforcement learning algorithms like SARSA and Q-learning. A new concept of action value, defined by a Gaussian smoothed version of expected Q-value, is proposed. These smoothed Q-values still adhere to a Bellman equation, making them learnable from experience. Gradients of expected reward can be derived from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function, enabling the development of new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned Q-value approximator. This approach allows for learning both mean and covariance during training, enhancing its effectiveness. The approach introduces new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned Q-value function, allowing for learning both mean and covariance during training. This method achieves strong results on continuous control benchmarks by updating the policy to maximize the current value function. In reinforcement learning, different notions of Q-value lead to distinct families of methods. SARSA uses expected Q-value, Q-learning uses a hard-max Q-value, while Soft Q-learning and PCL use a soft-max Q-value. The choice of Q-value function significantly impacts the resulting algorithm by restricting policy types and exploration methods. In this work, a new notion of action value called the smoothed action value function Q \u03c0 is introduced. Unlike previous notions, the smoothed Q-value associates a value with a distribution over actions rather than a specific action at each state. It is defined as the expected return of first taking an action sampled from a normal distribution centered at a, then following actions sampled from the current policy thereafter. This allows for interpretation as a Gaussian-smoothed or noisy Q-value. The smoothed Q-value is a value associated with a distribution over actions, defined as the expected return of taking an action sampled from a normal distribution centered at a, then following actions from the current policy. It possesses properties that make it useful for RL algorithms, such as satisfying single-step Bellman consistency and allowing for bootstrapping with function approximators. For Gaussian policies, the optimization objective can be expressed in terms of smoothed Q-values. Smoothie is an algorithm that trains a policy using derivatives of a trained Q-value function, avoiding high variance in standard policy gradient algorithms like DDPG. Unlike DDPG, Smoothie addresses poor exploratory behavior and utilizes smoothed Q-values for optimization. Smoothie algorithm, inspired by DDPG, trains a policy using derivatives of a smoothed Q-value function to avoid high variance in standard policy gradient algorithms. It incorporates a non-deterministic Gaussian policy for better exploration and can easily incorporate proximal policy optimization techniques by penalizing KL-divergence. Smoothie algorithm, based on DDPG, reduces variance in policy gradient algorithms by using smoothed Q-value derivatives. It includes a Gaussian policy for exploration and can integrate KL-divergence penalties for improved stability and performance in continuous control benchmarks. The standard model-free RL framework involves an agent interacting with a stochastic environment to maximize cumulative discounted reward. This is done through a Markov decision process with state and action spaces, where the agent's behavior is modeled using a stochastic policy. The optimization objective is the expected discounted return expressed in terms of the expected action value function Q\u03c0(s, a). The agent's behavior is modeled using a stochastic policy \u03c0 that produces a distribution over feasible actions at each state s. The optimization objective is the expected discounted return expressed in terms of the expected action value function Q\u03c0(s, a). The policy gradient theorem expresses the gradient of OER(\u03c0\u03b8) with respect to the tunable parameters of a policy \u03c0\u03b8. Many reinforcement learning algorithms trade off variance and bias when estimating. The policy gradient theorem expresses the gradient of OER(\u03c0\u03b8) with respect to the tunable parameters of a policy \u03c0\u03b8. Reinforcement learning algorithms trade off variance and bias when estimating the random variable inside the expectation. Multivariate Gaussian policies are focused on for continuous action spaces. In this paper, new RL training methods are developed for multivariate Gaussian policies over continuous action spaces. The policies are parametrized by mean and covariance functions, mapping the observed state to a Gaussian distribution. The focus is on accumulating discounted rewards using a single Monte Carlo sample. The policy gradient theorem is mentioned, along with prior work on learning Gaussian policies. The formulation of the policy gradient for Gaussian policies is discussed, focusing on the deterministic policy gradient when the policy covariance approaches zero. The expected future return from a state is estimated under a deterministic policy, and the optimization objective gradient is expressed for a parameterized policy. The Bellman equation is re-expressed in the limit of the policy covariance approaching zero. The policy gradient theorem for deterministic policies is characterized by expressing the gradient of the optimization objective for a parameterized policy. The Bellman equation can be re-expressed as a value function approximator is optimized by minimizing the Bellman error. Algorithms like DDPG alternate between improving the value function and the policy. Off-policy distributions are used to improve sample efficiency in practice. In this paper, smoothed action value functions are introduced to optimize Gaussian policy parameters. Smoothed Q-values, denoted Q \u03c0 (s, a), do not assume the first action is fully specified, but rather only the mean of the distribution is known. This approach improves sample efficiency by using off-policy data. Smoothed Q-values, denoted Q \u03c0 (s, a), do not assume the first action is fully specified, but rather only the mean of the distribution is known. This approach improves sample efficiency by using off-policy data. The key insight is to directly learn a function approximator for Q \u03c0 (s, a) instead of drawing samples to approximate the expectation. The approach involves directly learning a function approximator for smoothed Q-values under a Gaussian policy, enabling Bellman consistency and direct optimization of Q \u03c0. By combining formulas, one can derive a Bellman equation for smoothed Q-values under a Gaussian policy. The gradient of the objective with respect to mean parameters follows the policy gradient theorem. Estimating the derivative of the objective with respect to covariance parameters is more complex, but the second derivative of Q \u03c0 with respect to actions allows for the computation of the derivative with respect to \u03a3. Estimating the derivative of the objective with respect to covariance parameters is not straightforward, but the second derivative of Q \u03c0 with respect to actions allows for the computation of the derivative with respect to \u03a3. The full derivative with respect to \u03c6 can be optimized in two ways for Q 2. The training procedure for Q \u03c0 w (s, a) involves using a target network and a single function approximator, optimizing by minimizing a weighted Bellman error. Sampling from a replay buffer with a phantom action allows for achieving a fixed point in the Bellman equation. When training Q \u03c0 w (s, a), a phantom action is drawn from a distribution, optimizing by minimizing a weighted Bellman error. The training procedure reaches an optimum when Q \u03c0 w (s, a) satisfies the Bellman equation recursion, without needing to track probabilities of actions. Other works have also benefited from ignoring importance weights. The curr_chunk discusses the use of trust region methods and penalty on KL-divergence to stabilize policy gradient algorithms in continuous control problems. These techniques have not been applicable to deterministic policies like DDPG. The formulation proposed in this paper introduces trust region optimization for stabilizing policy gradient algorithms in continuous control problems. This approach includes augmenting the objective with a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy parameterization, allowing for straightforward optimization due to the analytical expression of the KL-divergence of two Gaussians. This work builds on previous research using Q-value functions to learn a stable policy, which has been used to approximate expected or optimal future value.

It builds on previous work using Q-value functions to learn a stable policy, similar to methods that exploit gradient information to train a policy, such as deterministic policy gradient. The proposed method can be seen as a generalization of deterministic policy gradient, with updates for training the Q-value approximator and policy mean being identical when the policy covariance approaches zero.

It is a generalization of deterministic policy gradient, with updates for training the Q-value approximator and policy mean being identical when the policy covariance approaches zero. The key differences with other approaches like Stochastic Value Gradient (SVG) are that SVG does not provide an update for the covariance, and the mean update in SVG estimates the gradient with a noisy Monte Carlo sample, which is avoided by estimating the smoothed Q-value function.

It is a generalization of deterministic policy gradient, with updates for training the Q-value approximator and policy mean being identical when the policy covariance approaches zero. The novel training scheme for learning the covariance of a Gaussian policy relies on properties of Gaussian integrals. The perspective presented in this paper focuses on Q-values representing the averaged return of a distribution of actions, distinct from recent advances in distributional RL. An interesting topic for further investigation is studying the applicability of this new perspective to a wider class of policy distributions. The insights from Section 3 are utilized to introduce a new RL algorithm, Smoothie.

It focuses on Q-values representing the averaged return of a distribution of actions and introduces a new RL algorithm, Smoothie, utilizing insights from Section 3. Smoothie maintains a parameterized Q \u03c0 w and trains a Gaussian policy \u00b5 \u03b8 , \u03a3 \u03c6 using gradient and Hessian updates.

It maintains a parameterized Q \u03c0 w and trains a Gaussian policy \u00b5 \u03b8 , \u03a3 \u03c6 using gradient and Hessian updates. The algorithm is evaluated against DDPG on a simple synthetic task to study its behavior in a restricted setting. Smoothie, a Q-value approximator, is compared to DDPG on a simple synthetic task with a reward function of two Gaussians. Smoothie learns both mean and variance, while DDPG only learns the mean. DDPG struggles to escape local optima. Smoothie learns both mean and variance, while DDPG only learns the mean. DDPG struggles to escape local optima due to issues with updating the mean, while Smoothie successfully solves the task by adjusting towards the better Gaussian. Smoothie successfully solves the task by adjusting towards the better Gaussian, with the smoothed reward function guiding \u00b5 \u03b8. The covariance \u03a3 \u03c6 is suitably adjusted during training, decreasing initially and then increasing before decreasing again as \u00b5 \u03b8 approaches the global optimum. Smoothie can escape local optima, unlike DDPG which struggles with updating the mean. Smoothie successfully adjusts its policy variance to escape lower-reward local optima and adapt to changes in the reward function's convexity/concavity. In contrast, DDPG maintains a constant exploratory noise level during training. Implementation details for both algorithms, including the use of feed-forward neural networks and parameterization of covariance, are provided. Smoothie is competitive with DDPG in continuous control benchmarks on OpenAI Gym using feed forward neural networks for policy and Q-values. It learns the optimal noise scale during training and outperforms DDPG in final reward performance, especially in difficult tasks like Hopper, Walker2d, and Humanoid. TRPO is not sample-efficient enough to be a competitive baseline. Smoothie and DDPG are compared in continuous control benchmarks on OpenAI Gym.

The results for Humanoid are particularly impressive, achieving the best published results with only millions of environment steps. Smoothie's use of a learnable covariance and KL-penalty improves performance, especially on harder tasks. This provides evidence of the benefits of not restricting policies to be deterministic. Smoothie introduces a KL-penalty to improve performance, especially on harder tasks like Hopper and Humanoid. The algorithm addresses the instability in DDPG training and presents a new Q-value function, Q \u03c0, which enhances learning by establishing a relationship between the gradient of expected reward and the Gaussian policy's mean and covariance. Smoothie introduces a new Q-value function, Q \u03c0, which smooths the true reward surface, making it easier to learn. The algorithm successfully learns both mean and covariance during training, matching or surpassing DDPG performance, especially with a penalty on policy divergence. Learning Q \u03c0 is deemed more sensible than Q \u03c0, as it has a direct relationship with the expected discounted return objective. Future work should explore these claims and techniques further. The smoothed Q-values of Q \u03c0 make the reward surface smoother and easier to learn, with a direct relationship to the expected discounted return objective. Future work should investigate these claims and apply the underlying motivations to other policies. The specific identity mentioned can be derived using standard matrix calculus."
