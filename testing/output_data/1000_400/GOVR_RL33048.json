    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. Congress focuses on the security of hazardous chemicals in transportation and storage facilities to reduce the risk of exploitation by terrorists. In response to the security concerns post-9/11, Congress is reviewing federal policies on hazardous chemical transportation by rail, truck, and marine vessels. Legislation such as H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 aim to increase penalties for criminal activities around ports and enhance general port security. Congress is expected to seek a broader understanding of hazardous chemical marine shipments and their security measures. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on risks in the homeland security context. It includes federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments, relevant U.S. maritime security regulations, and security policy issues associated with these shipments. The report focuses on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, detailing shipment volumes and port locations. It discusses security policy issues, risk uncertainties, resources, and effectiveness. The report addresses acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public, excluding other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report focuses on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, detailing shipment volumes and port locations. It discusses security policy issues, risk uncertainties, resources, and effectiveness. The report addresses acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public, excluding other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report does not provide detailed statistics for specific hazardous chemicals or ports of interest due to legal limitations on proprietary shipping data. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo are potential terrorist targets due to their acute toxicity and combustibility, posing a serious threat to human life. The report highlights the importance of protecting hazardous chemical shipments in U.S. waters as they are potential terrorist targets due to their acute toxicity and combustibility. These shipments are considered critical infrastructures and are part of the homeland security strategy. Despite being attractive targets, no terrorist attacks using marine vessels carrying hazardous chemicals have occurred. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments in U.S. waterways is crucial for homeland security. While no terrorist attacks using marine vessels carrying hazardous chemicals have occurred, accidents have shown the potential impact on nearby communities. Intelligence suggests terrorists may have the capability and interest in executing such attacks in the U.S. Major accidents involving hazardous chemical transportation are rare but have been some of the deadliest industrial accidents ever. Major accidents involving hazardous chemicals in marine transportation are uncommon but have been some of the deadliest industrial accidents ever recorded. For example, the explosion of the Mont-Blanc in 1917 killed over 1,900 people in Halifax, and the 1947 Texas City disaster killed nearly 600 people. Improved safety practices have prevented similar disasters in the past 60 years. The Texas City disaster in 1947, involving two cargo ships carrying hazardous chemicals, killed nearly 600 people and injured 3,500. Since then, there have been other incidents involving chemical marine shipments, such as fires and accidents, but improved safety practices have prevented similar catastrophic events in the past 60 years. Incidents involving hazardous chemical marine shipments have occurred in the past, including a fire aboard the Cason and Multitank Ascania. While no serious casualties occurred, emergency responders were concerned for public safety. Terrorists have attempted to release chemicals from land-based facilities, but there have been no chemical attacks using marine cargo vessels on the general public. During the 1990s, there were attempts to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities in foreign war zones and the United States. Terrorists targeted marine vessels to destroy them or their cargo, with incidents like the foiled Al-Qaeda plot in June 2002. Terrorists have targeted marine vessels, including a successful attack on the oil tanker Limburg off the Yemeni coast. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about the security of chemical infrastructure, including chemical tanker ships. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about the security of chemical tanker ships, including the risks associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments. LNG tankers have been identified as potential terrorist targets due to the high consequence cargo they carry. The Department of Homeland Security has identified liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers as potential terrorist targets due to the high consequence cargo they carry. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real and can never be entirely eliminated, according to a 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories. Various potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers, such as ramming, pre-placed explosives, insider takeover, hijacking, or external actions like missile or airplane attacks, have been considered credible and possible. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) focuses on terrorist attacks involving hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels that could pose catastrophic hazards to the public, including poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, or thermal burns. Federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals for public security. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. Hazardous materials are defined and classified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, with thousands of materials listed, including toxic and radioactive substances. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate hazardous materials that pose risks when transported. The DOT classifies materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, grouping them by type of hazard. Shippers of \"highly hazardous\" cargo must develop security plans under 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.8. The DOT ranks hazardous materials by class in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.2a and requires security plans for \"highly hazardous\" cargo in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.8. Highly hazardous cargo includes radioactive materials, explosives over 55 pounds, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous materials, CDC-regulated agents, and other materials requiring placarding. The Coast Guard regulates hazardous materials on marine vessels, including bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous materials, CDC-regulated agents, and materials requiring placarding. The definition of \"certain dangerous cargoes\" in Coast Guard regulations refers to the DOT list of hazardous materials. The Coast Guard regulates hazardous materials on marine vessels, including bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, and packaged hazardous materials. Hazardous cargoes are identified in various sections of federal code, with specific requirements for vessels carrying different types of hazardous materials. The Coast Guard regulates hazardous materials on marine vessels, including bulk liquids, gases, and solids. Hazardous cargoes are identified in federal code, with specific requirements for vessels carrying different types of hazardous materials. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for facilities with specified threshold quantities of certain hazardous substances. Plans must include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents and measures to prevent releases and mitigate damage. Hazardous substances include listed substances and additional chemicals designated by the EPA. The Clean Air Act requires risk management plans for facilities handling hazardous substances, including off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents. Hazardous substances are defined by the EPA and include listed substances and additional designated chemicals based on risk criteria. EPA's list includes acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids, excluding high explosives and certain flammable substances used as fuel. The EPA promulgated a list of hazardous substances, including acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids. High explosives were removed from the list in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The current EPA/RMP list is provided in Appendix 2. Most hazardous materials on DOT and Coast Guard lists do not pose catastrophic health hazards to the general public due to limited quantities or physical properties. EPA's list identifies chemicals considered to have significant risks. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous substances is more focused on chemicals with potential consequences to the general public, compared to the DOT and Coast Guard lists. These chemicals are considered among the most hazardous on land, indicating they may pose similar risks if transported on water. The EPA/RMP list can be used as a basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most substances also found on the DOT and Coast Guard lists. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous substances, focused on chemicals with potential consequences to the general public, can be used for marine cargo hazard analysis. Most substances on this list are also found on the DOT and Coast Guard lists. Excluding radioactive materials and explosives, which account for less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo, is unlikely to affect policy conclusions. EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous substances focuses on chemicals with potential consequences to the general public and can be used for marine cargo hazard analysis. Excluding explosives and radioactive materials, which make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo, is unlikely to impact policy conclusions. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. Ammonia, for example, is an acutely toxic and potentially explosive gas used in various industries. Ammonia is a toxic and potentially explosive gas used in various industries, including the manufacture of fertilizers. It can cause skin and respiratory irritation, eye corrosion, and fatal lung fluid buildup. Methane, on the other hand, is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation at high concentrations. It is flammable and may freeze body parts upon contact. Methane is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation at high concentrations. It is flammable and may freeze body parts upon contact. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in various industrial products, causing irritation to eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It is highly flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. Uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on exposed populations. Methyloxirane vapor is highly flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. Uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on exposed populations, warranting special regulatory treatment. EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous to the general public. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous to the general public, warranting special regulatory treatment. The list was developed for land facilities, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing their hazard in a marine incident, while others evaporate quickly or float and evaporate faster on water. Certain EPA/RMP chemicals have different characteristics when released over water. Some dissolve or sink in water, reducing their hazard in a marine incident, while others evaporate quickly or float and evaporate faster on water. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. Table 1 summarizes the total U.S. waterborne shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in 2003, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. These chemicals are included on the EPA/RMP list due to their hazardous properties to human health and could pose a catastrophic threat to the public if released in large volumes. In an analysis of marine cargo terrorism hazards, hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are considered due to their chemical properties that are harmful to human health. The overall volume of hazardous materials in a marine shipment is crucial in evaluating potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. Over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways in 2003, with the number of shipments potentially increasing the overall terrorist risk. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways, increasing the overall terrorist risk. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for these chemicals. The data in Figure 1 show the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment. In 2003, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals exceeded the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Each category of chemicals was typically shipped hundreds to thousands of times. The average waterborne shipment of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in 2003 would require an off-site risk management plan if stored on land. Hazardous cargoes are shipped between several hundred and several thousand times, with vessel characteristics playing a key role in security considerations. Cargo vessel characteristics are crucial for security, determining vulnerability to accidents or attacks. In 2003, 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or liquid chemical barges. Liquefied gas tankers are designed for carrying cooled or pressurized gas cargoes. Liquefied gas tankers are oceangoing ships designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia. These tankers have large onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo requirements. International shipping codes set strict standards for their construction and operation. Liquefied gas tankers have onboard tanks for chemicals like chloride, methyl chloride, ammonia, and propylene oxide. These tanks are built to withstand high pressures and low temperatures, making them resistant to impact damage. The vessels are double-hulled, providing greater structural integrity and resistance to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers carry only LNG. Liquefied gas tankers, including LNG tankers, have double-hulled structures for greater structural integrity and resistance to damage. LNG tankers carry only LNG, while other liquefied gas tankers may carry a combination of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. Tanker capacities vary, with fully pressurized ships able to carry up to 4,300m3 of cargo. Liquefied gas carriers, such as LNG tankers, have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity ships. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to transport various liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can have 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and range in total cargo capacity from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. They are governed by international construction standards. A chemical parcel tanker is illustrated with a cutaway view showing individual cargo tanks. These tankers are governed by international construction standards and may have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings to ensure compatibility with a range of chemicals. They have double bottoms or hulls and maintain spaces between tank walls to prevent incompatible cargoes from coming into contact with each other. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and inland. Liquid chemical barges are vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways. They have multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or special coatings and range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Unpowered chemical barges on inland waterways are approximately 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long. Liquid chemical barges can range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Inland barges usually travel in groups of two to eight per towboat, with some linehaul tows consisting of more than 20 barges. These barges may have refrigerated cargo tanks capable of carrying ammonia, propylene, or other refrigerated chemical products. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for pressurized liquid cargoes. Liquid chemical barges can range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity, with some having refrigerated cargo tanks for ammonia, propylene, or other refrigerated chemical products. Hazardous chemicals can also be transported on conventional container ships in various ways. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals may be present in container ships at any time. Container ships can carry hazardous chemicals in tankcontainers, drums, portable tanks, or other cargo consignments. Hazardous chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas aboard these vessels. They may also be transported on general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with hazardous cargo are proportional to volume. Comparing the volume of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo can be informative. Hazardous chemicals are shipped in designated cargo areas on various vessels, including container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, and ferries. The public hazards are proportional to the volume of hazardous chemicals present. Comparing volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels to other transportation modes and land storage facilities is informative. Marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks are all used for transporting hazardous chemicals. Rail tank cars have a cargo capacity range of approximately 50 to 90 tons, depending on the chemicals carried. Highway tanker trucks, rail tank cars, and containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars are bulk transportation modes for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. Rail tank cars have a cargo capacity range of 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Highway tanker trucks carry hazardous cargoes like anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG with a cargo capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons. Table 2 summarizes the typical cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers transporting EPA/RMP chemicals. The cargo tank capacity for tanker trucks transporting EPA/RMP chemicals ranges from 15 to 30 tons. Marine tankers generally have a much larger capacity than rail or highway tankers. Marine tankers often carry partial cargoes, making it difficult to compare actual volumes shipped across different modes. Marine tankers have larger capacities than rail or highway tanker trucks, making it challenging to compare actual volumes shipped across different modes. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities filing risk management plans under the Clean Air Act. Comparisons were made between marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals. Comparisons were made between marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals, including high, medium, and low volume shipments of toxic and flammable chemicals. The average marine shipments for chemicals shipped in higher volumes were generally larger than the average volumes stored at EPA/RMP chemical plants. Table 3 compares marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals either start or end at U.S. ports, with some ports serving as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer. Port facilities play a crucial role in the transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals, with some serving as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer of cargo. These facilities may also receive hazardous cargo directly for industrial processes like petrochemical refining and water treatment. The volume and type of hazardous marine shipments vary across ports, impacting security hazards related to EPA/RMP chemicals. The concentration of EPA/RMP hazardous marine shipments varies across U.S. ports, with the top 30 ports handling 95% of the cargo tonnage. There are over 360 commercial ports in the United States, with 113 ports shipping EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in 2003. In 2003, 113 ports in the United States shipped EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports handling approximately 95% of the cargo tonnage. Additional hazardous marine cargo may also be shipped in large volumes through other ports. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States are spread across 15 states, with over half located in the Gulf of Mexico. These ports handle a significant amount of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with varying types of chemicals being shipped from port to port. The volume of cargo in one port does not correlate with the volume in another port, making each port a potential security concern for hazardous cargo shipments. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States are spread across 15 states, with over half located in the Gulf of Mexico. The mix of principal EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals varies considerably from port to port. The most frequently listed hazardous cargoes are LPG and ammonia. Great Lakes ports are not included in the list. The characteristics of LPG and ammonia were summarized earlier in the report. The list of top 30 ports handling EPA/RMP hazardous cargo in 2003 is derived from estimates of hazardous cargo volumes. Key factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo shipping hazards, marine passenger traffic, hazardous materials sites, proximity to populations, and threat intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program. The Department of Homeland Security considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program, which provides security enhancement grants to U.S. ports. The Coast Guard is responsible for promoting maritime security and inspects commercial ships approaching U.S. waters. The Coast Guard oversees security and safety at ports, tracks commercial ships, and enforces regulations for vessels carrying hazardous cargo. The Coast Guard has a history of special concern for ships and barges carrying hazardous cargo, with safety regulations in place to mitigate damage from accidents and potential terrorist attacks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety and security measures. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has enhanced its maritime security regulations to address terrorism specifically, focusing on port vulnerabilities and deploying resources to prevent terrorist attacks. The Coast Guard has created plans to address vulnerabilities in marine targets, focusing on preventing terrorist attacks and enhancing security of key assets. They have also played a leading role in developing maritime security standards and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. The Coast Guard has been instrumental in developing maritime security standards, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) to ensure safe operations of ships and ports worldwide. The ISPS Code requires security plans for ships and port facilities, with designated security officers and equipment to be deployed under different threat levels. The world implements security plans for ships and ports under three threat levels. Each ship and port must have a designated security officer, deploy security equipment, monitor access, and ensure security communications. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, conducting on-site inspections six months later to ensure compliance. Additionally, security assessments of the nation's vessels have been completed. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, conducting on-site inspections six months later to ensure compliance. They also completed security assessments of the nation's 55 strategic ports and took specific measures to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels. The Coast Guard evaluates the vulnerability of marine tankers and inland barges carrying hazardous chemicals to different types of attacks. They require vessels to report information four days prior to arrival or departure to assess security risks and take necessary actions. The Coast Guard may board vessels and post armed sea-marshals to ensure secure transit. The Coast Guard evaluates potential security risks of vessels entering U.S. waters and takes actions to ensure secure transit, including boarding vessels and posting armed sea-marshals. Ships carrying hazardous cargo may be escorted by patrol boats enforcing a security zone while transiting a harbor. Vessels carrying hazardous cargo may need to provide roving patrols during mooring. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat levels or sensitive harbor areas. The Coast Guard maintains Maritime Safety and Security Teams nationwide for security operations at ports. Vessels in U.S. ports must have AIS transponders for tracking movement. Smaller craft like fishing boats are exempt from this requirement. The Coast Guard is implementing maritime domain awareness efforts by requiring vessels in U.S. ports to have AIS transponders for tracking movement. They are also developing joint harbor operations centers (JHOCs) equipped with various monitoring equipment and intelligence databases. The Coast Guard is establishing Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) in U.S. harbors to track vessel traffic using various equipment and intelligence databases. They are also working on enhancing security measures for merchant mariners and landside workers. The Coast Guard is collaborating with the Transportation Security Administration to improve security for merchant mariners and landside workers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains emergency response capabilities for hazardous material incidents, including the CAMEO program for chemical dispersion. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program for chemical dispersion. This program provides response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals, electronic mapping, and air dispersion models. NOAA has also collaborated with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence on risk assessments for hazardous chemicals at U.S. ports. NOAA has linked its air dispersion models to support emergency planners and first responders, partnering with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals at U.S. ports. They also coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups and the Coast Guard receive input from the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee to promote security of hazardous marine cargo. The Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) provides input to the Coast Guard on hazardous materials regulations, with members from various sectors associated with marine transportation. In 2002, CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators (AWO), a trade association of barge operators, consults with the Coast Guard and Army Corps on industry security measures. In October 2002, CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators (AWO) created a model vessel security plan with the Coast Guard and Army Corps to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. American Chemistry Council has issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy. Congressional attention is needed for policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo. Maritime security of chemical cargo on U.S. waterways and ports is a priority, with policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo needing Congressional attention. Significant concerns include risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness. Terrorism risk is defined by threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with uncertainties existing in all three factors. Debate surrounds the potential threat of terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters since 9/11. The debate over the threat of terrorists targeting hazardous chemical shipping in U.S. waters post-9/11 is fueled by uncertainties in threat intelligence and the shifting goals of potential attackers. Some experts believe public concern is overstated and should not hinder maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping to harm the general population. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and shifting goals of potential attackers raise questions about the basis for conclusions regarding the threat of terrorists targeting hazardous chemical shipping in U.S. waters. Despite Coast Guard activities to assess vulnerabilities, analysts suggest potential uncertainties in assessing the consequences of a terrorist attack on marine cargo vessels. Some analysts suggest potential uncertainties in assessing the consequences of a terrorist attack on marine cargo vessels, particularly hazardous chemical shipping. Recent public controversy surrounds conflicting vulnerability and consequence studies on LNG shipping security. Limited public information is available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks, despite partnerships between NOAA and the Coast Guard for risk assessments at U.S. ports. The security sensitivity of these assessments and plans complicates evaluation efforts. The security sensitivity of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans complicates evaluation efforts due to limited public information on physical vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. Little research is available on intentional release of hazardous chemicals, impacting the effectiveness of maritime security strategy. Vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are crucial for U.S. maritime security strategy, especially for hazardous chemicals carriers. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty can help prioritize security activities. The Coast Guard can enhance port security by receiving timely intelligence information, while security experts can analyze vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. The federal government plays a crucial role in enhancing port security by ensuring timely intelligence information reception and conducting research on vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences. Standard models and methodologies, such as those maintained by NOAA and EPA, are beneficial for such analyses. A federal role is important for methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns about the costs associated with hazardous marine cargo security and potential diversion of resources from other activities have been raised by policymakers and Coast Guard officials. The costs and concerns associated with hazardous marine cargo security have been raised by policymakers and Coast Guard officials. Resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could be used for other missions such as boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. Security activities have significantly increased for the Coast Guard since 9/11, with President Bush requesting $8.1 billion for maritime security expenditures. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security. Hazardous marine cargo security is funded from the general maritime security budget, with an additional $11 million sought for increased operational presence through new small response boats and crew. Cargo security is funded from the Coast Guard's general maritime security budget, with an additional $11 million sought for new response boats and crew. State and local agencies are also seeking more funding for hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers costing up to $80,000 to secure per shipment. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to offset the costs of hazardous marine cargo security, especially for LNG tankers that may cost up to $80,000 to secure per shipment. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover the costs of additional maritime security needed for their facilities, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, the ambiguity in accounting for security costs and reliance on uncertain federal funding sources like DHS port security grants pose challenges for government officials. Some LNG companies resist paying for additional maritime security, citing existing tax payments should cover public services. Others are willing to pay for extra security only if it exceeds standard levels. Security costs for LNG shipments may not reflect costs for securing other hazardous marine cargo. The security costs associated with LNG shipments may not be indicative of the costs to secure other EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo. New security technology and changing threat assessments may help lower hazardous marine cargo security costs in the future. Public agencies may need to review cost-sharing mechanisms for securing hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is still uncertain. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is uncertain, with questions raised about resource deployment and evaluation of security activities. The need for performance measures to define seaport security actions is highlighted, as assessing progress in making the nation more secure remains challenging. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is uncertain, with questions raised about resource deployment and evaluation of security activities. Assessing progress in making the nation more secure remains challenging due to the lack of performance measures to define seaport security actions. Some doubt whether Coast Guard security activities adequately address terrorism risks within and across ports based on quantitative risk analysis. The Coast Guard's internal maritime security plan identifies \"high risk cargos\" and conducts operations to address those risks. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping are questioned due to uncertainties in resource deployment and evaluation. There are concerns about whether security activities adequately address terrorism risks within ports, with questions about the level of protection for hazardous chemical vessels varying between ports. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping are questioned due to uncertainties in resource deployment and evaluation. Concerns arise about varying levels of protection for hazardous chemical vessels between ports, potentially leading to excessive security in some ports and inadequate security in others. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of the agency's hazardous marine cargo activities in the context of its larger maritime security responsibilities. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is also a significant concern among security analysts. The Homeland Security Council's national planning scenario involves chemical cargo ships with potential casualties of 350 deaths and 1,000 hospitalizations from an attack. Analysts suggest higher casualties for specific types of chemical tanker attacks near populated areas, which could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities. Toxic chemical attacks would require specialized medical treatment for poisoning and burns, complicating emergency response efforts. Salvage of a damaged vessel in such an attack would be challenging. An attack involving toxic chemicals could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities, requiring specialized treatment for poisoning and burns. Salvaging a damaged vessel in such an attack poses additional challenges due to the chemical hazard. It is prudent for authorities near potentially affected waterways to develop specific measures for dealing with chemical cargo releases, with federal or private sector assistance available for communities lacking in emergency response capabilities. Authorities near potentially affected waterways should develop specific measures for dealing with chemical cargo releases, with federal or private sector assistance available for communities lacking in emergency response capabilities. Funding sources such as the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program can support these efforts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for emergency response planning for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to quantities stored at large chemical facilities. The report highlights the potential risks of terrorist attacks on marine vessels carrying hazardous chemicals near populated areas in the U.S. Both government and industry have taken steps to improve maritime security for these shipments. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 serves as a legislative model for emergency response planning for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. The MTSA gives the Coast Guard authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping, with efforts to evolve security activities. Congress may question terrorism risk uncertainty and resource sufficiency for maritime chemical security. Congress may raise questions about terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate the resources for securing hazardous chemical cargo. Evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards is also of interest. Additionally, Congress may assess how U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security fits into the nation's overall strategy to protect the public from hazardous chemicals and cargo. The emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards and the integration of U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security into the nation's overall strategy are key concerns for Congress. Balancing resources for securing hazardous chemical cargo across different sectors poses a policy challenge due to varying homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, complicates this issue. Balancing resources for securing hazardous chemical cargo across different sectors is a policy challenge due to varying homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, complicates the comparison of terrorism risks. Without a comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks, security analysts may struggle to identify which assets to protect and how to allocate limited resources effectively. Diverting marine resources from safety to enhance security may reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective. Reviewing security priorities and activities to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge.

The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) for planning and managing projects. The ACE maintains separate domestic and foreign commerce databases, recording vessel trips and tonnages by commodity for U.S. ports and waterways. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. Vessel operators must report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE.

Vessel operators must report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE waterborne commerce databases may be used for chemical-specific analysis with limitations. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics for this report. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, with limitations and caveats regarding cargo classification inconsistencies. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, noting inconsistencies in commodity codes that may include other chemicals not on the EPA/RMP list. LNG and LPG were classified under the same code, but were separated using trade data for this report. Cargo volumes for chemicals vessels may involve loading or unloading at multiple locations during a single shipment. The ACE data reports movements at each point but cannot provide the total tonnage carried. Data quality issues may arise due to errors in classification, entry, and processing of the large ACE waterborne commerce databases. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with potential data quality issues due to errors in classification, entry, and processing. The report includes only summary estimates of chemicals shipping data.
