    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"district,\" \"domestic partner,\" \"family member,\" and \"firefighter.\" The curr_chunk further defines terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"firefighter,\" \"interment right,\" \"nonresident,\" and \"peace officer.\" These definitions clarify the rights and responsibilities associated with owning and using cemetery plots within a district. Chapter 5.5 (9069.10) of the Health and Safety Code defines terms related to interment rights in public cemetery districts, including \"nonresident,\" \"peace officer,\" \"principal county,\" and \"voter.\" These definitions clarify property interests and governance within the districts. Chapter 5.5 of the Health and Safety Code outlines interment rights in public cemetery districts, specifying that disinterment of human remains requires consent from the cemetery district and the surviving spouse, child, parent, or sibling. The chapter also allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances, with oversight from relevant authorities. The cemetery district must maintain records of any removal of remains, including the date, name, age, cemetery, and plot. If remains are reinterred, the district must record the new location, or if disposed of elsewhere, the alternate disposition. The date of reinterment must also be documented. The person making the removal of remains must provide a complete record to the cemetery district, including details such as the cemetery and plot from which the remains were removed, reinterment information if applicable, and the date of reinterment. An interment right grants a transferable property interest to the listed owner in the cemetery district records, with the option for written designation changes. It does not confer property title. The owner of an interment right can designate others for interment in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. The use of a transferred interment right must comply with state and local laws and district policies. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right will pass according to intestate succession laws. Compliance with state, local laws, and district policies is required for the use of transferred interment rights. A surviving spouse, registered domestic partner, child, parent, or heir can waive their interment right in favor of another relative. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership based on a sworn affidavit, they are not liable unless they knew the information was false. The successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement. A successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement and efforts to find other claimants. The district must notify purchasers of interment rights and their policies. Upon the sale of a cemetery plot, the district must inform the buyer about interment rights, ownership succession, and district policies. This act does not require reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes. The Commission on State Mandates will reimburse local agencies and school districts for any additional costs mandated by the state, as outlined in the Government Code."
