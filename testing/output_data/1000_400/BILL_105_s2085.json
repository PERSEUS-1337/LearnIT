    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the Truth in Employment Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The tactic of \"salting\" with union organizers infiltrating workplaces has become a form of aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of rights in collective bargaining. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm to competitors. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm to competitors. Employers should have the right to expect job applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing their skills to further the goals of the business. SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\nThe purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire individuals aiming to disrupt the workplace or cause economic harm.\n\nSEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. Amends Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals seeking employment to further another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants to self-organization, form labor organizations, bargain collectively, or engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to determine single location bargaining unit appropriateness. A blanket rule limiting factors for unit determination goes against the goal of promoting labor relations stability.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit. Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include provisions for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. The Board will consider various factors such as functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history in making its determination. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field for these entities. Therefore, a standard is needed to award fees and costs to small entities when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board. The purpose of this title is to address this imbalance. The National Labor Relations Board's greater expertise and resources compared to small businesses and labor organizations necessitate a standard that awards fees and costs to small entities when they prevail against the Board. The purpose is to ensure that small entities are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the Board due to the expense involved, reduce the resource and expertise disparity, and make the Board more accountable. The curr_chunk discusses the reasons for awarding fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board. This is to address the disparity in resources and expertise between small entities and the Board, and to hold the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section allowing for awards of attorneys' fees and costs. This aims to address resource and expertise disparities between small businesses, labor organizations, and the National Labor Relations Board, holding the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for awards of attorneys' fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations who prevail in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board. This provision aims to address disparities in resources and expertise and hold the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for awards of attorneys' fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations who prevail in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, regardless of the Board's justification. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow small businesses and labor organizations with less than 100 employees and a net worth of $1,400,000 or less to be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in civil actions, without considering the justification of the United States. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act specifies that the amendments apply to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of the Act."
