    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to provide estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the following calendar year. The Administrator must assess each cellulosic biofuel production facility's output from January 1 to October 31 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration must estimate cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming calendar year based on output from January 1 to October 31 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming year based on actual production from January to October. They determine the average monthly volume produced by each facility during this period. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming year by determining the estimated annualized volume of production for each facility based on the average monthly production from January to October. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming year based on the average monthly production from January to October, including facilities starting production after January 1 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming year based on the average monthly production from the date of initial production to October 31 of the facility. The Energy Information Administration estimates cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming year based on the facility's production from the date of initial production to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates annual cellulosic biofuel production volumes for a facility based on its average monthly production, determining the estimated volume for the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates annual cellulosic biofuel production volumes for facilities based on average monthly production, projecting the total volume for the following calendar year. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include a reduction in the applicable volume for cellulosic biofuel production. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include reducing the applicable volume for cellulosic biofuel production facilities. The definition of cellulosic biofuel is also clarified in the Act. Amendments to the Clean Air Act clarify the definition of cellulosic biofuel, excluding certain sources like compressed natural gas and electricity from biogas. The final rule by the EPA regulates cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways, including biogas production from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural digesters, and municipal solid waste digesters. The EPA's final rule regulates cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways, including biogas production from various sources. The rule also addresses conflicts with amendments and mandates reissuance to conform to the changes. The EPA will reissue a rule to conform to amendments made regarding cellulosic biofuel mandates, specifically removing the volume requirement for 2014."
