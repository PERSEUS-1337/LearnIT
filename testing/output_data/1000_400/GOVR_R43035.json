The transfer of power to the Union Government in 2011 marked progress towards a modern, developed, and democratic nation, although not all agree. President Thein Sein acknowledges the ongoing democratization process in Burma. President Thein Sein acknowledges the ongoing democratization process in Burma, but the vision of a \"disciplined democracy\" remains unclear. Key elements of a future democratic Burma, such as civilian control over the military and the structure of the government, are subjects of intense political debate. The political debate in Burma revolves around key issues such as civilian control over the military, the structure of the government, federal vs. central power, balance of power between branches, selection of President and Vice Presidents, citizenship conditions, and rights for Rohingyas. The military in Burma retains significant power, with key questions surrounding civilian control, selection of President and Vice Presidents, citizenship conditions for Rohingyas, and restrictions on civil liberties. The Tatmadaw, led by Commander-in-Chief Vice Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, remains opaque in its stance on political reforms and the military's role in Burma's \"disciplined democracy.\" The military in Burma, led by Commander-in-Chief Vice Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has refrained from public comments on political reforms. President Thein Sein appointed former generals to key ministerial positions, indicating military influence in the government. Hein was appointed Minister for Telecommunications, and Lieutenant General Thet Niang Win as Minister of Border Affairs, a position typically held by military officers. Around 18 out of 30 cabinet ministers were either current or former military officers as of March 2013. The Tatmadaw's actions suggest limited support for the Union Government and political reform, with Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang not publicly confirming orders to cease military operations against the KIO/KIA despite President Thein Sein's instructions. General Min Aung Hlaing's reassignment of top military personnel and replacement of Union Parliament members in 2012 have raised questions about his political intentions. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament in Burma have been strained, with tensions highlighted by incidents such as the questioning of military size during a 2013 session. General Min Aung Hlaing's reassignment of top military personnel and replacement of Union Parliament members in 2012 have raised questions about his political intentions. The military's role in political reform in Burma is uncertain, with tensions between the military and the Union Parliament highlighted by incidents such as questioning the military budget and land seizures. The military's pervasive presence in Burma's economy remains unresolved. The Tatmadaw confiscated over 247,000 acres of land and a commission recommended returning most of it to owners or the state, with compensation for displaced persons. The military's extensive economic involvement in sectors like mining, oil, and gas, as well as ownership of major corporations like UMEHL, remains unresolved in a reformed Burma. The military in Burma is allegedly involved in lucrative sectors such as mining, oil, and gas, with companies like UMEHL reportedly owned by the Ministry of Defense. These conglomerates, including Myawaddy Bank and Innwa Bank, provide the military with independent revenue and control over the nation's economy. The military in Burma, through companies like UMEHL and MEC-owned banks, generates revenue independently of the federal budget, giving them control over the economy. The Tatmadaw's corporate assets have been a source of income since the 1962 military coup, with senior military officers claiming responsibility for preserving Burma's current form. The 1962 military coup in Burma was a result of the democratic civilian government's failure to control ethnic militias. The Burmese military, known as the Tatmadaw, is designated in the 2008 Constitution as the main entity responsible for safeguarding the country's unity and sovereignty. The government has proposed a three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic groups opposing the current government. The first step involves negotiating a ceasefire with all ethnic militias. The government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve reconciliation with ethnic groups. The first step is to negotiate a ceasefire with all ethnic militias, followed by broader agreements on political and economic development. The final step involves amending the 2008 Constitution in line with the agreements. A \"peace committee\" has been established by the Union Government for this purpose. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to amend the 2008 Constitution and negotiate with ethnic militias. A \"peace committee\" has been formed, led by President Thein Sein and Vice-President Sai Mauk Kham, with Aung Min as the lead negotiator. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation involving direct negotiations with the Union Government. The Union Government's three-step peace process has been rejected by several ethnic organizations, including the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC). The UNFC proposed direct negotiations with the Union Government, followed by a national conference and convention to establish a federal union of Burma. Talks between the Union Government and ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, have had mixed results. The UNFC proposal does not assume the preservation of the 2008 Constitution or the disbanding/merger of militias into the Tatmadaw. Talks between the Union Government and ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, have had mixed results. Ceasefire agreements have been reached with 13 of 21 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal talks in China resulted in an agreement for future discussions, but none have completed the second step of the peace process. Issues remain regarding the powers of the central government and ethnic States in achieving national reconciliation in Burma. Several unresolved issues hinder national reconciliation in Burma, including the power struggle between the central government and ethnic States. The Burmese military's lack of participation in negotiations and attacks on ethnic militias further complicate the peace process. The Burmese military's lack of participation in negotiations and attacks on ethnic militias complicate national reconciliation efforts in Burma. The Union Government seeks to incorporate ethnic organizations into the current governance system, while major ethnic groups prefer equal talks with the government. The Union Government in Burma is pushing for national reconciliation within the framework of the 2008 Constitution, aiming to integrate ethnic organizations into the political system. However, major ethnic groups are hesitant to engage in talks under the assumption of the Constitution's legitimacy. The drafting of the Constitution by the SPDC without input from opposition parties and ethnic organizations poses a challenge to the reconciliation process. The drafting of the 2008 Constitution in Burma was done without input from opposition parties and ethnic organizations, leading to questions about its legitimacy. The Constitution is seen as a tool to protect the power of the Burmese military, with the national referendum and parliamentary elections being viewed as fraudulent. Despite this, the Union Government and military consider the Constitution as the legitimate governing document. The 2008 Constitution in Burma is widely seen as fraudulent, raising questions about the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments to the constitution, including modifications to the Tatmadaw's privileged status, but not ones that would fundamentally alter their special status. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, also seek changes to the constitution. The Tatmadaw is open to limited changes to the constitution, including amendments that would not fundamentally alter their special status. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, also seek amendments to the 2008 Constitution, particularly to allow her to serve as President after the 2015 parliamentary elections. Ethnic organizations do not accept the 2008 Constitution and are unlikely to comply with its provisions for amending the constitution. The NLD and other opposition parties are willing to follow the amendment process in the constitution, but many ethnic organizations do not accept the 2008 Constitution. They prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for changes in the national government and a new constitution. The requirements to amend the constitution may hinder implementing a negotiated agreement. Chapter XII of the 2008 Constitution outlines the amendment process, requiring a bill to be submitted to the Union Parliament and supported by at least 20% of members for consideration. The 2008 Constitution outlines the arduous process to amend it, requiring a bill to be supported by at least 20% of Union Parliament members and approved by 75% of members. Certain sections also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum. The 2008 Constitution outlines the difficult process to amend it, requiring support from 20% of Union Parliament members and approval from 75% of members. Specific sections also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum, including provisions related to the government structure, military's role, state of emergency, President eligibility, and constitutional amendments. Amendments must also gain support from military appointees in the Union Parliament, indirectly requiring the Tatmadaw's approval. The 2008 Constitution outlines the difficult process to amend it, requiring support from 20% of Union Parliament members and approval from 75% of members. Amendments must also gain support from military appointees in the Union Parliament, indirectly requiring the Tatmadaw's approval. Any amendment must be approved by more than 50% of eligible voters, which could be a challenge due to low voter turnout in past elections.

Additionally, the compilation of lists of Burmese individuals and entities subject to sanctions has faced criticism for compliance with existing laws. The compilation of lists of Burmese individuals and entities subject to sanctions under various laws has faced criticism for compliance issues. The Department of State maintains a list of Burmese nationals banned from receiving US entry visas. Financial sanctions under the BFDA and Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act freeze assets and prohibit financial services for individuals subject to visa bans. These sanctions are enforced by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act imposes financial sanctions on Burmese individuals banned from entering the US.

The 113th Congress may consider funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, including aid to landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, and democracy promotion. President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton made commitments to provide assistance, leading to the reopening of the USAID mission in Rangoon with plans for expansion requiring additional federal funding.

Post-sequestration funding levels for Burma are uncertain, but a rough estimate could be a 5% reduction from FY2012 estimates. Once final FY2013 funding legislation is passed, allocations and sequestration calculations can be determined. The sequestration makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Burma. A rough estimate could be a 5% reduction from FY2012 estimates.
