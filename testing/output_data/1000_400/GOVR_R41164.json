    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grants and loans, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, while RUS received $2.5 billion for rural broadband projects. The NTIA grant program, BTOP, and RUS/USDA received $2.5 billion for broadband grants and loans in rural areas. P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money. Two rounds of ARRA broadband funding were provided. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) received $2.5 billion for broadband grants and loans in rural areas. P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money. Two rounds of ARRA broadband funding were provided, with all funds awarded by September 30, 2010. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding, presenting a breakdown of applications and awards data as of October 1, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds have been awarded, with a breakdown of applications and awards data. The first funding round included projects for last mile, middle mile, and public computer centers. The ARRA broadband funds included projects for last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Last mile projects could be in remote or nonremote areas, while middle mile projects were also eligible for funding. The ARRA broadband funds included projects for last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Projects for last mile could be in remote or nonremote areas, with grants available up to $400 million for remote areas and loans/grants up to $800 million for nonremote areas. Middle mile projects were also eligible for funding with loans/grants up to $800 million. Over 2,200 applications were received during the first round, requesting nearly $28 billion in funding, seven times more than available. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, $4.8 billion was made available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. The application process was streamlined based on feedback from the first round, with separate NOFAs for each agency. Applicants could choose which agency to apply to. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, $4.8 billion was available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. The application process was streamlined with separate NOFAs for each agency. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for anchor institutions. BIP removed the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for anchor institutions, while BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. The requirement for eligible infrastructure projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated, and BIP projects in the second round had to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects required only an eligible entity, a completed application, and a nonfederal match of 20% or more. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP added three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. RUS published separate Request for Proposals for each program. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion in requested federal funding. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. This is 26% less than the number of applications received in the first round. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS received 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. RUS also received 27 applications for Satellite Projects, 51 for Technical Assistance, and 2 for Rural Library Broadband. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects totaling $7.5 billion, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. In October 2010, NTIA and RUS completed all BTOP and BIP award announcements, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects. This included $3.9 billion for 233 BTOP projects and $3.6 billion for 320 BIP projects, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdowns are available by project category, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. About half of the funding (51%) went to middle mile projects. Table 2 and Table 3 provide breakdowns of awards data by project category and program. 51% of broadband infrastructure funding was awarded to middle mile projects, while 49% was awarded to last mile projects. Last mile projects received 93% of loan funding. Fiber projects accounted for 56% of all infrastructure projects funded. The majority of loan funding (93%) was awarded to last mile projects, with fiber projects making up 56% of all infrastructure projects funded. Projects involving fiber technologies accounted for about two-thirds of all infrastructure projects. Last mile project technologies included 47% fiber, 23% DSL, 17% wireless, 6% multiple, 3% cable modem, and 1% satellite. State-by-state breakdowns of funding are shown in Table A-1 and per capita funding by state in Table A-2. The BTOP and BIP funding breakdown by state and per capita is shown in Table A-1 and Table A-2. NTIA and RUS are now overseeing the progress of funded infrastructure projects, which must be completed within three years. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA in its FY2011 budget proposal. In FY2011, NTIA and RUS are monitoring funded projects, with a focus on completion within three years. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA in its budget proposal. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability and adoption. The NTIA has awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability, adoption, and economic and social conditions in areas served by grantees. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects, while the FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends an expansion of federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of funding could provide insights into the success and failures of BTOP and BIP projects. The funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas could provide insights into the success and failures of BTOP and BIP projects, informing potential modifications or expansions of broadband grant and loan programs within a national broadband policy."
