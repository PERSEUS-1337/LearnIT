This includes Head Start Programs, state-funded prekindergarten programs, licensed child care for prekindergarten children, and special education preschools. The Act also authorizes a program to provide assistance to states for improving early childhood education. The Secretary of Education, with input from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can grant funds to States for implementing activities outlined in section 6. Applications for the grants are authorized. Each State seeking a grant under this Act must submit an application to the Secretary of Education, including details of their early childhood professional development system developed in collaboration with various stakeholders. The State agency responsible for administering childcare, the State Head Start collaboration director, the State educational agency, institutions of higher education, organizations representing early childhood educators, and credible early childhood education professional organizations are involved in the grant program. The State must designate an agency to administer the program and describe how the system provides oversight, professional standards, career pathways, and coordination with higher education entities. The curr_chunk discusses professional standards, career lattice, coordination with higher education entities, articulation agreements, accessible higher education for working learners, and support for adult learners who are dual language. The curr_chunk focuses on providing more accessible higher education for working learners, supporting adult learners from low-income or minority communities, using workforce data to assess needs, and financing over time.

To support preschool teachers, state grants aim to provide scholarships for pursuing a degree in early childhood education, help teachers with degrees in other fields obtain credentials in early childhood education, increase compensation for teachers working towards an early childhood education degree, and offer professional development opportunities addressing child development, teacher-child interaction, and family engagement. Opportunities for preschool teachers and teacher assistants in early childhood education programs focus on all areas of child development, teacher-child interaction, family engagement, and cultural competence for diverse children and families. Grant funds provided under this Act must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, and local funds for early childhood educator preparation. States receiving funds must maintain or increase their financial support for these activities each year. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 to implement this Act."
