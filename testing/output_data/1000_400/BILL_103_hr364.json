Congress finds that marketing conditions in the livestock and meat industry are detrimental to free competition, leading to unfair competition, burdening commerce, and obstructing the free flow of goods. The Act aims to address unfair competition and burdens on commerce in the livestock and meat industry by regulating trade and communication among states. The Act defines key terms related to the livestock and meat industry, such as \"Commerce,\" \"Livestock,\" \"Meat food products,\" \"Meatpacker,\" and \"Meat marketer.\" These definitions aim to regulate trade and communication among states in the industry. The Act defines key terms related to the livestock and meat industry, such as \"Meatpacker\" and \"Meat marketer,\" who are engaged in buying, selling, or preparing meats for sale or shipment. The definition of \"Person\" includes various entities involved in the industry. The Act defines \"Meatpacker or meat marketer engaged in commerce\" as a meatpacker or meat marketer involved in the production, processing, manufacturing, or distribution of meat food products with annual gross sales of at least $250,000 in the last three years. This definition includes various entities such as associations, corporations, legal representatives, joint stock companies, trustees, and receivers in bankruptcy and reorganization, common-law trusts, or any organized group, whether or not incorporated.

Violating this law can result in fines up to $50,000 or specific amounts per head of slaughtered animals.
