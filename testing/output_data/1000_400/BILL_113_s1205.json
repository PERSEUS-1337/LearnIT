    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity. Local waste heat and renewable energy resources can be used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity to meet energy requirements in communities in the United States. This utilization can strengthen industrial competitiveness and enhance energy supply reliability in response to extreme weather events or power grid failures. District energy systems are crucial for utilizing waste heat and renewable energy resources, enhancing industrial competitiveness, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, increasing energy supply resiliency, and creating local jobs. They also play a key role in expanding combined heat and power systems. District energy systems are vital for keeping energy dollars local, creating jobs, tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, expanding combined heat and power systems, serving various institutions and areas, and reducing power demand and constraints through thermal storage and CHP systems. District energy systems play a crucial role in reducing power demand and constraints in various areas like hospitals, airports, military bases, and downtown areas. Evaluation and implementation of these systems involve technical, economic, legal, and institutional challenges, often requiring technical assistance to overcome barriers. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, and decrease air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Implementation of district energy systems involves various technical, economic, legal, and institutional challenges, often requiring technical assistance to overcome barriers. Lack of low-interest, long-term capital funding is a major constraint to utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to encourage the use and distribution of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure by providing technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, and strengthen industrial competitiveness. It also provides technical assistance and low-cost financing for the implementation of local energy infrastructure. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve energy supply resiliency, decrease air pollution, and boost industrial competitiveness. The Act promotes the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve energy supply resiliency, decrease air pollution, and boost industrial competitiveness. It defines terms like \"combined heat and power system\" as a system that generates electric energy and heat efficiently, and \"district energy system\" as a system providing thermal energy to buildings. The \"Loan Guarantee Program\" is also defined. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program supports the use of waste heat and renewable energy resources to provide energy for various end uses in buildings. It includes systems that recover or produce energy from waste or renewable sources, generate electricity efficiently, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and distribute or transfer thermal energy. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program supports the use of waste heat and renewable energy resources for energy generation, distribution, and storage. It includes systems that generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and transfer thermal energy to building heating and cooling systems via a district energy system. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that can operate independently or connect to the main grid. The term \"renewable energy resource\" includes biomass, gaseous or liquid fuels, geothermal energy, and municipal solid waste. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" includes heating or cooling energy from renewable sources, natural cooling sources, and other sources determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"thermal energy\" refers to heating energy in the form of hot water or steam for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, and cooling energy in the form of chilled water or ice for air conditioning or process cooling. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy contained in exhaust gases, exhaust steam, or condenser. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy contained in exhaust gases, exhaust steam, condenser water, jacket cooling heat, or lubricating oil in power generation systems, as well as in exhaust heat, hot liquids, or flared gas from industrial processes. The term \"waste energy\" includes gas from industrial processes, waste gas, pressure drops in gas, condenser water, and other forms of waste energy as determined by the Secretary. This energy is not being used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The Technical Assistance Program is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure, including assistance with waste energy or renewable energy resources, technical and economic characteristics assessment, utility interconnection, negotiation of contracts, and permitting and siting issues. The program provides technical assistance for identifying opportunities to use waste energy or renewable resources, assessing technical and economic characteristics, utility interconnection, negotiating contracts, permitting and siting, marketing, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Information dissemination includes case studies and computer software for energy assessment and design. The program offers technical assistance for identifying local energy opportunities, including case studies and computer software for assessment and design. Nonprofit or for-profit entities are eligible for grants to cover costs of initial assessments and feasibility studies for local energy infrastructure implementation. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities for various costs related to local energy opportunities, including initial assessments, feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary for technical assistance as required. The Secretary awards grants for local energy opportunities, including assessments, feasibility studies, and engineering. Eligible entities must apply for technical assistance on a competitive basis, with priority given to projects reducing fossil fuel use and enhancing energy supply reliability. The Secretary prioritizes projects based on maximizing fossil fuel elimination, enhancing energy supply reliability, minimizing environmental impact, promoting renewable energy, boosting industrial competitiveness, and creating local jobs. The Secretary prioritizes projects based on maximizing fossil fuel elimination, enhancing energy supply reliability, minimizing environmental impact, promoting renewable energy, boosting industrial competitiveness, and creating local jobs. The Secretary shall adopt rules and procedures for the administration of the program established under this section within 180 days of enactment. $150,000,000 is authorized to carry out this section for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. This section introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary may provide loan guarantees for commercial or innovative projects defined as 'local energy infrastructure' under the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013. $4 billion of loan guarantee authority under section 1703 is reserved for this purpose, and unobligated funds from section 1703 may be used for loan guarantees under this section. SEC. 6. Definition of investment area amended to include potential for local energy infrastructure implementation as per the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
