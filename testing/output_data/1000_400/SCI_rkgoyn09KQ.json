    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modelling. The LSTM-LM considers word order in local collocation patterns, while the TM learns a latent representation from the entire document. The LSTM-LM captures language characteristics like syntax and semantics, while the TM uncovers thematic structure in a collection of documents. The ctx-DocNADE model combines a topic model and a language model to learn word meanings in a unified probabilistic framework. It addresses challenges in topic modeling with limited context or small training corpus by incorporating external knowledge through word embeddings in a LSTM-LM. The ctx-DocNADE model improves topic modeling in small text datasets by incorporating external knowledge through word embeddings in a LSTM-LM. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models and embeddings priors outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in terms of generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE are commonly used for topic extraction from text collections. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order and semantic information. The motivation is to extend these models to incorporate word order and language structure for better analysis. Traditional topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE ignore word order and semantic information, representing context as a bag of words. To improve analysis, there is a need to extend these models to incorporate word order and language structure. For example, in topic analysis, considering word order can help determine the topic generating a word like \"bear\" in a specific context. Traditional topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE ignore word order and semantic information, representing context as a bag of words. In topic analysis, considering word order can help determine the topic generating a word like \"bear\" in a specific context. However, recent research has shown that deep contextualized LSTM-based language models can capture different language concepts in a layer-wise fashion. Recent studies have integrated latent topics with neural language models to improve semantics at a document level. LSTM-LMs capture language concepts in a layer-wise fashion but lack global dependencies. Traditional topic models like LDA and n-gram models can capture word order but struggle with semantics. TDLM BID14, Topic-RNN (Dieng et al., 2016) and TCNLM BID32 integrate latent topics with neural language models to improve semantics. While bi-gram LDA based topic models BID31 BID33 and n-gram based topic learning BID15 capture word order in short contexts, they struggle with long term dependencies. DocNADE variants BID12 BID8 learn word occurrences across documents but ignore language structure. BID17 shows that recurrent neural networks reduce perplexity in language modeling. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, incorporates language structure into neural autoregressive models using LSTM-LM. This allows for accurate word prediction by considering global and local contexts, improving semantics and capturing long-range dependencies. The proposed neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, combines global and local contexts for word probability, integrating DocNADE and LSTM-LM. It captures complementary semantics by merging word and topic learning in a unified framework. The model incorporates language structure and word order, particularly beneficial for long texts and corpora with many documents. However, learning from contextual information remains challenging in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences and context. In stock market trading, global semantic view is important. However, learning from contextual information is challenging in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences and context. Distributional word representations like word embeddings have shown to capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words. Traditional topic models may struggle to infer relatedness between word pairs in short text fragments. Word embeddings like BID22 capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, improving NLP tasks. Traditional topic models struggle with short text analysis, but embeddings show relatedness between word pairs like (falls, drops). Previous work like BID26 used web search results to enhance short text information, while BID24 incorporated word similarity from thesauri and dictionaries into LDA. BID5 and BID20 integrated word embeddings into LDA and DMM models, and BID8 extended DocNADE with pre-trained word embeddings for topic learning. Contributing to the field of NLP, this work enhances DocNADE by incorporating distributed compositional priors using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM. This approach improves latent topic and textual representations in short texts or smaller corpora. Unlike previous models, this method considers word ordering and syntax, outperforming traditional topic models like LDA and RSM in terms of perplexity and information retrieval. Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE enhances latent topic and textual representations using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM. This approach combines complementary learning and external knowledge to model short and long text documents in a unified neural autoregressive framework, named ctx-DocNADEe. The method improves generalizability, interpretability, and applicability through better textual representations. Our approach, ctx-DocNADEe, improves textual representations by enhancing generalizability, interpretability, and applicability. It outperforms state-of-the-art generative topic models on various datasets, showing gains in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and F1 for text classification. The proposed modeling approaches generate contextualized topic vectors, named textTOvec, for short-text and long-text documents. The code is available at https: Our proposed modeling approach, textTOvec, improves textual representations by enhancing generalizability, interpretability, and applicability. It shows gains in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and F1 for text classification on various datasets. The code for textTOvec is available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. The approach involves generative models like Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and its variants, as well as NADE BID13 to address the challenge of estimating complex probability distributions. Machine (RBM) BID9 and its variants BID11, along with RSM (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) and its variants BID7, are used for modeling word counts. NADE BID13 decomposes the joint distribution of binary observations into autoregressive conditional distributions using a feed-forward network, providing tractable gradients for data negative log-likelihood. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as bags of words, focusing on learning word representations reflecting document topics only. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as bags of words, learning word representations reflecting document topics only through a feed-forward neural network. It disregards language structure and semantic features encoded in word embeddings. The DocNADE model uses a neural network with hidden units to analyze document content. It includes weight matrices, bias vectors, and word representation matrices. The log-likelihood of a document is calculated based on word observations. Two extensions of the model are proposed: ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe. These models aim to improve language structure and semantic features in word embeddings. The DocNADE model is extended with ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models, incorporating language structure and external knowledge through pre-trained word embeddings. These models consider word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge to overcome limitations of BoW-based representations. Each document is treated as a sequence of multinomial observations in these models. The ctx-DocNADE model enhances DocNADE by incorporating language structure, word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge through pre-trained word embeddings. It treats each document as a sequence of multinomial observations and utilizes LSTM-based components to calculate conditional probabilities of words. The word vectors in ctx-DocNADE are influenced by hidden vectors from LSTM-based components. The weight matrix W of DocNADE encodes topic information for hidden features. The embedding layer in the LSTM component is randomly initialized to account for word ordering and language concepts. The second version of ctx-DocNADE includes distributional priors in the LSTM embedding layer. In this realization of the unified network, the embedding layer in the LSTM component is randomly initialized to account for word ordering and language concepts. The second version extends this by adding distributional priors to the LSTM embedding layer. The computational complexity is reduced in DocNADE due to tied weights in the matrix W. In the DocNADE component, weights in matrix W are tied, reducing computational complexity to O(HD). In ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe, complexity is O(HD + N) with LSTM network edges. DeepDNEe extends DocNADE and LSTM to multiple hidden layers for improved performance. The trained models can be used to extract a text representation. DeepDNEe extends DocNADE and LSTM to multiple hidden layers for improved performance, with the last layer computing the conditional probability. State-of-the-art comparison is done for IR precision and classification F1 for short texts. The hidden vectors h DN i,1 and h LM i,1 correspond to equations 1 and 2. Conditional probability is computed using the last layer n. Modeling approaches are applied to short-text and long-text datasets for topic model evaluation.

BID14 was utilized to evaluate representation quality in short-text datasets. Generative performance of topic models was assessed by estimating log-probabilities for test documents and computing average held-out perplexity per word. The log-probabilities for test documents are estimated to compute average held-out perplexity per word in topic models. The optimal \u03bb is determined based on the validation set, with complementary learning achieving lower perplexity in ctx-DocNADE compared to baseline DocNADE. Topic coherence is assessed to evaluate the meaningfulness of captured topics. In ctx-DocNADE, using \u03bb = 0.01 achieves lower perplexity than baseline DocNADE for short and long texts. Topic coherence is assessed using a measure proposed by BID25, showing higher coherence scores in ctx-DocNADE compared to DocNADE (.772 vs .755).
