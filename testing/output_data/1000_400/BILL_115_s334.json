    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities, as highlighted in reports by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities is supported by reports from the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. Studies have found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing. The Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission have found no evidence of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Lisa Jackson testified before the House of Representatives on the safety of operations regulated by states. States have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water during hydraulic fracturing. Lisa Jackson and Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey testified that there is no proven case of water contamination or adverse effects from fracking chemicals. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are monitored for surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions. In 2011, Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey stated that there is no evidence of adverse effects from fracking chemicals. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes, but Congress has chosen not to include the process in underground injection regulations. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing chemicals in aquifers. The Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing chemicals in aquifers. The Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange reported that states have improved groundwater protection laws for oil and gas production. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND: Federal land includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. SEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on state land. Federal land follows the laws of the state where it is located for such treatments."
