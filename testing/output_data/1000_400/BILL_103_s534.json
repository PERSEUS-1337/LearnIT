    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" establishes levels of coverage exceeding 75% of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)) is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural producers in the United States against various unavoidable causes of loss, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more, as determined by the Board. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows insurance coverage for agricultural producers against unavoidable causes of loss such as drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more as determined by the Board. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field, with aquacultural species defined as the environment where the commodity is produced. The Federal Crop Insurance Act provides coverage for agricultural producers against various causes of loss. For aquacultural species, the term 'field' refers to the production environment. Standard yield coverage offers protection for 75% of the average yield on the insured farm, with adjustments made by the Board for fairness. The Federal Crop Insurance Act provides coverage for agricultural producers against various causes of loss. Average yields established by the Board may be adjusted for fairness among farms in the same area. The Corporation offers lesser levels of yield coverage, including 50% coverage of the recorded or appraised average yield. Adjusted yields are also considered for commodities with established yields by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. Insurance coverage can be provided based on adjusted yields established by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, rather than recorded or appraised yields by the Corporation. Additional premiums may apply for this coverage. Loss in yield of the commodity can be covered based on adjusted yields established by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, with additional premiums set by the Board to accurately reflect increased risk and cover potential losses. Coverage levels exceeding 75 percent may require extra premiums. The Corporation may offer coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield in growing areas if normal yield variations haven't led to loss claims. The maximum coverage level is subject to certain exceptions. The Corporation may offer coverage levels up to 75 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield, with exceptions. One price election must approximate the projected market price, and insurance does not cover losses due to producer neglect or malfeasance. The Board determines the market price for commodities, insurance does not cover losses due to neglect or malfeasance of the producer, failure to reseed or follow good farming practices, and insurance may be limited based on risk. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on risk, not provide insurance for commodities with unimportant income in a county, and report annual results to Congress. The Corporation reports annually to Congress on its operations for each insured commodity, establishes a minimum price level for insurance, and offers coverage based on price elections set by the Board. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include late planting coverage, allowing producers to plant after the final planting date for up to 25 days with reduced yield guarantee. Late planting coverage under the Federal Crop Insurance Act reduces the yield guarantee by 1-2 percent per day for delays beyond the normal final planting date. Producers have this coverage unless they opt out, and premiums may increase if late planting coverage is included. Late planting coverage is included in the basic insurance policy under the Federal Crop Insurance Act unless producers opt out. If the Corporation believes that including late planting coverage would significantly raise premiums and discourage participation, it will offer it as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage allows for 50% of the guaranteed level of coverage if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop. Producers are eligible for 50% coverage of the guaranteed level for the crop. They can plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop, which will offset the coverage. Producers have prevented planting coverage unless they waive it. If prevented planting coverage raises premiums too much, participation may be discouraged. The Act offers prevented planting coverage to producers unless they waive it. If this coverage increases premiums significantly, the Corporation will provide it as a separate endorsement to avoid discouraging participation in the program. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of the production is lower than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data may only be used for establishing yields. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data may only be used to establish a yield for producers on a farm if they have not established actual production history for the first 4 crop years. After establishing actual production history, yield coverage will be based only on actual production history for the commodity. For the first 4 crop years, yield coverage is based on actual production history. Producers on a new parcel of land can use previous yield history if deemed actuarially sound. The Corporation will make adjustments in Nonstandard classification procedures. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard classification procedures to address producer yield declines from natural disasters. Transitional yield data is used for producers without actual production records. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard classification procedures to address producer yield declines from natural disasters by using transitional yield data for producers without actual production records."
