We extend existing datasets to create benchmarks with additional relations like textual descriptions and images. Our model effectively utilizes this additional information to improve accuracy and predict missing attributes. Knowledge bases (KB) play a crucial role in this approach. Our model utilizes additional information from datasets like MovieLens-100k-plus to improve accuracy and predict missing attributes in relational databases. Knowledge bases are essential in various computational systems but often suffer from incompleteness and noise, leading to active research in relational knowledge representation. Learning relational knowledge representation has been a focus of active research to address deficiencies in knowledge bases, such as incompleteness and noise. These approaches encode uncertainty and infer missing facts accurately and efficiently by estimating fixed, low-dimensional representations for entities and relations. Real-world knowledge bases contain various data types beyond fixed entities, including numerical, textual, and image attributes. Real-world knowledge bases contain various data types beyond fixed entities, including numerical, textual, and image attributes. These different types of relations, such as textual descriptions and images, can provide crucial evidence for knowledge base completion. However, they also have limitations like missing data, noise, and the need for prediction to address queries. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases that include textual, images, numerical, and categorical data types. The approach aims to go beyond traditional link-based modeling, address missing data and noise, and represent uncertainty in relational evidence. The method is applied to the DistMult approach, extending its capabilities. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases with various data types. The approach extends the DistMult method by incorporating neural encoders for different types of evidence data, such as images and textual attributes. The scoring module remains the same, producing a score indicating the likelihood of a triple being correct. This unified model facilitates information flow across different data types.

The model is evaluated on relational databases with additional relations, showing improved link-prediction accuracy. In the relational setting, two benchmarks are introduced by extending existing datasets to include additional relations like textual descriptions, numerical attributes, and images. The model effectively utilizes this extra information for improved link-prediction accuracy. Knowledge bases contain various types of information about entities, and existing approaches focus on embedded relational modeling. In the relational setting, knowledge bases contain diverse information about entities. Existing approaches focus on embedded relational modeling to train machine learning models for scoring the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets. The goal is to extend these approaches to a multimodal setting, incorporating all available information types for improved link prediction accuracy. The modeling approach involves training a machine learning model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets. The link prediction problem aims to learn a scoring function for entities and relations in a knowledge base, using observed facts as training data. Successful methods involve models that learn representations for entities and relations, with varying operators applied to these representations. The proposed framework can be used with existing relational models, with a focus on the DistMult approach. The modeling approach involves training a machine learning model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets. Success on this task consists of models that learn fixed-length vectors, matrices, or tensors for each entity and relation, with a scoring function involving varying operators applied to these learned representations. The focus is on the DistMult approach, where entities are mapped to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices, computing the score for triples using a pairwise ranking loss. The scoring function for triples in the DistMult approach involves a pairwise ranking loss to differentiate between existing and non-existing triples. Negative samples are generated by replacing entities in training triplets, allowing for learning of entity and relation representations for knowledge base completion, queries, or cleaning. In real-world knowledge bases, the assumption of fixed entity sets for subjects and objects may not hold true. The proposed work aims to enhance existing relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for various data types such as numerical, categorical, images, and text.

The encoding component incorporates different types of information as relational triples to compute embeddings, including numerical values, images, and text. Various methods utilize extra information as observed features for entities, such as merging, concatenating, or averaging entity features. Some approaches address multilingual relation extraction tasks and use matrix factorization to jointly embed knowledge bases and textual relations. Graph embedding approaches consider a fixed number of attributes in the encoding component for more accurate embedding. The model discussed in the text differs from these approaches in three ways: it is the first to use different types of information in a unified model, it treats extra information as features, and it achieves a more accurate embedding. Our model differs from existing approaches in three key ways: it integrates different types of information in a unified model, treats this information as relational triples of structured knowledge, and represents uncertainty to support missing values and information recovery.
