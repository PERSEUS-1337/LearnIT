    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters, administered since August 1987. National defense activities at San Nicolas Island have not harmed sea otters, but their expansion into the designated management zone may pose national security risks. Public Law 99-625 allows for the management of southern sea otters in designated zones, with concerns about potential national security impacts. Military training programs must adapt to real-world events, requiring flexibility in training events. Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address the needs of threatened species and provide conservation benefits to marine environments. Management Plans for military installations in California address the special management needs of threatened and endangered species, providing conservation benefits to marine environments. Public Law 99-625 allows for the designation of otters at San Nicolas Island as a nonessential experimental population to meet military readiness requirements. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter population while ensuring reasonable assurances. The designation should continue to provide flexibility for military readiness requirements guaranteed by Public Law 99-625. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter population while allowing for military readiness activities. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates in the Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock area. The coordinates for designated military areas include Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, and adjacent waters. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas were designated by 33 C.F.R. part 165 on May 20, 2010, including Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and adjacent waters with specific coordinates. Activities within these areas are exempt from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 regarding the incidental taking of southern sea otters. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, designated in 2010, exempt military activities from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act regarding incidental takings of southern sea otters. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, designated in 2010, exempt military activities from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act regarding incidental takings of southern sea otters. Sections 101 and 102 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 do not apply to the incidental taking of southern sea otters in these areas during military readiness activities. Southern sea otters in these areas are treated as species proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas treat southern sea otters as proposed endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. The Secretary of the Interior can revise exceptions if military activities substantially impede sea otters. No otters need to be removed from the areas. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate exceptions for military activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas if they impede sea otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy must monitor the otter population every three years and report to Congress and the public on the findings. The Secretary of the Navy is required to monitor the southern sea otter population every three years and report to Congress and the public. This monitoring is not intended to repeal, supersede, or modify any other federal laws. Ecosystem management plans are to be developed in cooperation with relevant agencies. Ecosystem Management: Directors of US Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, with Marine Mammal Commission, to develop a plan for California waters ensuring recovery of southern sea otter, black abalone, white abalone, and sustainable shellfish harvest levels. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of southern sea otter habitat and continue implementing the relocation and management plan until a new plan is developed. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until a new plan is completed. Definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided. The term 'optimum sustainable population' refers to the maximum number of animals that will ensure the productivity of a population or species, considering habitat capacity and ecosystem health. 'Southern sea otter' is defined as a member of the Enhydra lutris nereis subspecies. 'Take' has a specific meaning under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The term 'take' has specific meanings under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.
