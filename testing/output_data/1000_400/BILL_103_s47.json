Special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases are outlined in a new chapter inserted into Title 28 of the United States Code. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, addressing the appointment of counsel and procedures for appointment. The new chapter in Title 28 of the United States Code outlines special habeas corpus procedures for prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence. It applies if a State has a mechanism for appointing competent counsel in post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. The new chapter in Title 28 of the United States Code outlines special habeas corpus procedures for prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence. It applies to indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have been upheld on direct appeal, providing for the appointment of competent counsel in post-conviction proceedings. The mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under a capital sentence and provide standards for competency in the appointment of such counsel. The new chapter in Title 28 of the United States Code outlines special habeas corpus procedures for State prisoners with a capital sentence. It appoints counsel for indigent prisoners who have accepted or are unable to decide on legal offers, ensures understanding of legal consequences, and prohibits previously representing the prisoner unless requested. Sec. 2257 outlines special habeas corpus procedures for State prisoners with a capital sentence. It appoints counsel for non-indigent prisoners, prohibits prior representation without request, and addresses ineffectiveness of counsel in post-conviction proceedings. Sec. 2257 mandates a stay of execution for State prisoners upon invoking post-conviction review procedures, with the stay expiring if a habeas corpus is not filed. The application for a stay of execution under section 2254 must state that the State has initiated post-conviction review procedures. The stay expires if a habeas corpus petition is not filed within the required time or if relief is denied after court reviews and no certiorari petition is filed or denied. Before a court of competent jurisdiction, a State prisoner under a capital sentence can waive the right to pursue habeas corpus review under section 2254, if certain conditions are met. This includes the expiration of the time for filing a certiorari petition, denial of a timely certiorari petition by the Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court disposing of the case in a way that upholds the capital sentence. If any of these conditions occur, the prisoner cannot pursue habeas corpus review. A State prisoner under a capital sentence can waive the right to pursue habeas corpus review before a court of competent jurisdiction, under certain conditions. If these conditions are met, no Federal court can grant relief in a capital case unless the claim was not previously presented in State or Federal courts, or if the failure to raise the claim was due to State action violating the Constitution or laws of the United States, or due to a recognition by the Supreme Court of a new Federal right. The conditions for a State prisoner to waive habeas corpus review in a capital case include presenting a claim not previously raised in State or Federal courts, or if the failure to raise the claim was due to State action violating the Constitution or laws of the United States, or a new Federal right recognized by the Supreme Court. The claim must be based on facts that could not have been discovered earlier and must undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt. Sec. 2258 outlines the time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254, stating that it must be filed within 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c). The time requirements can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 must be met within 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c). The time requirements can be tolled in specific situations, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court or during post-conviction review pending before a State court. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be tolled in certain situations, including when a State prisoner has a pending post-conviction review before a State court or when counsel for the prisoner requests an extension of time in the Federal district court. The time requirement can be continuously tolled under specific circumstances. The time requirement for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be continuously tolled under specific circumstances, such as when a State prisoner files for post-conviction review until final disposition by the highest State court. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. Evidentiary hearings and the scope of Federal review are addressed in section 2259. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. When a State prisoner files a habeas corpus petition under section 2254, the district court determines the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on claims presented in State courts. The district court must address claims not raised in State courts due to State action, recognition of a new Federal right, or based on newly discovered facts. Evidentiary hearings are conducted as needed for habeas corpus review, and a complete record is required for ruling on the merits of the claims. The certificate of probable cause is not applicable in this context. The district court conducts evidentiary hearings for habeas corpus review and rules on the merits of claims. The certificate of probable cause is not required for appeals in habeas corpus cases under this chapter."
