    "content": "We investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation, testing a novel transformer variant that combines information from nearby characters using convolution. Our experiments on WMT and UN datasets show that our variant outperforms the standard transformer, converges faster, and learns more robust character-level alignments. Character-level models offer a more memory-efficient and compact language representation compared to word or subword-level models. Character-level models in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) are more memory-efficient and compact, operating directly on raw characters to mitigate out-of-vocabulary problems. Multilingual training using the same character vocabulary can improve overall performance without increasing model complexity or requiring separate models for each language pair. Models based on self-attention have shown excellent performance in tasks like machine translation and representation learning. Multilingual training can enhance overall performance without increasing model complexity or needing separate models for each language pair. Self-attention models have excelled in tasks like machine translation and representation learning. This study investigates the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a standard transformer with a novel convtransformer that uses convolution for character interactions. The models are evaluated on bilingual and character-level translation tasks. The study evaluates self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a standard transformer with a convtransformer using convolution for character interactions. Models are tested on bilingual and multilingual translation tasks, showing competitive performance with subword-level models and requiring fewer parameters. The convtransformer outperforms the standard transformer at the character level. The study compares self-attention models for character-level translation, finding that convtransformer performs better than the standard transformer. Lee et al. (2017) introduced fully character-level translation using a recurrent encoder-decoder model with convolutional layers and attention mechanisms. Lee et al. (2017) introduced a character-level translation model combining convolutional layers, max pooling, and highway layers in the encoder, with autoregressive decoding using attention. Their approach showed promising results for multilingual translation, with training on multiple source languages improving performance and acting as a regularizer. Multilingual training is feasible even for distant languages by mapping them to a common character-level representation. Cherry et al. (2018) later conducted a detailed comparison. Character-level models can outperform subword-level models in NLP tasks, as they offer greater flexibility in processing and segmenting input and output sequences. The transformer model, using self-attention instead of recurrence, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in sequence modeling tasks. The transformer model, utilizing self-attention, has shown superior performance in sequence modeling tasks in NLP. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of attention in character-level language modeling, prompting the exploration of the transformer's potential in character-level bilingual and multilingual translation. The convtransformer is proposed to investigate character-level interactions in the transformer for bilingual and multilingual translation. It includes a modified encoder with additional sub-blocks consisting of parallel 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes. The convtransformer modifies the encoder with additional sub-blocks of parallel 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes to investigate character-level interactions in bilingual and multilingual translation. The sub-block consists of three parallel 1D convolutional layers with context window sizes of 3, 5, and 7. The representations are fused using an additional convolutional layer, maintaining the input dimensionality. A residual connection from input to output is added for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on two datasets. In contrast to previous work, the convtransformer model maintains the input resolution and adds a residual connection for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and the United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN) for multilingual experiments in the same domain. The study by Lee et al. (2017) uses the newstest-2014 dataset for testing and the United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN) for main experiments. The UN dataset contains parallel sentences from six languages and is used for multilingual experiments. Training corpora are constructed by sampling one million sentence pairs from the FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset for translation to English. Multilingual datasets are created by combining bilingual datasets and shuffling them. The study uses the UN dataset with parallel sentences from six languages for multilingual experiments. Training corpora are created by sampling sentence pairs from FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset for translation to English. Bilingual datasets are combined and shuffled to create multilingual datasets. The experiments involve training models with single input languages and inputting two or three languages simultaneously without language identifiers. Testing is done using original UN test sets for each pair. In experiments, models are trained in bilingual and multilingual scenarios without language identifiers. BLEU performance comparison of character-level architectures on WMT dataset shows subword-level training is 3 to 5 times faster. Character-level transformers trained on the WMT dataset outperform subword-level models, achieving strong performance with fewer parameters. The convtransformer variant performs similarly to the standard transformer. Multilingual experiments on the UN dataset show competitive results using 6-layer transformer/convtransformer models trained for 30 epochs. Our convtransformer variant performs competitively with the standard transformer on the UN dataset, outperforming it by up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation. Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages. The convtransformer variant outperforms the standard transformer by up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation. Training on similar input languages improves performance for both languages. Distant-language training can be effective, but only when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is 30% slower to train but reaches comparable performance in less than half the number of epochs compared to the transformer. The convtransformer is slower to train than the transformer but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup. Analysis of learned character alignments in multilingual models shows that bilingual models may have an advantage in learning high-quality alignments compared to multilingual models. The bilingual model may have an advantage in learning high-quality alignments compared to multilingual models. Alignments are quantified using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on encoder-decoder attention from the last layer of each model. In the study, correlation analysis (CCA) was used to analyze alignment matrices extracted from encoder-decoder attention in transformer and convtransformer models. Results showed a strong positive correlation for similar source and target languages, but a drop in correlation when introducing a distant source language, indicating the challenge of multilingual training. The convtransformer model was found to be more robust in handling the introduction of a distant language.

The study tested self-attention models for character-level translation, including a standard transformer architecture and a variant with convolution in the encoder. Results showed competitive performance with subword-level models, especially when trained on multiple similar languages. However, performance dropped for distant languages. Future work will explore more languages and improve training efficiency for character-level models. In future work, the analysis will extend to include additional languages from different families, focusing on improving training efficiency for character-level models. Example model outputs and alignments are presented, showing differences between bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets. The study focuses on translation models from FR to EN using UN datasets. Results show that the convtransformer model has sharper word alignments than the transformer model for bilingual translation. For multilingual translation, the convtransformer produces less noisy alignments compared to the transformer, especially for distant languages like FR+ZH\u2192EN.
