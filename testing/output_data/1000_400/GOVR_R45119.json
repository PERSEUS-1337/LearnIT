    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule finalized in 2015 to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around its legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The CPP set national CO2 emission rates for power plants under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d), with state-specific goals and compliance options. Under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d), the CPP established national CO2 emission rates for existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants. States had the option to comply through a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach, providing flexibility in meeting the standards while minimizing costs. Emission reductions depended on states' compliance choices and other factors like fuel sources and electricity generation. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) set national CO2 emission rates for existing power plants, offering states flexibility in compliance methods. The proposed repeal of the CPP signifies a shift in the agency's interpretation of its authority under the Clean Air Act. EPA's analysis projected a 32% reduction in power sector CO2 emissions by 2030 under the CPP. The proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) signifies a significant change in the EPA's stance on CO2 emissions regulations for existing power plants. The EPA's current interpretation is that the CPP exceeds its legal authority under the Clean Air Act, specifically Section 111(d). This change is based on the belief that the CPP sets emission goals that can only realistically be achieved using measures that are considered \"outside the fence line\" of power plants. The agency also conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed repeal, which is classified as an economically significant regulatory action. The EPA estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, which is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The benefit-cost analysis reveals methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, potentially impacting how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations. Members of Congress may be interested in understanding the differences in benefit-cost comparisons between the 2017 and 2015 analyses. The EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan includes methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, which may affect how benefits and costs of regulations are estimated. Members of Congress are interested in understanding the differences in benefit-cost comparisons between the 2017 and 2015 analyses, as some changes may impact how federal agencies account for climate and human health benefits in developing regulations. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan repeal may influence how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits in regulations. It compares the 2015 and 2017 benefit-cost analyses, highlighting changes in estimating climate benefits. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan repeal compares the 2015 and 2017 benefit-cost analyses, focusing on changes in estimating climate benefits, human health co-benefits, and energy savings impact. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions in accordance with Executive Order 12866. The EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan, in accordance with Executive Order 12866. This order directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. E.O. 12866 outlines requirements for federal regulations, directing agencies to assess benefits and costs of significant actions. These include rules with annual economic impacts of $100 million or more, creating inconsistencies, altering budget impacts, or raising novel legal issues. Economically significant rules require detailed regulatory analysis. Rules that meet the criteria of having annual economic impacts of $100 million or more, creating inconsistencies, altering budget impacts, or raising novel legal issues are considered economically significant and require detailed regulatory analysis. OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on what constitutes a good regulatory analysis, emphasizing the need to state the regulatory action's necessity, analyze alternative approaches, and assess benefits and costs to standardize measurement and reporting across federal agencies. The OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on regulatory analysis, emphasizing the necessity of stating the proposed action, analyzing alternatives, and assessing benefits and costs to standardize measurement and reporting across federal agencies. The circular aims to quantify benefits and costs of economically significant regulations, recognizing that some impacts may be difficult to quantify. When the EPA promulgated the CPP in 2015, it prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and the agency's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals. In 2015, EPA determined the CPP rulemaking was economically significant and prepared a regulatory analysis. State-specific emission rate goals and emission goals were calculated for different scenarios. EPA emphasized the flexibility states had in implementing the CPP. Emission reductions and compliance costs were estimated using the Integrated Planning Model. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs included capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring/reporting/recordkeeping expenses. The EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP, including capital investment in new generating sources, heat rate improvements at coal-fired units, ongoing costs of operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring/reporting/recordkeeping expenses. The estimates also considered reductions in CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the use of the IPM model and social cost of carbon to estimate the economic value of associated climate benefits. The EPA estimated the reduction in CO2 emissions and applied the social cost of carbon to determine the economic value of climate benefits. This included changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. Additionally, the EPA quantified human health benefits from reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, monetizing the benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone. The EPA quantified human health benefits from reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions by monetizing the benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone, known as \"co-benefits.\" These benefits were calculated using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach for PM and ozone, estimating the average dollar value of health benefits associated with the reduction of one ton of pollutants. The monetized health co-benefits estimates focused on reductions in premature deaths and illnesses related to exposure to PM and ozone, with PM health effects contributing significantly to the overall estimates. The EPA analyzed human health benefits from reducing SO2 and NOx emissions by monetizing co-benefits of decreased exposure to PM and ozone. The majority of monetized health co-benefits came from PM-related reductions in premature deaths, with SO2 emission reductions contributing significantly. Ozone health effects accounted for a smaller share of the estimated dollar value of human health co-benefits in the scenarios analyzed for 2030. Monetized health co-benefits for reductions in SO2 accounted for 80-85% of estimated dollar value in 2030 scenarios, while ozone health effects contributed 6-12%. EPA, under the Trump Administration, proposed to repeal the CPP two years after finalization, following the same rulemaking process. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) mandates adherence to the rulemaking process for promulgating, revising, or repealing regulations, requiring data summary and methodology specification. The Clean Air Act Section 307(d) requires EPA to follow the same rulemaking process for promulgating, revising, or repealing regulations. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed repeal of the 2015 CPP, based on a change in legal interpretation of Section 111(d). The benefits of repealing a rule are the avoided costs, while the costs are the forgone benefits. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed repeal of the 2015 CPP, defining benefits as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health benefits. EPA did not conduct new power sector modeling for the 2017 analysis but used existing projections. EPA defined the costs of the proposed CPP repeal as the forgone reductions in CO2 and non-GHG emissions, along with associated climate and health benefits. EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The benefit-cost estimates were based on power sector modeling from 2015, estimating compliance costs and emissions reductions under different scenarios. The benefit-cost estimates for the proposed CPP repeal were based on power sector modeling results from 2015 and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. EPA used these projections to monetize avoided compliance costs and forgone benefits of the repeal, including changes in CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions under different scenarios. EPA also adjusted the accounting treatment of cost savings from demand-side energy efficiency. EPA used power sector modeling results from 2015 and projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017 to monetize the avoided compliance costs and forgone benefits of the proposed CPP repeal. The accounting treatment of cost savings from demand-side energy efficiency measures was adjusted, with EPA now counting them as a positive benefit of the CPP. The 2017 analysis showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons of the CPP compared to the 2015 analysis. EPA's 2015 analysis found that the benefits of the CPP outweighed the costs, with net benefits ranging from $25 billion to $45 billion in 2030. However, the 2017 analysis presented less favorable benefit-cost comparisons, with estimates ranging from costs outweighing benefits to benefits outweighing costs for the proposed repeal. The 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP showed varying estimates, with net costs ranging from $28.3 billion to net benefits of $14 billion in 2030. The analysis did not clearly state whether the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. The 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP showed varying estimates, with net costs ranging from $28.3 billion to net benefits of $14 billion in 2030. The benefit-cost estimates derived from the AEO 2017 projections likewise showed a range of net costs and net benefits of the proposed repeal under different assumptions. Half of these benefit-cost comparisons showed net benefits to repeal the CPP, and the other half showed net costs to repeal. The AEO-based estimates of the proposed repeal for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The effect of updated power sector projections on the proposed repeal's benefit-cost estimates is unclear. EPA noted that the benefit-cost estimates based on its. The AEO-based estimates of the proposed repeal for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. Changes in the power sector, such as shifts to lower-emitting sources, could impact CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA noted that benefit-cost estimates did not reflect recent changes in the power sector, including retirements of older generating units and changes in fuel prices and regulations. The AEO 2017 projections indicated a shift towards lower-emitting sources in electricity generation, potentially leading to lower CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the proposed repeal, with projections showing greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits compared to previous estimates. The AEO 2017 projections showed greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. A study by Resources for the Future found a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs in three primary ways, including revising estimates of the SCC. The EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs compared to the 2015 analysis. These changes included revising estimates of the SCC, excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future benefits of CO2 reductions, and counting demand-side energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes accounted for differences in conclusions between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. The EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs compared to the 2015 analysis. These changes included revising estimates of the SCC, excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future benefits of CO2 reductions, and counting demand-side energy efficiency savings as benefits. EPA and other federal agencies have used the SCC to value the climate benefits of CO2 reductions from rulemakings. The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions in a given year, including changes in energy system costs. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from changes in CO2 emissions in a given year. It includes changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. SCC values are calculated using models and multiplied by estimated CO2 emissions reductions to determine the monetary value of climate benefits. In 2015, the EPA estimated the climate benefits of the Clean Power Plan using SCC values ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the Clean Power Plan using SCC values ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 as part of E.O. 13783, directing agencies to ensure new estimates are consistent with OMB. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates and disbanded the IWG as part of E.O. 13783, which directed agencies to review federal requirements for domestic energy development. E.O. 13783 instructed agencies to use OMB Circular A-4 for new estimates, focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA developed new SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using similar models and assumptions as the IWG but with different scope and discount rates. The EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using similar models as the IWG but with different scope and discount rates. The domestic SCC estimates from three models are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2. EPA approximated the domestic SCC as 10% of the global SCC. The EPA approximated the domestic SCC as 10% of the global SCC, resulting in interim estimates of $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. Stakeholders have debated whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values due to the impact on global climate and economies. GHG concentrations impact global climate and have consequences for humans, economies, and natural systems worldwide. Stakeholders have debated whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values due to the interconnected nature of the global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, international trade, and public health. EPA agreed with this rationale in 2015. EPA agreed with the IWG's rationale in 2015 to use global SCC estimates due to the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, international trade, and public health. Stakeholders supported the use of global values, stating that a domestic SCC would understate benefits to the United States. Those recommending global values argued that there is no clear distinction between domestic and global climate change impacts. Some stakeholders disagreed with using global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates for U.S. climate regulations, arguing that it would overstate benefits and questioned its impact on international climate mitigation efforts. They recommended using domestic SCC estimates in line with OMB Circular A-4 guidance. Some stakeholders criticized using global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates for U.S. climate regulations, arguing that it overstates benefits and questioned its impact on international climate mitigation efforts. The EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in line with OMB Circular A-4 guidance, which emphasizes benefits and costs for U.S. citizens and residents. EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in line with OMB Circular A-4 guidance, which emphasizes benefits and costs for U.S. citizens and residents. Global estimates were presented as part of a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, but not compared to the avoided costs of the proposed repeal. Challenges in developing accurate estimates of the domestic SCC were acknowledged, including capturing relevant regional interactions. Experts and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine acknowledge challenges in accurately estimating the domestic Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). EPA and OMB Circular A-4 discuss the difficulty in capturing relevant regional interactions, such as global migration and economic destabilization, in estimating the SCC. Circular A-4 provides discount rate recommendations of 3% and 7% based on scenarios where regulations impact consumer spending or private capital. The OMB Circular A-4 provides discount rate recommendations of 3% and 7% based on scenarios where regulations impact consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate is based on the average saver's rate of discounting future consumption, while the 7% rate is based on the opportunity cost of capital. The discount rate for Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculations is crucial, with recommendations of 3% and 7% based on consumer spending and private capital impact. Discounting allows for comparing economic impacts occurring at different times, essential for benefit-cost analysis. The intergenerational aspect of climate change adds complexity to selecting a discount rate for SCC calculations. The selection of a discount rate for Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculations is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. The current generation must choose a discount rate on behalf of future generations without their input, raising questions about accounting for future preferences. While there is no consensus on the appropriate rate in an intergenerational context, it is crucial to consider higher discount rates. The selection of a discount rate for Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculations is crucial in an intergenerational context. Higher discount rates result in lower present values, while lower discount rates result in higher present values. OMB Circular A-4 recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates, acknowledging ethical implications in comparing benefits and costs across generations. The OMB Circular A-4 recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates for Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculations. The Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama Administration suggested reducing the 3% rate to at most 2% and lowering the 7% rate as well. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental and public interest groups advocating for lower rates. Stakeholders have divergent views on discount rate selection for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). Environmental and public interest groups recommend lower rates or rates that decline over time, while industry groups prefer higher rates like 7%. The majority of climate change impact studies use rates of no more than 5%, according to the National Academy of Sciences. The Interagency Working Group (IWG) in 2010 suggested that the SCC discount rate should reflect the average saver's consumption rate, not the 7% rate. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended new approaches to calculate discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), suggesting rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. The NAS emphasized the need for a method that captures uncertainty over long periods of time, diverging from the 7% rate based on the opportunity cost of capital. The NAS recommended new approaches to calculate discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), emphasizing the need for a method that captures uncertainty over long periods of time. They did not recommend a specific rate but focused on the method federal agencies should use. The NAS suggested that the OMB Circular A-4 guidance is insufficient for choosing SCC discount rates. EPA estimated lower climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates compared to their 2015 analysis. The EPA estimated lower climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, which produced notably lower benefit estimates than their 2015 analysis. The use of a 7% discount rate in the 2017 analysis lowered the SCC estimates and reduced the estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. EPA acknowledged the limitations of the interim SCC estimates and conducted a sensitivity analysis with respect to the scope and discount rate. The EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on the climate benefit estimates of the proposed repeal, including global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The 2017 analysis excluded some human health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal excluded some human health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons, diverging from the 2015 analysis. Different benefit-cost comparisons either included, excluded, or reduced the forgone health co-benefits, with one comparison focusing solely on CO2 benefits. This approach was seen as inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal excluded some human health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons, diverging from the 2015 analysis. One comparison focused solely on CO2 benefits, which was seen as inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. EPA requested public comment on the extent to which benefits due to reductions in the target pollutant should be considered in decision-making. The EPA requested public comment on the consideration of benefits relative to costs in regulatory decision-making, specifically regarding co-benefits from reduced exposure to pollutants. Stakeholders raised concerns about potential double counting of benefits in EPA's analysis, questioning the attribution of benefits to specific regulations. EPA's 2015 analysis clarified that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations. EPA's 2015 analysis clarified that human health co-benefits from the CPP were incremental to existing regulations, following federal guidance to consider co-benefits in benefit-cost analysis. The EPA and OMB guidelines recommend considering co-benefits and adverse impacts in economic analyses of regulations, particularly in Clean Air Act analyses where co-benefits play a significant role in total benefits estimates. The EPA and OMB guidelines emphasize considering co-benefits and adverse impacts in economic analyses of regulations, especially in Clean Air Act analyses where co-benefits are crucial in estimating total benefits. OMB noted that the estimated benefits of EPA rules under the Clean Air Act are mainly due to reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter, following standard accounting practices required by OMB Circular A-4. EPA's recent benefit-cost comparisons only included some forgone health co-benefits, applying a threshold to count only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. This diverged from past practice by assuming zero health co-benefits for PM reductions beyond the threshold. The EPA used thresholds to calculate PM mortality impacts in their 2017 analysis, assuming no deaths below certain levels of PM concentration. One threshold was based on the federal air quality standard for PM (12 \u03bcg/m3), while the second was based on the lowest measured level from two long-term studies (5.8 \u03bcg/m3 and 8 \u03bcg/m3). This approach differed from past practices and only considered co-benefits exceeding the defined thresholds for ambient PM levels. The EPA used thresholds based on PM concentration levels from long-term studies to estimate deaths related to PM. The PM air quality standard served as a higher threshold, lowering the forgone co-benefit estimates more than the lowest measured level threshold. Benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal were more favorable when using the PM air quality standard threshold compared to the LML threshold. EPA explained the use of these thresholds as a way to assess the benefits outweighing the costs. The EPA used thresholds based on PM concentration levels to estimate deaths related to PM. Benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal were more favorable with the PM air quality standard threshold than the LML threshold. EPA justified the use of these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty of estimated PM benefits. The EPA justified using PM concentration thresholds to estimate mortality benefits, citing uncertainty and greater confidence in certain concentration ranges. Scientific evidence shows no clear threshold for PM-related health risks, with studies supporting a no-threshold model for mortality concentration-response relationship. EPA's analysis in 2015 acknowledged lower confidence in benefits. The EPA's 2009 Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter found that a no-threshold model best represents the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. In 2015, the EPA acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold. The agency stated that federal air quality standards are not risk-free, indicating some health risks even at compliant pollution levels. The 2015 analysis concluded that benefits exist both above and below the federal standard levels, aligning with scientific evidence and reviews from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. EPA's 2017 analysis further supported these findings. EPA's 2017 analysis aims to evaluate the uncertainty of the benefit-per-ton approach for estimating health impacts of pollutants like PM. They plan to conduct detailed air quality modeling to inform threshold-based analysis of PM benefits. The EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis. They moved the energy savings from the cost side to the benefits side, increasing both estimated costs and benefits by the same amount. The EPA's 2017 analysis treated energy efficiency savings as a benefit, following OMB guidance. In the proposed repeal analysis, energy savings were removed from total cost estimate and added to benefits estimate, resulting in larger cost and benefits estimates. This accounting change did not alter the difference between benefits and costs. The EPA's accounting change in the proposed repeal analysis resulted in higher estimates of the CPP's costs and benefits, without altering the net impact. This change became more significant in a cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771, leading to separate presentation of results in the 2017 regulatory analysis. EPA presented the results of its E.O. 13771 analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, focusing on cost savings of the proposed repeal but omitting the forgone benefits. Compliance costs analyzed under E.O. 13771 exceeded the compliance costs of the Clean Power Plan. The present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033, using the power sector modeling from EPA's 2015 analysis, exceeded the compliance costs considered in the 2015 benefit-cost analysis. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by providing a framework for evaluating regulatory options, but it does not solely determine decisions. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by providing a framework for evaluating regulatory options, but it does not solely determine decisions. Decisionmakers consider qualitative impacts, legal considerations, technical feasibility, statutory criteria, and ethical considerations when finalizing regulatory proposals. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of a proposed regulation can be complex. EPA based the proposed CPP repeal on a change in legal interpretation and must adhere to rulemaking procedures. EPA's benefit-cost analysis plays a crucial role in shaping regulatory proposals, considering various factors like legal interpretations and rulemaking procedures. The analysis involves complex tasks like quantifying benefits and costs, drawing on scientific data, and making policy-based decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can significantly impact the estimation of benefits and costs, as seen in the differences between EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal. The proposed repeal highlights how changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence benefit-cost analysis. EPA's 2017 analysis differed from the 2015 analysis due to new SCC estimates and thresholds affecting climate and human health benefits. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations like the CPP. Regulatory decisions, such as the CPP repeal, can impact major industries. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations like the CPP, which can impact major industries. EPA's 2017 analysis used \"interim\" SCC estimates developed in response to E.O. 13783, characterizing the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates as \"no longer representative of governmental policy.\" The EPA's 2017 analysis of the CPP benefits and costs reflects differences in policy priorities between the Trump and Obama Administrations. The interim SCC estimates used in the analysis deviated from the IWG's methodology, particularly in the scope of estimates and discount rates, leading to lower estimated climate benefits of the proposed repeal. The withdrawal of IWG SCC estimates may result in differences across federal agencies in GHG-related regulatory decisions. Congress may need to consider the impact of withdrawing the IWG SCC estimates on federal agencies' decisions regarding GHG-related regulations. EPA's 2017 analysis did not provide clear next steps for the SCC or implications for other federal analyses, leaving uncertainty about whether agencies will use the same interim estimates in their regulatory analyses. The EPA's 2017 analysis did not provide a timeline for updates on the impacts of climate change to the U.S. Other agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have followed a similar approach, while the Department of Energy continued to use the IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking. Congress may need to consider the changes to the health co-benefits analysis by the EPA and how it could impact future air pollution rulemakings. The EPA's 2017 analysis reflected different policy determinations in health co-benefits compared to the 2015 analysis. The 2017 analysis used a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts, departing from previous analyses. The exclusion of health co-benefits from one benefit-cost comparison differed from federal guidance. The 2017 EPA analysis departed from previous approaches by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts and excluding health co-benefits from one benefit-cost comparison, contrary to federal guidance and the 2015 analysis."
