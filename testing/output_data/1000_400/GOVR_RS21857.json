U.S. foreign investment policy has historically supported and promoted foreign direct investment, but national security concerns have led to new measures restricting foreign investment in some countries. Countries have adopted new measures to restrict foreign investment due to security-related concerns. The United States addresses national security concerns through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees foreign investment in U.S. firms to assess national security implications and can block transactions that threaten national security. It is a voluntary process that can lead to future reviews and possible divestiture if firms do not notify CFIUS of impending investment transactions. The President can block foreign investment transactions that threaten national security. CFIUS process is voluntary but firms risk future review and divestiture if they don't notify CFIUS. 42% of notified transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in manufacturing, with computer and electronic products being the most common sectors. Within the manufacturing sector, computer and electronic products accounted for over 40% of investment transactions notified to CFIUS. The transportation equipment and machinery sectors followed closely behind. Investment transactions in the services sector made up half of the total in the finance, information, and services category. Concerns are rising over the economic and security implications of foreign government-owned firms, known as state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The OECD estimates that 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are now effectively controlled by foreign governments. The international presence and investment activity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) owned or controlled by foreign governments are causing concerns over economic and security implications. The OECD reports that 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are now under state control, the highest in decades. Policymakers worry about preferential treatment given to SOEs, potentially creating competitive advantages and anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. This association may provide market protection and access to below-market financing, giving these firms a competitive edge. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) owned or controlled by foreign governments are raising concerns over their overseas activities potentially creating anticompetitive effects. Close associations between firms and governments may blur the line between commercial activities and those driven by public policy goals, leading to worries about compromising national security objectives. Policymakers are divided on whether SOEs, protected by their governments, may have an unfair advantage in the global marketplace. Some policymakers are concerned that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) controlled by foreign governments may compromise national security objectives through their foreign investment activities. However, the OECD has found little evidence that SOEs' advantages affect their international economic performance. By the end of 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with more than 32,000 foreign affiliates, while foreign firms had over 6,600 affiliates operating in the United States.

The affiliates of foreign firms in the United States spent $248 billion on new plants and equipment in 2014, imported $735 billion in goods, and exported $434 billion in goods. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy has increased eight-fold since 1980, reaching 6.4% of GDP. The performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to U.S.-owned counterparts shows a mixed picture, with historically lower rates of return that have narrowed over time. Foreign-owned establishments in the United States historically had lower rates of return compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time. This improvement is attributed to age effects and startup costs that diminish over time. Despite accounting for less than 3% of all U.S. manufacturing establishments, foreign-owned manufacturing firms outperform their U.S. counterparts with significantly higher value added and shipments. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. have higher value added and shipments compared to U.S. counterparts. They have larger plant sizes, pay higher wages, and have higher productivity and output per worker. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. have higher wages, productivity, and output per worker compared to U.S. counterparts. These differences should be viewed with caution due to factors like plant scale and age, as well as the size and nature of the firms in each group. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. have higher wages, productivity, and output per worker compared to U.S. counterparts. The differences are due to factors like plant scale, firm size, and the nature of investments. Foreign firms investing in the U.S. are typically large with proven technologies, opting for larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. increased significantly in 2015 compared to 2013. Foreign direct investment in the United States rose sharply in 2015, reflecting a growing economy and rising equity values. Globally, foreign direct investment inflows increased by 38% in 2015 to reach $1.7 trillion, but have not yet recovered to pre-financial-crisis levels. Some regions, like Africa and parts of Latin America, experienced a slowdown in foreign direct investment inflows in 2015. Global foreign direct investment flows have not fully recovered from pre-financial-crisis levels, with many regions experiencing a slowdown in 2015. As the U.S. economy improves, interest rates remain low, and inflation stays in check, foreign direct investment in the United States is expected to increase. Public concerns over globalization's impact on jobs will be crucial. Estimates suggest that foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy may slightly increase in 2016 compared to 2015. Concerns over globalization's impact on jobs, particularly related to mergers and acquisitions, are important. Job losses could occur regardless of whether the acquiring company is foreign or U.S.-owned, but benefits from capital inflow and potential job creation are also recognized. Despite concerns over job losses from mergers and acquisitions, foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy remains strong, with some national security concerns raised but not deterring foreign investors. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy remains strong despite national security concerns post-9/11 attacks. The U.S. economy is a prime destination for foreign investments, with the pace of economic growth attracting new investments and encouraging existing firms to reinvest profits in their U.S. operations."
