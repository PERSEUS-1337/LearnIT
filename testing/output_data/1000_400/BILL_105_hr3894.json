    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Air Force Science and Technology Reinvigoration Act\" and includes findings related to the Air Force. Congress finds that the Air Force was established with a focus on scientific research and technology development for aeronautical defenses. Scientific investigation is crucial for air, space, and information superiority, requiring a strong research base. The vision of building the Air Force around science, as envisioned by General Henry H. Arnold, remains essential today. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, particularly the aerospace sector, and has made significant contributions to the economy. The Sense of Congress regarding the science and technology functions of the Department of the Air Force is highlighted in Section 3. Congress emphasizes the need for dedicated funding for emerging technologies within the Air Force, separate from acquisition funding. A minimum of 15 percent of science and technology funds should be invested in new technology areas for the next 5 years to meet future challenges. To maintain technological advancement, the Air Force should invest in new technology areas, increase the number of officers with technical doctorate degrees, expand technical master's degrees, and eliminate stagnation in science and technology efforts. To ensure Air Force science and technology advancement, efforts should be made to eliminate 5 percent of programs each year and redirect funds to new programs. This includes granting master's degrees to Air Force officers and civilian employees. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. The text chunk discusses the separation of research and development functions within the Department of the Air Force, including amending sections related to the Secretary of the Air Force and the establishment of an Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology. The text chunk amends sections related to the establishment of an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology, including changes in subsections and the overall supervision of science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force. The text chunk establishes the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology within the Department of the Air Force. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council to study the Air Force's technology base, recommending minimum requirements for maintaining superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology. The study will also address the effects of reduced funding on national defense and recommend appropriate staffing levels. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council to study the Air Force's technology base, recommending minimum requirements for maintaining superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology. The study will also address the effects of reduced funding on national defense and recommend appropriate staffing levels, including the optimal ratio of civilian and military staff with baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 120 days."
