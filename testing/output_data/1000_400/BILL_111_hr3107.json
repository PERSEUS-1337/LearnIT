The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 to promote atomic energy for peaceful purposes and prevent military use. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's budget. The Technical Cooperation Program provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes to countries worldwide. The IAEA established the Technical Cooperation Program in 1959, funded by member states, to provide nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. The United States is the largest contributor to the program. A 2009 GAO report highlighted that assistance is not limited to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The IAEA limits Technical Cooperation assistance to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, including Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. These countries received over $55 million in assistance from 1997 to 2007 and over $4.4 million in 2008. Proliferation concerns persist due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and technology provided through the program. The Technical Cooperation Program has raised proliferation concerns due to its assistance to certain countries like Iran, where projects were directly related to nuclear power plants. The dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and technology provided through the program makes it challenging for the United States to fully assess and resolve these concerns. The United States faces challenges in identifying and resolving proliferation concerns related to the Technical Cooperation Program due to lack of formal mechanisms for obtaining project information, limited State documentation on how concerns were addressed, and shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures. The program does not exclude countries based on their status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism or political considerations. The GAO report highlighted that the Technical Cooperation Program does not exclude countries based on their status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism or political considerations. The report also raised concerns about the limited information available on TC projects and the potential for TC assistance to advance weapons of mass destruction. The GAO report raised concerns about the limited information available on TC projects and the potential for TC assistance to advance weapons of mass destruction in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The report also questioned the State Department's confidence in IAEA's safeguards to prevent TC projects from contributing to weapons development. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and subsequent Acts prohibited funds for TC projects in certain countries like Libya, Iran, Cuba, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998, also restricted funds for IAEA projects in Cuba. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 mandated the U.S. to withhold funding to the IAEA if necessary. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 required the U.S. to withhold funding for IAEA projects in Cuba related to the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. The GAO report suggested withholding a share of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries of concern. The U.S. is required to withhold funding for IAEA projects in countries of concern, including Iran, due to their violations of UN Security Council Resolutions regarding heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. Technical cooperation with Iran should only be for humanitarian purposes according to UN Resolution 1737 (2006). The UN Security Council Resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), and 1835 (2008) restrict technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes only. Iran has approximately 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, with a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. The Government of Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium, running almost 5,000 of them, and has increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to over 1,300 kilograms, enough for further enrichment into high-enriched uranium for an atomic bomb. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA Director General has repeatedly reported concerns about Iran's nuclear program, including the lack of implementation of the Additional Protocol and access to key locations for transparency measures. Iran has repeatedly requested Iran to provide access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing, uranium enrichment research, and mining as a transparency measure. The IAEA Director General has reported Iran's lack of cooperation on issues concerning possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, leading to no substantive progress. Iran has also refused to comply with resolutions adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors. Iran has repeatedly denied access to its nuclear facilities and refused to comply with IAEA resolutions, raising concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Iran recently denied access to its enrichment site at Natanz and blocked IAEA inspections, violating its NPT Safeguards Agreement. Iran recently denied access to its Natanz enrichment site and refused to allow additional surveillance cameras, violating its NPT Safeguards Agreement. In April 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was constructing a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour capable of producing plutonium for weapons, which was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour, based on a North Korean model, was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. General Michael Hayden stated it could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor in November 2008. The Syrian facility at Dair Alzour was suspected of being an undeclared nuclear reactor. Syria did not provide requested documentation or allow access to other locations for inspection by the IAEA. The nature of the destroyed facility could not be determined, and uranium particles were found at another site in Damascus. The Agency has not been able to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour site. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, which were not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. The Agency has not been able to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour site. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, which were not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions within 30 days of this Act's enactment. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent on assistance to countries under investigation for breaching nuclear agreements. If not done within 30 days, assessed contributions will also be withheld. If the Secretary of State does not withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA within 30 days of the enactment of this Act, an amount equal to the specified in subsection (b) will be withheld from the United States assessed contribution to the IAEA. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies these countries no longer pose a threat. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. REPORT. SEC. 5. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. REPORT. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" defines a country whose government has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism."
