    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 as part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation accidents. In 1974, the Independent Safety Board Act made the NTSB independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main functions include determining accident causes and recommending safety improvements to prevent future accidents. The NTSB, independent of DOT since 1974, investigates accidents, determines causes, and recommends safety improvements. It does not regulate safety practices, which fall under DOT's jurisdiction. The agency consists of a five-member board and around 420 staff, primarily based in Washington, DC. The NTSB, independent of DOT since 1974, investigates accidents, determines causes, and recommends safety improvements. It consists of a five-member board and around 420 staff, primarily based in Washington, DC. The NTSB also has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK, as well as a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee in every state located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office for initial investigative response to accidents. This impacts Hawaii, where the NTSB does not have a field office. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 mandates the NTSB to have at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from a regional office for accident response. This affects Hawaii, where the NTSB lacks a field office. Currently, the NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii, and the board members serve five-year terms with a limit on political party representation. The NTSB board members, appointed with Senate consent, serve five-year terms and can continue until replacements are appointed. No more than three members can be from the same party, and at least three must have technical qualifications. Investigative staff are organized by transportation mode, with a court of appeals function for airmen and mariners. The NTSB also has an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications. The NTSB serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. It also has an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications that tracks responses to safety recommendations, coordinates communications with stakeholders, and investigates transportation accidents and safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, railroad accidents with passenger trains, pipeline accidents, major marine casualties, and other catastrophic accidents related to transportation safety. The NTSB investigates major marine casualties on U.S. waters or involving U.S.-flag vessels, along with other transportation safety issues. It relies on experts from various fields and uses a party process to assist with investigations, ensuring independence in its findings. The NTSB uses a party process to assist with investigations, ensuring independence in its findings. Interested parties can provide technical expertise and submit analyses for consideration, but NTSB bases its conclusions strictly on its own staff's analysis and recommendations. Formal procedures exist for parties to petition NTSB to reconsider findings after the final report is adopted. The NTSB has formal procedures for parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings. The Safety Board must meet publicly on most matters related to accident investigations, and members must disclose financial interests in transportation-related companies. Despite safeguards, parties can still influence the NTSB process. The NTSB has procedures for parties to petition for reconsideration of findings. Board members must disclose financial interests in transportation companies. Despite safeguards, outside influence on investigations is possible, affecting the agency's credibility. Balancing unique data from parties with impartiality is a challenge. Competing perspectives in complex investigations can prolong the process. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality during complex accident investigations, balancing unique expertise from involved parties while avoiding outside influence. The agency follows international standards for aviation accident investigations and may assist in foreign investigations upon request, even without a vested interest. The NTSB may assist in foreign aviation accident investigations, even without a vested interest, and may be reimbursed for costs incurred. This provision was included in P.L. 109-443, allowing for offsetting collections from outside entities. The NTSB can receive offsetting collections for fees and reimbursements, including costs from foreign aviation accident investigations covered by the Safe Skies for Africa program. They issue safety recommendations to influence transportation safety practices. The NTSB receives funding ranging from just under $1 million to almost $2.4 million annually, with some costs covered by the Safe Skies for Africa program. They issue safety recommendations to regulators, operators, and users of transportation systems, leading to safety improvements. Since 1967, over 14,300 safety recommendations have been issued, with about 82% resulting in implemented safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond to each recommendation within 90 days. Since 1967, the NTSB has issued over 14,300 safety recommendations to various recipients in transportation. About 82% of these recommendations have led to implemented safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond to each recommendation within 90 days, detailing their implementation plans. The NTSB advocates for transportation safety improvements to build public support, even though adoption of recommendations is not mandatory. Implementation may be delayed due to lengthy rulemaking processes and feasibility concerns. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, advocating for their implementation. Implementation may be delayed due to lengthy processes and feasibility concerns. The NTSB does not consider cost in developing recommendations and highlights key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list. The NTSB issues safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list for transportation safety improvements, including actions to reduce fatigue-related accidents, improve rail transit safety oversight, promote collision avoidance technologies, strengthen occupant protection, minimize operator distractions, prevent loss of control in flight, end substance impairment, and require operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations typically request action from DOT and states. The NTSB issues safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list for transportation safety improvements, including actions to reduce fatigue-related accidents, improve rail transit safety oversight, promote collision avoidance technologies, strengthen occupant protection, minimize operator distractions, prevent loss of control in flight, end substance impairment, and require operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations typically request action from DOT and states. NTSB's safety recommendations and advocacy programs have influenced regulatory agenda and congressional decision-making on transportation safety issues, leading to legislative and regulatory changes such as positive train control systems, reduced airline pilot fatigue, distracted driving laws, safety standards for helicopter air ambulances, and pipeline safety improvements. The NTSB's influence on congressional decision-making and oversight of transportation safety issues is evident in legislation requiring positive train control systems, regulations to reduce airline pilot fatigue, state laws on distracted driving, federal safety standards for helicopter air ambulances, and improved pipeline safety standards. For example, provisions in the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 draw on NTSB investigations and recommendations, such as setting deadlines for implementing an airline pilot records database and modifying pilot training to ensure skills in monitoring automated systems and controlling flight paths without autopilot. The NTSB has influenced legislation to implement an industrywide airline pilot records database and modify pilot training to ensure skills in monitoring automated systems and controlling flight paths without autopilot. This was prompted by concerns raised after pilot-involved accidents, such as the Asiana Airlines crash in 2013 and the Germanwings suicide downing in 2015. The FAA is directed to assess recommendations for mental health screening for pilots. The FAA is directed to assess recommendations for mental health screening for pilots, following international aviation safety concerns raised after the Germanwings suicide downing in 2015. Additionally, the FAA is mandated to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems, in response to NTSB safety recommendations. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, and increasing penalties for safety violations. It also mandated reviews of diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 aimed to improve pipeline safety by increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying maximum allowable operating pressure, increasing penalties for violations, and reviewing diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by human error. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system identified by the NTSB to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, reducing incidents due to speed, conflicting movements, and failure to obey signals. The NTSB also prioritizes minimizing operator distractions to improve safety, with Congress establishing a distracted driving grant program in 2012 to discourage texting and cell-phone use while driving. Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012 to discourage texting and cell-phone use while driving. States had to prohibit texting for all drivers and cell-phone use for drivers under 18 as primary violations to qualify for a grant. A provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. Only one state qualified for a grant under this program in FY2014 and FY2015. In 2015, a provision in the FAST Act removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. Funding for the NTSB includes a base authorization, emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations like TWA flight 800. The NTSB has a set-aside emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs and supplemental appropriations for large investigations like TWA flight 800. The existing statute allows for up to $4 million in the emergency fund, but it has not been used in over a decade. The GAO evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities. The NTSB has not used its emergency fund or sought supplemental appropriations in over a decade. The GAO evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, including information management, resource management, workforce development, and accident investigations. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and has fully implemented recommendations in the past. In 2013, GAO revisited NTSB management practices, finding improvements but areas needing further enhancement like training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. GAO recommended developing a strategy for maximizing the NTSB's cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, and safety concerns. The NTSB is working on maximizing the utility of its cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, safety concerns, recoverability of vehicle recorders, privacy of data collected, and potential use of recorder data for accident investigation. Legislation in the 114th Congress addresses NTSB funding for railroad accident investigations. The NTSB has requested a staff increase to carry out its mission, with staffing increasing by 12% over the past decade. A five-year strategic human capital plan aims to address competency gaps and workforce diversity. Limited resources have led to extended accident investigations and the failure to investigate some pipeline accidents. The NTSB's strategic human capital plan aims to address competency gaps, assure leadership succession, and increase workforce diversity. Limited resources have led to extended accident investigations and the failure to investigate some pipeline accidents and a large number of railroad accidents, especially fatal grade crossing and trespasser accidents. Congress may debate whether additional staffing is needed to meet the statutory requirement for the NTSB to investigate all fatal railroad accidents. The NTSB faces staffing challenges in investigating fatal railroad accidents, with concerns about retirements and skill gaps. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing and ways to recruit and retain field investigators and specialists. The NTSB's Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials is particularly affected by staffing shortages. The NTSB has staffing challenges in its Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB Training Center was completed in 2003 at George Washington University, but concerns remain about its costs and benefits. The NTSB was required to develop a plan for the center to achieve financial self-sufficiency, but this has not been accomplished. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, completed in 2003, has struggled to achieve financial self-sufficiency despite its primary purpose of training NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel. Revenues from training fees and safety-related meetings have not covered the facility's costs. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, established in 2003, has faced financial challenges despite its focus on training NTSB staff and industry personnel. Revenues from training fees and safety meetings have not been sufficient to cover costs. The center has relied on leases and rentals for additional income, but struggles to fully recover expenses. A 2006 GAO study raised concerns about the center's financial sustainability. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, established in 2003, has financial challenges. A 2006 GAO study highlighted difficulties in increasing revenues or reducing costs to offset the training center's expenses. The NTSB violated the Anti-Deficiency Act by leasing the facility as an operating lease without budget authority for the full term. Possible solutions include renegotiating the lease, obtaining deficiency appropriation, or vacating the space. The GAO identified possible remedies for the financial challenges of the NTSB Training Center, including obtaining a deficiency appropriation, renegotiating the lease, terminating the lease, or obligating lease payments annually. GAO suggested vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy, but the potential benefits of the facility were not fully considered. Congressional oversight and legislation may be needed to address the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center. Utilization of the center has improved, with classroom usage increasing from less than 20% before FY2007 to over 60% since FY2009, and the NTSB has leased some unutilized nonclassroom space, resulting in increased revenue. The NTSB Training Center has improved its utilization and cost recovery, with classroom usage increasing to over 60% since FY2009. Lease revenue has also contributed to the improved financial situation, reducing the annual operating deficit. However, the facility still does not fully recoup its operating costs. Congressional oversight may be necessary to address the financial challenges, but significant changes may be limited before the expiration of the NTSB's lease agreement. Data and voice recorders have been essential tools in aviation investigations since the 1960s. The NTSB Training Center has improved utilization and cost recovery, but still does not fully recoup operating costs. Congress may have limited ability to make changes before the lease agreement expires. Data recorders are crucial for aviation investigations, but challenges exist in recovering them promptly after accidents and concerns about privacy. Recovery of recorders has been difficult in recent accidents, such as Air France flight 447. The challenges in recovering data recorders after aviation accidents have raised concerns about privacy and public disclosures. Recent incidents, like Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804, have highlighted the difficulties in retrieving recorders from deep-sea locations. Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which went missing in 2014, still has not had its recorders recovered. The NTSB has issued recommendations for overwater flights to transmit data for safety purposes. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, and its recorders have not been found. The NTSB issued safety recommendations for overwater flights to transmit data on impact and underwater location. They also urged harmonization of technologies and regulations for location broadcasts and flight data transmissions. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 was introduced to address these issues. The NTSB worked with ICAO and foreign aviation authorities to harmonize technologies and regulations for location broadcasts and flight data transmissions. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aimed to equip certain large passenger aircraft with continuous tracking technology and automatic deployable flight recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 raised concerns about locating maritime voyage data recorders. The bill aims to improve the recovery of flight data and cockpit voice recorders, following the sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015. The vessel's data recorder, located at a depth of 15,000 feet, was recovered 10 months after the accident. Certain passenger and cargo vessels are required to carry voyage data recorders under SOLAS regulations, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. Under SOLAS regulations, certain vessels must carry voyage data recorders, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. New regulations require new ships to have both types of recorders with enhanced data capture capabilities. Concerns over data recovery from vessels lost in deep water may lead to potential options for assisting investigators. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding the recovery or survivability characteristics of maritime voyage data recorders, but concerns over data recovery may prompt congressional interest in potential options to assist investigators. Event recorders are aiding accident investigators in various modes of transportation, raising questions about privacy and the use of data outside investigative proceedings. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data recorded by event data recorders in passenger vehicles. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data recorded by event data recorders in passenger vehicles, raising concerns about privacy and potential misuse of the data. The bill aims to restrict access to data recorded by event data recorders in passenger vehicles for privacy reasons and to investigate the causes of motor vehicle crashes. It also requires a study on the appropriate amount of time data recorders should capture vehicle-related data. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all required railroad accidents, prompting interest in safety recommendations. Legislation specifies funding for railroad accident investigations. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 (S. 1732) authorizes appropriations to the NTSB for railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. It also directs a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
