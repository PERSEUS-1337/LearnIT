    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, along with the companion CRS Report RL30795, aims to identify and describe key general management laws governing the executive branch. It assists Congress in overseeing executive branch management and considering potential changes to management laws and legislation. The compendium profiles selected general management laws crucial for maintaining accountability. The compendium contains profiles of selected \"general management laws\" crucial for maintaining accountability in the executive branch. These laws influence federal agencies' effectiveness in implementing public policies. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to the general management laws. The companion report complements the compendium by highlighting major themes and management policy options for Congress regarding general management laws. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories, reflecting the status of these laws at the end of the first session of the 108th Congress. The compendium includes over 90 entries categorized into seven functional areas: Information and Regulatory Management, Strategic Planning, Performance Measurement, Financial Management, Organization, Procurement and Real Property Management, Intergovernmental Relations Management, and Human Resources Management and Ethics. The focus is on specific laws, with the Human Resources Management and Ethics section highlighting civil service laws in Title 5 of the United States Code. The report provides a detailed overview of various laws related to management in different functional areas such as finance, production, and human resources. Each entry in the compendium includes a brief history of the law, major provisions, key developments, and source readings for further information. Additionally, the report discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch in both public and private sectors. The report provides historical background on the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. It discusses the comparison between management in public and private sectors and analyzes major themes in general management laws. Scholars debate the constitutional roles of Congress and the President in managing federal agencies. The roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch have been a subject of debate among scholars. The U.S. Constitution established a system of separated powers and checks and balances, with both branches sharing power in managing federal agencies. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the interdependence and reciprocity between the branches in governing the executive branch. The Constitution establishes separated powers and checks and balances between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Congress has the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws necessary for executing their powers. This report and compendium examine the shared power dynamics between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. The Constitution grants legislative powers to Congress and executive powers to the President, with checks and balances in place. Congress has the authority to make laws necessary for executing their powers, while the President is tasked with ensuring laws are faithfully executed. The President's power is limited, and their duty is to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions without frustrating congressional intention. The President's duty is to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions without frustrating congressional intention. Article II mentions the President's power to require written opinions from executive department officers and appoint heads of departments. In 1789, Congress enacted laws establishing the Treasury Department and federal financial management system. In 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and set salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury, State, and War. By the end of the 18th century, only three departments, the Navy Department, the office of Attorney General, and the Post Office had been created. Elected officials faced challenges in administering the growing federal government after the nation's founding. After the nation's founding, elected officials faced challenges in administering the growing federal government. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive, effective delegation of authority, and a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, largely continued this framework. Congress became more involved in the administrative system. After the nation's founding, the Federalists established an administrative system with delegation of authority and a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, continued this framework. Congress became more involved in the administrative system, and federal employment increased significantly from 1816 to 1861. The organization of executive departments also became more complex over time. The organization of executive departments in government administration became more complex over time, with federal employment rising from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861. Departments in 1860 consisted of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service, compared to simpler structures in 1800. Post-Civil War developments, such as industrialization and the Progressive era, further impacted government administration. The growth of the administrative state after the Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch. By 1946, Congress delegated much legislative authority to administrative agencies, shifting policy-making and budgeting to the executive branch. By 1946, Congress had delegated legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to a shift in policy-making and budgeting to the executive branch. Observers noted that Congress relied on agencies' discretion and technical expertise for formulating public policies, sometimes allowing agencies to exercise legislative powers. In response, Congress expanded general management laws to improve executive branch management practices, increasing transparency through legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act. Congress expanded general management laws to address various aspects of the executive branch, increasing transparency through legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act (1946), the Freedom of Information Act (1966), and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972). Additionally, Congress established inspectors general in 1978, enacted the Congressional Review of Regulations Act, and required agency strategic planning with the Government Performance and Results Act in 1993 to improve oversight and accountability. Congress expanded general management laws to increase transparency and oversight in the executive branch. This included establishing inspectors general, enacting the Congressional Review of Regulations Act, and requiring agency strategic planning. Congress also sought to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. Additional laws were passed to improve agencies' financial management. Overall, these laws can be seen as necessary legislative action to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the debate over general management laws and their impact on executive branch agencies. It questions whether these laws are necessary for disciplined management or if they hinder flexibility and initiative. The conclusion depends on the viewpoint of the questioner and the situation at hand. Numerous potentially controversial issues remain for Congress to consider. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison between management practices in the public and private sectors, highlighting similarities, differences, and the caution recommended by scholars. Management practices in the public and private sectors are compared, with scholars cautioning against applying private-sector principles to government agencies. Key differences, such as operating under different laws, are highlighted. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre's aphorism emphasizes the fundamental similarities between public and private management in unimportant respects. Public-sector agencies and private-sector companies operate under different sets of laws to regulate behaviors for different purposes. The government has coercive power under the Constitution and public law, while private companies operate under laws to regulate a functioning market economy. Federal government agencies must act under authority provided in public law, established by Congress, the President, and the courts. Private companies operate under laws like antitrust and financial regulations. Government agencies operate under public law, formulated by Congress, the President, and the courts, authorizing their mission and operations. In contrast, private companies abide by laws regulating the market economy, without prescribing specific actions. Companies are primarily accountable to owners or shareholders, unlike government agencies. Government agencies differ from private sector organizations in various ways. Unlike private bureaucracies, government agencies cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over revenues, resources, and agency goals lies with external entities like legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. This necessitates agency managers to address the demands of these external entities, making it challenging to measure and build consensus on agency performance. Control over revenues, resources, and agency goals is vested in external entities like legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. Government faces challenges in measuring and building consensus on agency performance. The differences between public and private sector management practices raise public policy issues, with major themes emerging from general management laws that may prompt management policy options for Congress. The general management laws raise public policy issues for specific agencies and prompt management policy options for Congress. Congress often debates the level of discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions. Giving discretion can provide flexibility for tailoring laws to specific circumstances, but the extent of this discretion is a heavily debated topic. The level of discretion given to the executive branch in determining agency actions is a heavily debated topic. Some argue that it allows for flexibility in tailoring laws to specific circumstances, while others are concerned about decisions made without support from Congress. The level of discretion granted to the executive branch in agency actions is a contentious issue. Some believe it allows for flexibility in decision-making, while others are concerned about decisions made without congressional support. The President or agencies may have differing views from Congress and stakeholders, potentially leading to lack of oversight and accountability. Granting discretion can also empower unelected officials, raising transparency and accountability concerns. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to lack of oversight and accountability, as some argue that Congress may not have the resources or time to intervene in agency actions. This can put key decisions in the hands of unelected officials, raising concerns about transparency and political accountability. Congress faced this tension in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their human resources management systems. Similar situations arose in 1993 with the Clinton Administration's NPR recommendations and the passage of FASA in 1994. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for a delegation of authority to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce the risk of adverse consequences. This can help balance flexibility with accountability in regulatory decision-making. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for a delegation of authority to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce the risk of adverse consequences. This can help balance flexibility with accountability in regulatory decision-making. Options include contract design and screening mechanisms to improve agency performance. Congress can ensure effective delegation of authority to executive branch agencies by setting conditions, such as allowing agencies to retain unspent funds, implementing screening mechanisms to assess agency performance, and requiring monitoring and reporting to increase accountability and transparency. Congress can increase accountability and transparency by requiring agencies to report their actions, milestones, and obtained information. This can be done through monitoring and reporting requirements, utilizing information technology for real-time updates. However, some argue that excessive reporting can be burdensome and reports to Congress may not always be utilized effectively. The advent of information technology and the Web may enable real-time reporting to Congress, but some argue that excessive reporting can be burdensome. Institutional checks, such as involving additional agencies in decision-making, can help ensure accountability in agency actions. The tension between standardization and customization of management laws for agencies arises frequently for Congress. Should laws be standardized for all agencies or customized to each agency's specific needs? The tension between standardization and customization of management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch, as seen in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Congress has introduced standardization in financial management through the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. Standardization in the executive branch, such as through the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 and the CFO Act of 1990, promotes transparency and accountability. Congress has extended financial management standardization to various agencies, leading to improved audit outcomes. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act further expanded these requirements to other executive agencies, emphasizing the importance of accountability. The CFO Act of 1990 and the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 extended financial management standardization to executive agencies, promoting transparency and accountability. Customization can also be beneficial for effective management by aligning an agency's management with its internal and external environments. Congress uses various mechanisms to require specific actions from agencies, incorporating customization into general management laws. Customization in management laws allows Congress to require specific actions from agencies, aligning them with their internal and external environments. For example, small agencies were not previously required to prepare audited financial statements, and the CFO position at the Department of Homeland Security was exempt from CFO Act requirements. DHS and the DOD were granted authority to customize aspects of their HRM systems in recent years. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) exemplifies a mixed approach in management laws, balancing standardization with customization. This act required most executive branch agencies to comply with general management laws while allowing for some flexibility and exceptions. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) exemplifies a mixed approach in management laws, balancing standardization with customization. Congress can make exceptions to general management laws, allowing for flexibility within agencies. Standardization, customization, and mixed approaches in management laws can have advantages and disadvantages. While standardization can be too rigid, stifling creativity, customization may reduce transparency and accountability if not reported in real-time. Customization can also lead to agencies working at cross-purposes, causing budget pressures. Mixed approaches can suffer from these issues as well. Congress has policy options to address these problems. The decision on which approach to use is highly contextual. In addition to the three general approaches of standardization, customization, and mixed approaches in management laws, Congress has policy options to avoid problems such as budget pressures and reduced transparency. The decision on which approach to use is highly contextual and may require regular examination for improved transparency, accountability, efficiency, or effectiveness. Analytical support can come from various sources including agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, and the General Accounting Office (GAO). The overall option is to regularly assess the need for increased customization or standardization in general management laws for better transparency, accountability, efficiency, or effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources such as agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and external evaluators. In cases where customization is prevalent, reducing the analytical burden for Congress and stakeholders can be achieved by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions and updated comparisons across agencies. The executive branch is required to maintain real-time descriptions and updated comparisons across agencies to assist in monitoring the situation and analyzing government-wide developments. This includes areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions and appeals for different agency workforces. Reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization can help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public. The establishment of reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization may help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public in examining the extent of customization and standardization. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, FMS, or others could report how management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis. However, such requirements would likely entail costs for the reporting agencies. The Treasury Department, among others, could report on customized management policies to enable government-wide analysis and comparisons, potentially incurring costs for reporting agencies. General management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement, reflecting how organizations in both private and public sectors operate with a functional orientation. This perspective is valued for its ability to enhance efficiency through specialization and maintain centralized control over strategic decisions. An organization's structure is based on \"customers\" or \"taxpayer groups\" with functional perspectives within business units, shared services, and headquarters. While functional orientation can improve efficiency and centralized control, it can lead to coordination issues and hinder the development of general managers. Functional silos can form, causing problems or missed opportunities for the organization. Management literature emphasizes the importance of functional perspectives within a broader context. Managers can be inhibited by functional silos, leading to missed opportunities. Management literature stresses the importance of integrating functional perspectives within a broader general management context. Different backgrounds and experiences shape individuals' viewpoints on problems, opportunities, or decisions. The importance of integrating functional perspectives within a general management context is highlighted. Different backgrounds and experiences shape individuals' viewpoints, leading to a limited view of the whole story. Developing a general management perspective helps integrate multiple functional perspectives for a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. The importance of developing a general management perspective is emphasized to integrate multiple functional perspectives for a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach can provide a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems, focusing on individual functions while also considering the broader context. The general management laws offer a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems, focusing on individual functional areas. Integration of these laws can provide mutual support through changes to legislation and oversight tools. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting. Congress can use various legislative and oversight tools to improve agency management, such as leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting. This could involve directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists to help agencies better manage their contracts. Congress can support congressional oversight, reauthorization, and appropriations activities by directing specific funding to hire, train, and retain contract oversight specialists to help agencies better manage and monitor their contracts. This can also involve restructuring budget accounts of agencies to align resources with individual programs and conducting program evaluations to align resources with results. Leveraging the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 can ensure agencies dedicate sufficient staff resources for contract management and oversight. Leveraging functional perspectives like program evaluation, human resources management, and acquisition management can help align resources with results in agencies. This can be achieved by developing metrics for assessing staff resources dedicated to contract management and oversight. Options for integrating these perspectives into general management laws could apply broadly or to specific agencies. The history of federal government management reform includes various functional perspectives such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, program evaluation, auditing, investigation, financial management, budgeting, accounting, organization, acquisition management, real property management, intergovernmental relations, human resources management, and ethics. Efforts to improve agencies' performance and management practices have been ongoing, but progress has been challenging. Congress faces difficulties in overseeing executive branch management to ensure improvement. Efforts to improve federal government management practices have faced challenges, with Congress struggling to oversee executive branch agencies. The use of measurement systems to track progress is seen as a motivator for action, but can also create perverse incentives. The use of measurement systems can be a strong motivator for action, but it can also create perverse incentives. For example, rewarding employees based only on short-term profits may lead to neglect of long-term research and development. Similarly, achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through manual workarounds. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported major management problems in executive branch agencies in areas like financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and program implementation. GAO has released reports detailing high-risk areas and management challenges affecting specific agencies since 1992. Since 1992, the GAO has identified high-risk areas and management challenges in executive branch agencies related to financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and program implementation. Despite progress made by the executive branch and Congress, significant work remains to address these issues. Presidential administrations have pursued management reform initiatives, including President Reagan's Reform '88, President Bush's efforts in financial and information resources management, and President Clinton's NPR. Members of Congress have also been involved in addressing these challenges. During this period, management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including President Reagan's Reform '88, President Bush's efforts in financial and information resources management, and President Clinton's NPR. Concerns about government management were frequently expressed by members of Congress and their committee staff. In 1992, the House Committee on Government Operations recommended actions to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources management. Senator Fred Thompson released a report in June 2001 highlighting \"urgent federal government management problems.\" In June 2001, Senator Fred Thompson highlighted urgent federal government management problems, including issues with the federal workforce, financial management, and information technology. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda in August 2001, focusing on five government-wide initiatives. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) released by President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget includes five government-wide initiatives: Strategic Management of Human Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Improved Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government, and Budget and Performance Integration. OMB evaluates agencies quarterly based on \"stoplight scores\" to measure progress on these initiatives. Green indicates meeting all standards, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. Progress is assessed on a case-by-case basis. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) evaluates agencies based on \"stoplight scores\" for five government-wide initiatives. Green indicates meeting all standards, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. Progress is assessed on a case-by-case basis against established deliverables and timelines. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) evaluates agencies with \"stoplight scores\" for five government-wide initiatives. Green indicates meeting all standards, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. The initiatives are mutually reinforcing and use general management laws to achieve goals. For example, the Competitive Sourcing initiative leverages the FAIR Act of 1998, and the Improved Financial Performance initiative leverages the Antideficiency Act and Chief Financial Integrity Act. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) evaluates agencies with \"stoplight scores\" for five government-wide initiatives. These initiatives leverage various general management laws to achieve goals, such as the Competitive Sourcing initiative using the FAIR Act of 1998, and the Improved Financial Performance initiative leveraging multiple acts including the Antideficiency Act. Agencies are making significant progress in implementing the PMA. The PMA evaluates agencies using \"stoplight scores\" for government-wide initiatives that leverage general management laws. While some agencies have made significant progress, there are concerns about transparency in PMA evaluation practices, particularly in comparison to OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool. The PMA evaluates agencies using \"stoplight scores\" for government-wide initiatives, but there are concerns about transparency in evaluation practices. OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool were more transparent, with detailed rationales and worksheets provided. The stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity in evaluations. The PMA evaluates agencies using \"stoplight scores\" for government-wide initiatives, which may introduce subjectivity. Concerns include lack of verification by independent evaluation organizations and the scope not covering all aspects of general management laws. For example, the PMA's acquisition-related initiative, Competitive Sourcing, does not address contract oversight or small business contracting concerns. The PMA's scope does not cover all aspects of general management laws, such as contract oversight and small business contracting concerns. Real property management issues are also not explicitly addressed. Various entities have attempted to influence agencies to improve management practices over the years. Congress has tried to improve agency management practices by measuring compliance with general management laws. Agency IGs, GAO, OMB, and Congress have focused on specific problems and created \"high risk\" programs. Representatives Horn and Putnam issued letter grades for agency financial management and information security. Senator Thompson also graded agency annual performance reports. Stephen Horn, Adam Putnam, and Fred Thompson have issued letter grades to evaluate agency financial management, information security compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and agency annual performance reports required by the Government Performance and Results Act. Congress is exploring options to ensure executive branch agencies improve their management practices and measure agency progress through cross-agency comparisons. Congress is considering options to monitor agency progress in improving management practices, including using existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs. Critics argue that Congress does not use these tools effectively or frequently enough. To improve agency management practices, Congress could ask GAO and agency IGs to verify PMA stoplight scores. This could increase confidence in executive branch measurements, but may be seen as micromanagement. Congress could increase transparency by securing access to final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies, allowing for public discussion on executive branch management. Alternatively, Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures for agency progress in management practices, facilitating systematic comparison across agencies. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures for agency progress in improving management practices, potentially increasing workload and costs but ensuring systematic measurement across agencies. Alternatively, Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and performance reports. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures for agency progress in improving management practices, potentially increasing workload and costs but ensuring systematic measurement across agencies. Alternatively, Congress could require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and performance reports, including establishing milestones and timelines for improvement. This could be included in the government-wide performance plan, potentially increasing workload for agency and OMB personnel. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions is also a major theme in general management laws. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions is a major theme in general management laws, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. This option could make management improvement measurement statutory or more systematic, potentially increasing workload for agency and OMB personnel. The agency \"chief officer\" positions include inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions were established by statute at different times and have specific functions and reporting structures. The agency \"chief officer\" positions include inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions were established by statute at different times and have specific functions and reporting structures. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by an agency head. Reporting relationships vary, with some officers required to report directly to the agency head. The agency \"chief officer\" positions (IGs, CFOs, CIOs, CHCOs, and CAOs) have specific functions and reporting structures. Three officers must report directly to the agency head, while reporting relationships for the other two are at the agency head's discretion. The creation of these positions aimed to address long-standing problems by elevating functional perspectives within agencies. Each group of chief officers was placed into an interagency council by statute or executive order. Many observers believed that functional perspectives within agencies needed to be \"elevated\" to address long-standing problems. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order, with varying memberships. Four councils were established by law, while two (the IG councils) exist through executive order. President Ronald Reagan established the first of these councils, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), with agency IGs as members through executive order in 1981. The PCIE was tasked with coordinating government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management serves as the chair or vice chair for each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to influence their activities. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was established in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan to coordinate government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The PCIE became a source of leverage for agency IGs, enhancing their lobbying power and promoting organizational learning through informal networks and standing committees. The PCIE established standing committees for IGs to share ideas and cooperate on projects, promoting organizational learning. IGs praised the PCIE for providing a unique mechanism to work together on fraud, waste, and abuse issues. However, the PCIE was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs in the late 1980s. The PCIE was praised for its mechanism to work together on fraud, waste, and abuse issues. In the late 1980s, it was criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. President George H. W. Bush established the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs appointed by agency heads in 1992. The CFO Council was created by the CFO Act of 1990, giving the DDM chairperson status over the council. The CFO Council was established by the CFO Act of 1990, giving the DDM chairperson status over the council and responsibility for establishing general management policies in the executive branch. In 1994, council members recommended actions to energize the council. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, initially passive, recommended actions in 1994 to energize the council. Recommendations included broadening membership, electing officers, and setting their own agenda. OMB supported the recommendations, and the council formed committees for special emphasis. The approach of leveraging interagency councils was deemed successful, with the CFO Council serving as a model for other interagency efforts. The CFO Council, established in 1990, recommended actions in 1994 to energize the council by broadening membership, electing officers, and setting their own agenda. OMB's deputy director for management has leveraging opportunities through interagency councils. The CFO Council served as a model for other interagency efforts, leading to the establishment of the CIO Council, CHCO Council, and CAO Council. These chief officer positions have been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives, despite facing some challenges. Observers generally agree that the chief officer positions, established after the CFO Council, have been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives. However, challenges such as high turnover among CIOs, difficulties with change management, and performance measurement persist. Some argue that agencies still struggle with management issues due to budget pressures and lack of attention from short-serving political appointees. Public management scholars have highlighted the challenges agencies face with management issues due to budget pressures and lack of attention from short-serving political appointees. Observers generally agree that interagency councils of chief officers have been beneficial, despite periods of varying effectiveness. Management scholars caution against functional silos that hinder a more integrated general management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have been noted as beneficial for improving federal management by promoting knowledge sharing and best practices among different parts of the government. This collaboration is seen as essential for enhancing organizational performance. Setting up networks of people to share knowledge, best practices, and information is crucial for organizational performance. Interagency councils of chief officers facilitate this collaboration, promoting knowledge sharing and best practices among different parts of the government. From a \"knowledge management\" perspective, management theorists caution against solely focusing on one function in agencies, as it may narrow perspectives and harm overall agency functions. Some suggest reevaluating the structure and role of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Questions arise about the need for additional chief officers in executive branch agencies, the balance of chief officer positions, and preserving institutional memory for political appointees with short tenures. Consider questions regarding chief officers and interagency councils. Should executive branch agencies have more chief officers? How to preserve institutional memory for political appointees with short tenures? Should councils be statutory and funded? How to make councils more accountable to Congress? One option is to establish agency \"chief security officers\" to ensure government services are available in emergencies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that agencies may lack adequate plans for ensuring government services are available in emergencies. Should Congress establish agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) in response to security risks? Many CSOs focus on information technology and report to the CIO, but some handle all security responsibilities. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles between CIOs and CSOs, but it may also bring more integrated security measures. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles between CIOs and CSOs, but it may also bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Some observers argue that requiring an additional type of chief officer for agencies would be excessive. Many federal agencies may already have systems in place to address security issues, and there are concerns about the increasing number of chief officers. Observers note that agencies often do not adequately evaluate program performance or integrate evaluation efforts across agency boundaries due to lack of capacity. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could address the lack of program evaluation efforts and integration across agency boundaries. Proponents argue that these positions could improve performance by creating a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could address the lack of program evaluation efforts and integration across agency boundaries. Evaluation methods vary between programs, and proponents believe that creating these positions could improve performance by giving program evaluation a voice in agency senior management teams. Critics, however, argue that adding more chief officer positions may be excessive. Congress has various options for appointing chief officers, with some positions required to be political, others career-based, and some left to agency discretion. Establishing new chief officer positions in agencies could improve program evaluation efforts and integration. Congress has options for appointing chief officers, with some positions required to be political, others career-based, and some left to agency discretion. There is debate over the benefits of political appointees versus career officials in these roles. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected both perspectives on chief officer reporting relationships. CFOs are political, while deputies are career officials. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the official \"next in rank.\" Reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs are at the agency head's discretion. The appropriateness of these relationships is questioned in light of agency management needs and progress in addressing major management problems. The reporting relationships of CHCOs and CAOs are at the agency head's discretion. One argument for a direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to ensure personal access to senior leadership. However, adding another direct report could overwhelm agency heads. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory. The possibility of making IG councils statutory by codifying the mandates of the PCIE and ECIE into law is being considered. This change could improve training, strengthen the relationship between IGs and Congress, and enhance coordination between IG offices in the federal government. However, some may argue that this could reduce flexibility or control by the President. Financial Management, the vice chair of the PCIE, believes codification would require \"modest appropriations\" but would improve training, strengthen the IGs' relationship with Congress, and enhance coordination between IG offices. Some argue this change could reduce flexibility or control by the President. Funding for interagency councils like the PCIE and ECIE is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. The IG councils (PCIE and ECIE) self-finance their activities through MOUs, while the CHCO Council is funded by the Office of Personnel Management. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council are funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. Congress could maintain the current funding method or consider separate appropriations for each council, potentially giving them more control and improving continuity between presidential administrations. Congress could consider making a separate appropriation for each interagency council, potentially reducing the President's discretion but giving Congress more control. Altering reporting and strategic planning requirements for the councils could improve institutional memory and continuity between administrations. Some councils currently have no reporting or planning requirements, while others only report to the President or Congress without articulating strategic plans. The executive order governing the IG councils requires reporting to the President only. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could mandate submitting plans or reports to increase transparency and accountability. Planning and reporting requirements may limit the President's discretion. The executive order mandates reporting to the President only for IG councils. There are no statutory requirements for CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could enforce planning and reporting requirements to enhance transparency and accountability, potentially limiting the President's discretion. OMB and the President's use of interagency councils could benefit from planning and reporting requirements to increase transparency and accountability to Congress, although this may reduce the President's discretion and raise costs for the councils or OMB."
