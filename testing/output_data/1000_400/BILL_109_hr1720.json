    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the US each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful bacteria and viruses. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various illnesses, resulting in significant economic losses due to beach closures. Between 1.8 to 3.5 million Americans get sick annually from swimming in waters contaminated by sewer overflows, leading to economic losses estimated at $28 billion. Improved monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent many illnesses, as public health authorities are often not notified of these threats. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system. This definition excludes combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act now mandates that publicly owned treatment works must promptly notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows that could affect human health, including notifying public health authorities and other relevant entities within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must promptly notify the Administrator or State of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health, providing an oral or electronic report within 24 hours and a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and mitigate impact. Additionally, they must include all sanitary sewer overflows in their monthly discharge monitoring report. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses taken, and actions to prevent future overflows. Publicly owned treatment works are required to report sanitary sewer overflows, including the amount of wastewater released, overflow duration, location, responses taken for cleanup, and actions to prevent future overflows. States must report details of overflows to the EPA annually. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows. Additionally, authorization of appropriations is set at $2.2 billion for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012."
