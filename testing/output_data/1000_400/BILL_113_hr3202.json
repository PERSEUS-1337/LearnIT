A corrective action plan with program reforms must be submitted within 60 days to relevant committees for consideration in rule-making. The corrective action plan, in response to the assessment, includes an implementation plan with benchmarks, potential programmatic reforms, revisions to regulations, or legislative proposals. The plan will be reviewed by the Comptroller General within 120 days to assess the implementation of recommendations from the national laboratory or maritime security university-based center and the Comptroller. The Secretary of Homeland Security must review and implement recommendations from national laboratories, the Comptroller General, and inform relevant committees on the responsiveness of the plan.
