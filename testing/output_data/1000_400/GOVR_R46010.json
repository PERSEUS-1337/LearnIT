    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized in large power plants. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 as allowing consumers to offset energy generated on-site with energy provided by the utility. Congress encouraged states to adopt net metering, allowing electric consumers to offset energy generated on-site with energy provided by the utility. State net metering policies, particularly for solar PV, play a significant role in discussions about renewable energy sources in the nation's electricity system. Other federal and state policies, such as tax incentives and renewable portfolio standards, can impact the deployment of distributed solar energy sources and other types of distributed generation. Net metering is the most common energy type used, comprising 97% of capacity in 2018. Federal and state policies interact with net metering to determine the pace of solar energy deployment. Some states have modified their net metering policies, with effects on stakeholders. Congress could choose to restrict, encourage, or require state policy modifications related to net metering. This report provides background information and discusses current issues on net metering policy. This report discusses current issues related to net metering policy, which determines how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they deliver to the grid. Net metering typically involves compensating customers on a one-to-one basis for electricity purchased from the grid based on the electricity they generate. Net metering policy compensates customers for electricity delivered to the grid on a one-to-one basis. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. This report uses the term net metering to refer to any of these options. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies including alternatives to net energy metering. In states without a requirement, some utilities voluntarily offer net metering. Nearly 2 million customers participated in net metering, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Net metering policies in 45 states require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some offering alternatives. Almost 2 million customers participated in net metering in 2018, representing about 1% of U.S. electricity customers. Participation has increased since 2013. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018, with participation varying by state. Hawaii has the highest participation rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation include state policies and other relevant factors. The participation rates in net metering programs vary by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation include state policies, renewable portfolio standards, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. Ratemaking is the process of allocating total costs to customers in producing and delivering electricity, with many complexities and local factors involved. Electricity ratemaking is the process of allocating costs to customers for producing and delivering electricity. State regulators approve rates for utilities to charge customers, ensuring cost recovery through bill payments. This section provides an overview of typical ratemaking considerations for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities. Vertically-integrated utilities own and operate all parts of the electricity system, including generation, transmission, and distribution. State regulators approve rates for cost recovery, which include building and operating power plants, maintaining the grid, utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and a return on investments. The process of setting rates for electricity involves considering various costs such as grid operation, meter data collection, bill relief programs, and return on investments. Volumetric rates are commonly used, where customers within the same class pay a rate per kilowatt-hour, resulting in varying bills based on electricity consumption. Regulators estimate rates to ensure utilities recover total costs for generation, transmission, and distribution. Customers' bills vary monthly based on electricity consumption. Regulators estimate volumetric rates to cover utility costs shared among all customers. Customer charges, separate from electricity rates, appear as fixed values on bills. Bills include volumetric charges and fixed customer charges. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering, but the law did not specify how customers should be compensated. States with net metering have taken different approaches in implementing their policies, and many states have revised their compensation approaches in recent years. States with net metering have different approaches in compensating customers, which can impact DG markets. A common approach is to compensate customers at the utility's retail rate, known as net energy metering (NEM) policy. The section discusses states' approaches to implementing net metering, where customers are compensated at the utility's retail rate. Initially, policymakers viewed the retail rate as a proxy for setting rates, assuming it was sufficient for valuing solar or distributed generation. Retail rates were initially seen as a suitable proxy for valuing solar or distributed generation in the early stages of implementing net metering. This was due to the small number of participating customers and the limited energy each contributed, minimizing the impact of any errors in estimating the true value. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation as they reflect the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation, reflecting the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. This encourages net metering participation as customers can recover upfront costs of a DG system more quickly. However, compensating net metering customers at the retail rate may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. Compensating net metering customers at retail rates may result in increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. This arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers, where net metering customers reduce the amount of utility-provided electricity they need but still rely on other utility services like maintaining the grid. As a result, rates for non-net metering customers could increase to cover the costs not recovered from net metering. Solar net metering customers may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers, potentially resulting in a cost shift or cross-subsidy. This is due to net metering customers reducing their reliance on utility-provided electricity while still benefiting from grid maintenance. There are concerns over potential equity issues as net metering customers tend to have higher incomes. Studies vary in their findings on the extent of cross-subsidies, with differences in methodologies used to estimate costs and benefits. Studies disagree on the extent of cross-subsidies from non-net metering customers to net metering customers. Methodological differences in estimating costs and benefits contribute to the lack of consensus on the magnitude of cross-subsidies. Local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies. Estimates from around 2015 suggest net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer annually. Observers may differ on what level of cross-subsidy warrants policy action. One synthesis of estimates from around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer per year. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, including net metering, and found that DG would likely cause rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not automatically mean non-net metering customers are affected. The study on net metering and distributed generation (DG) found that rate effects would likely increase between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. Cost shifts may occur, but it doesn't necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers. Addressing cost shifts through ratemaking processes could be delayed due to inherent time lags, and cost shifts are not unique to DG. Regulators aim to mitigate these effects in rate design. Some states are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation. States are exploring options to allocate system costs and benefits more precisely to net metering customers. Some states are exploring options to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation for net metering customers. This includes adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates to allow utilities to recover costs for grid maintenance and operation. Proponents argue that this approach reduces cost shifting and increases fairness, with utilities and some advocates for low-income customers supporting the idea. Proponents of compensating net metering customers at the retail rate argue that it offers administrative simplicity and fairness, supported by utilities and some advocates for low-income customers. Opponents, including the solar industry and environmental advocates, believe that net metering promotes competition and societal benefits, and adding fixed charges may discourage distributed generation. Determining accurate fixed charges for net metering customers' grid use has been complex and controversial in practice. Some states have adopted alternative compensation rates to address these issues. Determining fixed charges for net metering customers' grid use has been complex. Some states use an avoided cost rate to compensate for energy costs utilities avoid. This rate primarily reflects energy production costs, unlike the retail rate which includes all utility expenses. Some states also consider network upgrades needed for distributed generation integration. The avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, primarily reflects energy production costs and may include network upgrades for distributed generation integration. It is usually lower than retail rates. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar rate. Cost rates for net metering customers with solar PV are typically lower than retail rates. They may be compensated based on a value of solar (VOS) rate, which reflects societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design. The VOS rate is often higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, with some states potentially setting a VOS rate higher than retail rates based on the perceived benefits of solar. States may consider reduced greenhouse gas emissions a benefit of distributed solar PV. The Value of Solar (VOS) rate, higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, reflects estimated grid and societal benefits of distributed energy resources. New York is one state implementing this approach. Alternative compensation approaches debate which costs and benefits to consider and how to quantify them. The debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed solar PV includes considerations of costs and benefits, as well as challenges related to quantifying time- and location-specific factors. States vary in their evaluation of net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis of 15 state studies conducted for the U.S. Department of Energy. The 2018 analysis for the U.S. Department of Energy reviewed 15 state studies on net metering costs and benefits, highlighting the impact of different assumptions and value categories. State net metering policies vary in compensation, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, all of which can influence the deployment of distributed generation. The analysis for the U.S. Department of Energy in 2018 reviewed state studies on net metering policies, focusing on provisions like program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership. Program caps set limits on participation in distributed generation, affecting deployment. They can reduce risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies, but may also hinder policy goals. Net metering policies may include program caps to mitigate risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies. These caps can impact the achievement of renewable energy goals. States determine which generation sources can participate based on capacity limits and technology type, with solar energy being the dominant source. Factors such as cost, customer type, and location also influence participation of non-solar projects. Net metering allows for participation of various energy types based on factors like cost, customer type, and location. Customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid when their generation exceeds consumption. Net metering customers with large acreage can deliver surplus generation to the grid, receiving credits on their next bill if generation exceeds consumption. State policies vary in compensating for total generation or just surplus, with different provisions for credit retention. This can potentially reduce customers' electricity costs to $0. The customer receives a credit on the next bill based on net metering policies. Credits can carry over depending on state provisions. Different arrangements like aggregate and shared net metering are possible, including virtual net metering for shared projects located onsite. Shared net metering allows multiple customers to benefit from the same net metering generation capacity, such as community solar projects. Virtual net metering is a similar concept for shared projects located onsite, like multi-family dwellings. Third party participation, such as solar leasing, allows entities other than the electricity consumer to own the solar system. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address state net metering policies, with proposals that could impact state regulations on compensation rates and fixed charges for net metering customers. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address state net metering policies, including proposals that could impact state regulations on compensation rates and fixed charges for net metering customers. Legislation in the 114th and 116th Congresses aimed to limit state regulators' ability to change compensation rates, consider cross-subsidies in net metering policies, and require studies on the costs and benefits of net metering. Legislation in the 116th Congress, such as S. 346 and H.R. 1009, would require studies on the costs and benefits of net metering, including alternative incentives for distributed generation and consumer incentives."
