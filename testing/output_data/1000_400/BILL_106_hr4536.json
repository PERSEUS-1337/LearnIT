    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Participation in quality physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight youth has more than doubled in the past 30 years. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be healthier and more physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths per year. Physically fit adults have reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke, highlighting the importance of promoting physical activity in children. Children should have daily physical education to promote health and fitness. Inactivity and poor diet contribute to obesity-related diseases costing the US economy over $100 billion annually. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. However, children are not as active as they should be, with fewer than 1 in 4 getting enough vigorous activity each day. Surgeon General's 1996 Report and CDC recommend daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Recommendation for daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12 has not seen much progress since it was first encouraged by Congress. Quality physical education programs are essential for developing health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity to promote healthy and active lifestyles for all students. Quality physical education programs are crucial for developing health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity to promote healthy and active lifestyles for all students. Every student in schools should have the opportunity to achieve the goals set by Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Local educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary outlining plans to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. Goals include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and overall physical well-being. Physical education programs should include fitness education, motor skills instruction, cognitive concepts about physical fitness, social and cooperative skill development, and instruction in healthy eating habits and nutrition. Physical education programs should include skill and physical fitness for a healthy lifestyle, opportunities for social and cooperative skills development, and instruction in healthy eating habits and nutrition. Teachers should receive professional development to stay updated on research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Funds may include participation of home-schooled and private school students. Reporting is required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving funding for multiyear grants or contracts. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress detailing the success of programs improving physical fitness and making recommendations for program continuation and improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed. The grant or contract funds for a local educational agency under this part must limit administrative costs to 5 percent. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90 percent in the first year and 75 percent in subsequent years. Funds should supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 is set at $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004. The funds allocated will remain available until expended."
