Dynamic analysis is a commonly used approach in Android malware detection, focusing on run-time execution characteristics like system calls, network connections, and memory utilization. While static analysis is preferred for its advantages such as low computational cost and resource utilization, dynamic analysis can detect metamorphic and polymorphic malwares.

The paper discusses the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in cyber security, proposing a unique architecture for various use cases. It explains the concepts of DNN architecture and training techniques, emphasizing the feed forward network as a commonly used algorithm. A feed forward network (FFN) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) where units are connected with edges in a single direction without forming cycles. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a subset of FFN with 3 or more layers - input, hidden, and output layers. The number of hidden layers is parameterized based on data complexity, forming an acyclic graph that passes information forward without relying on past input. The number of hidden layers in a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is parameterized based on data complexity, forming an acyclic graph that passes information forward without relying on past input. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are efficient for accelerating the training process in MLP networks. When the network consists of multiple hidden layers, the combined representation can be defined as Rectified linear units (ReLU), which accelerate the training process efficiently. Using ReLU is more time-efficient for training large amounts of data compared to traditional activation functions like logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent. Neurons with this nonlinearity are referred to as ReLU. TensorFlow and Keras are used as software frameworks, with GPU-enabled TensorFlow for faster gradient descent computations in deep learning architectures. Task 1 involves classifying Android malware using a dataset of unique API information from APK files collected from the Opera Mobile Store. Each API is related to a permission, and success in executing the API depends on user-granted permissions. The dataset includes application package files collected from the Opera Mobile Store in 2014. APIs in the apps require specific permissions to run successfully, categorized as Normal, Dangerous, Signature, or Signature Or System in AndroidManifest.xml files. Task 2 involves analyzing operational log files from Unified Threat Management of UniteCloud BID25, a cloud infrastructure for e-learning and e-research services in New Zealand. Unified Threat Management (UTM) of UniteCloud BID25 provides e-learning and e-research services for tertiary students and staff in New Zealand. The operational log files contain nine features from sensors in the UTM system, labeled based on incident status. Task 3 involves fraud detection using anonymized data unified with the HCRUD approach. Experimentation is done to find an optimal learning rate. The data sets for Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3 were anonymized and unified using the HCRUD approach. Experimentation was conducted to determine the optimal learning rate, with the highest accuracy achieved at a learning rate of 0.1. Accuracy decreased at 0.2 but improved at 0.35, 0.45, and 0.45. Running experiments for 1000 epochs may further enhance accuracy. The experiments involved testing different learning rates (0.35, 0.45, 0.45) compared to 0.1, with accuracy potentially improved by running for 1000 epochs. Complex architectures showed lower performance within 500 epochs, leading to the decision to use a learning rate of 0.1 for subsequent experiments. Various network topologies were tested (1-5 layers) with 2 trials each, running until 500 epochs. Most architectures learned normal category patterns within 600 epochs, while learning malicious data varied, requiring more iterations for complex networks.
