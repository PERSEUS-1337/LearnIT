    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including lax screening, lack of in-flight security measures, and a failure of imagination among senior officials. The 9/11 Commission identified weaknesses in aviation security, including a lack of protocols for responding to hijackings and a failure of imagination among senior officials. Agencies had not taken specific actions to defend against potential threats before September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission found that before September 11, 2001, aviation security experts underestimated the likelihood of a suicide hijacking scenario. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service rather than specific actions to defend against potential threats. Congress concentrated on improving air service with a 'passenger bill of rights' instead of addressing security concerns. After September 11, 2001, Congress swiftly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address aviation security weaknesses. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all transportation modes. Key highlights included creating a federal security screener workforce. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to address vulnerabilities in transportation systems after 9/11. Key measures included federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and cockpit door hardening. ATSA also granted TSA broad authority to assess and implement security measures across all transportation modes. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it, authorizing measures like arming airline pilots and implementing aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems. The Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act established an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and expanded the program to arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Despite improvements, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission also identified these vulnerabilities. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles. Recommendations were made for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. The Commission acknowledged concerns but did not issue recommendations for inadequate access controls in secured areas of airports and general aviation operations. The 9/11 Commission made recommendations for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. It did not issue specific recommendations for inadequate access controls in secured areas of airports and general aviation operations, or for shoulder-fired missile attacks against commercial airliners. The Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system implemented by the TSA to address various terrorist tactics. The 9/11 Commission recommended a multi-layered security system for aviation, focusing on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation. This system should consist of effective and coordinated security layers to create redundancies. The recommendations address gaps in airport passenger and baggage screening, air cargo security, and the need for TSA to implement concentric rings of security. The 9/11 Commission focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation and made six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, intensifying efforts on cargo security, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made for transportation security policy to prioritize based on risks. The 9/11 Commission made six aviation-specific recommendations to enhance security, including improving passenger pre-screening, deploying baggage screening systems, and intensifying cargo security efforts. They also recommended setting transportation security priorities based on risk and implementing cost-effective deterrents. On September 11, 2001, passenger pre-screening measures included CAPPS, security questions, and photo identification, with over half of the hijackers being identified through these techniques. The pre-screening measures on September 11, 2001 included CAPPS, security questions, and photo identification. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these techniques, but there were little consequences to their selection at that time. CAPPS has since been expanded to screen for possible hijackers using computer algorithms. The CAPPS system, originally used in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103, has been expanded to screen for possible hijackers. Its follow-on, CAPPS II, has faced controversy over privacy concerns. It would authenticate passengers' identities and check them against terrorist watch lists, allowing for denial of boarding or secondary screening if flagged. The 9/11 Commission recommended improved pre-screening capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing a two-step process for passenger pre-screening, utilizing commercial databases to authenticate identities and checking names against federal terrorist watch lists. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns with CAPPS II, limiting its implementation to system testing until verified by the Government Accountability Office. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns with CAPPS II, limiting its implementation to system testing until verified by the Government Accountability Office. The TSA had only addressed one of eight concerns regarding CAPPS II implementation, with airlines reluctant to provide data for testing due to liability concerns. Recent reports suggest that the CAPPS II program has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may be considered. The 9/11 Commission recommended airlines provide information for passenger pre-screening, but progress has been stalled. CAPPS II program has been scrapped due to privacy concerns, with a potential new program in the works. Congress may increase oversight of the Secure Flight program and debate the best way forward. H.R. 10 proposes TSA take over pre-screening within 180 days and begin testing by November 1, 2004. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, with evidence from the Philippines Airlines bombing as a precursor to larger attacks. H.R. 10 proposes TSA take over pre-screening from airlines within 180 days and begin testing the Secure Flight program by November 1, 2004. The report describes Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight as a precursor to the \"Bojinka\" plot to bomb multiple U.S.-bound airliners. Yousef assembled an IED on the plane and hid it under a seat with a digital watch timer. Concerns over IEDs were raised after incidents involving Richard Reid and Nathaniel Heatwole. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers and recommended improving screening technologies and procedures. New technology offers better capabilities for detecting explosives carried by passengers. New technology is being tested at various airport sites to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals, including body scan imaging using low dose x-ray backscatter or other techniques. This technology aims to improve the limited capabilities of current screening methods in detecting explosives carried by passengers. The TSA is testing new technology at airports to detect explosives on passengers, including body scan imaging and bomb-sniffing dogs. Congress may debate funding for implementing these measures based on the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. The TSA is addressing screener performance issues highlighted by the 9/11 Commission and a recent DHS audit through initiatives like threat image projection testing. The TSA is addressing poor screener performance through initiatives like threat image projection testing and improving recurrent training for screeners. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. However, research on aviation security human factors and funding for these activities are limited. The TSA is addressing poor screener performance through initiatives like threat image projection testing and improving recurrent training for screeners. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. However, research on aviation security human factors and funding for these activities are limited, with a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. The TSA is addressing poor screener performance through initiatives like threat image projection testing and improving recurrent training. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. H.R. 10 contains a provision that would require the TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance as part of a pilot program to examine next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. The TSA has not conducted a focused study on human factors needs in aviation security since 9/11. H.R. 10 includes a provision for human factors studies to improve screener performance and examine new screening technologies. Congress may debate funding for installing baggage screening systems recommended by the 9/11 Commission. Only $250 million was allocated for this activity in FY2004 and FY2005, despite a total estimated cost of over $4 billion for integrating EDS equipment at all airports. The TSA allocated only $250 million in FY2004 and FY2005 for integrating EDS equipment at airports, despite a total estimated cost of over $4 billion. The 9/11 Commission recommended leveraging limited federal funding through Letters of Intent (LOIs) to airports, but the TSA has been reimbursing expenses as they are incurred, potentially slowing down the integration progress. The TSA allocated $250 million in FY2004 and FY2005 for EDS integration at airports, but the total cost is over $4 billion. The 9/11 Commission recommended using LOIs to convey future funding intent, but the TSA is reimbursing expenses as they occur, potentially delaying progress. Airlines and airports share costs, with airlines paying the first $250 million annually from security fees. Defining a fair share of costs has been a point of contention. The TSA proposed increasing the local share of costs for EDS integration at airports, which airports oppose. The 9/11 Commission suggested industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme, leading to ongoing debate in Congress over cost-sharing equity. The 9/11 Commission recommended a more equitable contribution from the industry for airport security. Congress is debating the equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration. Proposed legislation aims to increase aviation security fees and TSA flexibility. Legislation (H.R. 5121) aims to double aviation security fees for security capital fund and increase TSA flexibility for baggage screening. Recommendations include intensifying efforts to identify and screen suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, based on recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. The plan includes a risk-based approach with four key objectives: enhancing shipper and supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. The goals of the plan involve pre-screening all cargo shipments to determine their risk level. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security, unveiled in November 2003, focuses on four key objectives: enhancing shipper and supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. The plan aims to pre-screen all cargo shipments, inspect items posing elevated risks, deploy new technology solutions, and implement operational and regulatory programs to enhance security measures. The 9/11 Commission supports TSA's approach but calls for accelerated progress towards achieving these objectives. The 9/11 Commission supports TSA's strategic plan for cargo security but calls for faster progress. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches. Recent debate has focused on the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. Congress has supported TSA's plan to implement security measures instead of requiring 100% physical screening. Recent debate in Congress over air cargo security has focused on the level of physical screening or inspection of cargo needed to mitigate risks on passenger aircraft. Congress supports TSA's risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. Both H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to enhance cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 requiring TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission recommends deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious items. S. 2845 would require TSA to double air cargo screening within one year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious items, which could increase operational costs for passenger airlines. The annual industry-wide cost of lost revenue due to reduced aircraft revenue payload and increased fuel burn would total $11 million. Opponents argue that hardened cargo containers may not be necessary if other cargo security measures are implemented. Proponents believe deploying hardened cargo containers adds an extra layer of defense. However, using just one hardened cargo container per passenger aircraft still leaves potential vulnerabilities. The TSA requires all cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. TSA is working on detecting high-risk cargo but it's unclear how this system can allow suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. The TSA requires all cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. There are concerns about allowing suspicious cargo to travel on passenger aircraft even if secured in hardened cargo containers. Congress may debate the effectiveness of hardened cargo containers in protecting against potential cargo bombings. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct a pilot program. The debate over using hardened cargo containers for security against cargo bombings includes key policy issues such as allowing suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft. H.R. 10 and S. 2845 propose different approaches, with H.R. 10 requiring a pilot program for blast-resistant containers and S. 2845 focusing on evaluating technology. The 9/11 Commission also recommends establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets, including blast-resistant cargo container technology for aviation security. A unified strategic plan is needed to allocate limited resources effectively and assign roles to federal, state, local authorities, and private stakeholders. The 9/11 Commission recommended a unified strategic plan for aviation security to allocate resources effectively and assign roles to various authorities and stakeholders. The TSA has focused on meeting ATSA mandates post-9/11 attacks, but now needs to develop a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely based on a risk-based multi-layered approach. The TSA has achieved normal operations and should focus on developing a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely based on a risk-based multi-layered approach. Congress may consider tasking the TSA with addressing funding needs, budgetary implications, and the roles of federal, local, state authorities, and industry stakeholders in aviation security. The TSA may need to develop a formal national strategy for aviation security, addressing funding, budget, roles of authorities, and industry stakeholders. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement in aviation security. Local jurisdictions handle airport site security, while TSA maintains security oversight. The local role in aviation security involves defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement. Local jurisdictions handle airport site security, while TSA maintains security oversight and enforcement. Local governments and state authorities provide law enforcement support for airport site security and presence at screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers participate in security through procedures and training for controlling access to aircraft and secured areas of airports. Security measures in air cargo and general aviation rely heavily on direct participation. The current lack of a unified plan or strategy for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders in aviation security is a key issue. Implementing security involves federal, state, local, and industry participation, but a cohesive strategy is missing. This includes defining how each element contributes to the overall security strategy and considering logistics and costs. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission suggest improvements in the strategic approach to aviation security. The lack of a unified plan for assigning roles and missions in aviation security is a key issue. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission suggest improvements in strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. Congress and the TSA should consider integrating specific aviation security strategies with an overarching transportation security strategy that includes rail, maritime, and highway security. H.R. 10 requires the Department of Homeland Security to prepare transportation security plans. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop transportation security plans, including modal plans for aviation, to prioritize risks, choose cost-effective protection methods, and assign roles to authorities and stakeholders. Congress has focused on implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report, with hearings held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Subcommittee on Aviation. Since the release of the 9/11 Commission report, Congress has given considerable attention to its recommendations on transportation security. The 108th Congress passed legislation related to aviation security, including the Vision 100 -- Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the Commission's recommendations. Several aviation security provisions were already in place before the 9/11 Commission completed its report. Vision 100 -- Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L.108-176) included aviation security provisions before the 9/11 Commission's report. It established a redress process for aviation professionals and required justification for Air Defense Identification Zones. Vision 100, part of the Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, introduced measures for aviation security. It mandated justification for Air Defense Identification Zones, modified security training for airline crews, and required a study on the effectiveness of the aviation security system. Vision 100 mandated basic security training for airline crews and a voluntary advanced self-defense program by TSA. It required a study on aviation security effectiveness, recommendations for improvement, and created the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. Vision 100 established the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. It authorized grants for airports to enhance baggage explosive detection systems and other security-related capital improvement projects, with federal cost-sharing guidelines set at 90% for large and medium hub airports and 95% for all other airports. Vision 100 established the Aviation Security Capital Fund with grants for airports to improve security systems. It also required security programs for air charter operators and a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office reviewed the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system, leading to the development of the \"Secure Flight\" program. Vision 100 also authorized armed pilots through the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program and expanded it to include other flight crew members. Regulations were required to ensure security for both foreign and domestic flights. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members and required regulations for the security of foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. It also transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to the DHS. The Vision 100 Act transferred background check duties for foreign pilots seeking flight training in the United States from the Department of Justice to the DHS. It requires notification and identification information for individuals training in smaller aircraft and mandates background checks before training in larger aircraft. The legislation also allows fee collections to cover the costs of these checks. The National Intelligence Reform Act contains provisions addressing aviation security concerns and recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) includes provisions for aviation security, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including one for aviation. This plan must outline threats to the aviation system, security measures in place, and a plan for reconstitution after a terrorist attack. The act also mandates the TSA to issue guidance on using biometrics in airport access control systems. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to develop a threat matrix for civil aviation security, implement biometric technologies for access control, and allocate funds for research and development. Testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system was also required by a specific deadline. The act authorizes funds for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security, including establishing a center of excellence. TSA required to begin testing an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005, and assume passenger prescreening role within 180 days after completion. Redress procedures for falsely identified passengers, oversight board, and safeguards for system security and integrity are also mandated. The act mandates the TSA to establish redress procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted, minimize false positives, ensure system security, conduct prescreening for international flights, screen individuals against terrorist watch lists, and allow air charter companies to voluntarily submit information. The act requires individuals seeking FAA certificates and unescorted access to airport secure areas to be screened against the terrorist watch list. It also mandates the TSA to establish a process for prescreening customers using aircraft over 12,500 pounds. Additionally, it directs reports on the impact of selectee and no fly lists on privacy, criteria for placing names on the watch list, and prioritizing DHS development efforts. The act requires the DHS to prioritize developing airport screening technologies to detect weapons and explosives. It also mandates the TSA to initiate a pilot program for advanced screening systems at airports and allocate $150 million per year for this purpose in FY2005 and FY2006. The DHS is tasked with creating a strategic plan for explosive detection equipment at airport screening checkpoints. The TSA must conduct a pilot program for advanced screening systems at multiple airports by March 31, 2005, with $150 million allocated annually in FY2005 and FY2006. Additionally, the act requires a human factors study to improve screener performance, protection of Federal air marshals' anonymity, and training for law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism and identification of fraudulent documents. The act mandates the Federal Air Marshal Service to protect the anonymity of air marshals and train law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism and identifying fraudulent documents. It also encourages international agreements for deploying air marshals on international flights and authorizes air marshal training for foreign law enforcement. Additionally, the TSA is authorized to expedite the installation of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports and study cost-sharing options for this activity. The act authorizes the TSA to expedite the installation of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports and study cost-sharing options. It increases the authorization for the aviation security capital fund and directs the TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew members. The act also requires the FAA to issue tamper-resistant pilot licenses. The Vision 100 act directs TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew to discreetly notify pilots of security breaches. It also requires FAA to issue tamper-resistant pilot licenses with unique identifiers. TSA must develop staffing standards for airport security and DHS to study integrating screening workforce for efficiency. The DHS is directed to study integrating screening workforce and other aviation security functions for efficiency. The act authorizes $100 million for improved explosive detection systems and prohibits carrying butane lighters on airplanes. The President is urged to pursue international treaties to limit MANPADS proliferation worldwide. The act requires TSA to prohibit butane lighters and other inappropriate carry-on items. It also directs the President to pursue international treaties to limit MANPADS proliferation and arrange for their destruction worldwide. FAA must establish a process for certifying missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, and DHS is tasked with providing expedited certification for airworthiness and safety. The act mandates diplomatic efforts to address MANPADS non-proliferation, annual briefings to Congress on these efforts, expedited certification for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, a report on aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers, and funding for improved air cargo and airport security. The act authorizes funding for improved air cargo and airport security, including technologies for better cargo identification and screening. It establishes a grant program for advanced air cargo security technology and requires the TSA to issue final regulations for cargo operations security. Additionally, the act mandates a report on threats from international cargo shipments and the potential for secure facilities. The DHS is required to issue final regulations for the security of cargo operations for both passenger and all-cargo aircraft. The act also mandates a report on threats posed by international cargo shipments and the potential for establishing secure facilities along aviation routes. Additionally, the DHS is directed to research, develop, and procure systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft. The Department of Homeland Security is directed to research, develop, and procure certified systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft, with a focus on increasing the percentage of cargo inspected. Policy concerns regarding general aviation security and air cargo security procedures were not fully addressed during the 108th Congress, despite some provisions reflecting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. During the 108th Congress, policy concerns over general aviation security and air cargo security procedures were not adequately addressed through legislation. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned concerns about general aviation operations but did not make formal recommendations. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with a provision in Vision 100 requiring the development of a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Temporary flight restrictions over stadiums were also addressed in appropriations language. During the 108th Congress, legislation on general aviation security was seen as lacking compared to other aviation security concerns. Concerns were raised about the risk posed by general aviation corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters following a joint assessment by the FBI and DHS. Legislation on general aviation security during the 108th Congress was criticized for not being as comprehensive as other aviation security measures. Concerns were raised about the risk posed by private planes and helicopters following a joint assessment by the FBI and DHS. Additionally, air cargo security operations and oversight were not adequately addressed, with Senate measures being stripped from the final National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The Senate's comprehensive measures on air cargo security were removed from the final National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules to ensure desired objectives are met."
