SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts before entering into them. Results must be submitted to the Secretary for review, provided to registered individuals or entities, and made available for public inspection, including online publication.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMENTS. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nWithin 15 days of a government agency publishing the results of a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract, employees and interested parties can submit written comments challenging the accuracy of the results. Additionally, agency employees can submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature and cannot be performed by government employees to avoid underutilization."
