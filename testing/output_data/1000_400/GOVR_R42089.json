    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency, including tax incentives. The federal government is still deciding on the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the US was by the residential sector, which has gradually increased over time. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was by the residential sector. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years on a per capita and aggregate basis. Per capita energy use in the residential sector has been relatively constant since the 1970s, but started trending downward in the mid- to late-2000s, indicating efficiency gains. Per capita residential energy use has been relatively constant since the 1970s, but started trending downward in the mid- to late-2000s, suggesting efficiency gains. Despite potential for increased energy efficiency, concerns exist about consumers investing in optimal levels. Increasing energy efficiency could lead to reduced residential energy use per capita over time, although population growth may still drive total residential energy consumption up. Increasing energy efficiency could change residential energy use trends, potentially reducing energy use per capita over time. This report explores the use of tax credits to promote residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers to optimal investment in energy-efficient technologies. The report discusses the economic rationale for residential energy-efficiency tax incentives to address market failures and barriers. It outlines various tax incentives available for residential energy efficiency in the 2017 tax year. Taxpayers in the 2017 tax year can claim tax credits for residential energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy technologies. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit allows for credits on building envelope improvements and high-efficiency appliances for primary residences. The credit is 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of energy-efficient property, capped at a specific amount. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit in 2017 allows taxpayers to claim a credit for residential energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy technologies for their primary residence. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on building envelope improvements and energy-efficient property, capped at a specific amount. Taxpayers generally claim the maximum credit value of $500 for high-efficiency appliances. The Section 25C credit expired at the end of 2017. The Section 25C tax credit expired in 2017, and taxpayers cannot claim it if they claimed $500 or more before that year. The Section 25D credit allows for a 30% tax credit on renewable energy technologies installed in residences, with rates decreasing in the following years and expiring after 2021. The Section 25D tax credit offers a 30% credit for renewable energy technologies, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, expiring after that year. The credit is calculated based on expenditures for renewable energy technologies, with no maximum value. Rational consumers would invest in energy-efficient technologies if the savings outweigh the costs. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technologies if the savings from using the property exceeded the cost. However, some consumers do not make these investments, known as the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories and market failures may explain why consumers do not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency. Various economic theories and market failures may explain why consumers do not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency. Market barriers and failures, such as externalities and principal-agent problems, contribute to the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" The Section 25C and Section 25D credits may not address these issues effectively, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Energy efficiency credits like 25C and 25D may not fully address market failures and barriers that hinder optimal residential energy investments. Externalities, principal-agent problems, capital market imperfections, and informational issues contribute to suboptimal energy efficiency investments. Energy consumption externalities, such as pollution costs, may lead to underallocation of resources for residential energy efficiency. Externalities, like pollution costs, can cause markets to underallocate resources for residential energy-efficiency investment. Consumers may not pay the full cost of electricity consumption if prices do not reflect environmental consequences, leading to suboptimal energy efficiency investments. Positive externalities can occur with the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, as knowledge spillover effects can encourage others to follow suit. The adoption of energy-efficient technologies can lead to positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Market failures, such as underinvestment in energy efficiency and the principal-agent problem, can hinder optimal resource allocation in residential energy efficiency investments. Market failures, like knowledge spillover effects and the principal-agent problem, can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Landlords and builders may not prioritize energy-efficient technologies due to disconnects between decision-makers and end-users. New homes may opt for lower-cost, less efficient technologies if they doubt the return on investment for high-efficiency products. Landlords and builders may not invest optimally in energy efficiency without knowledge of end user energy use patterns. Capital market imperfections and high initial costs can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient property, especially for low-income households lacking upfront funds. Consumers lacking information may settle for less energy-efficient options. Consumers may settle for less energy-efficient options due to high initial costs and lack of information. Low-income households, unable to obtain funds upfront, may opt for cheaper alternatives. Lack of knowledge about energy-saving technologies can also hinder investment. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help address market failures or barriers. Various government policies, including tax incentives, grants, rebates, and credit enhancements, can enhance market functioning in the face of barriers. Governments can also address energy market failures through regulations, mandates, and informational programs like Energy Star labeling. The government can address energy market failures through regulations, mandates, and informational programs like Energy Star labeling. Tax incentives like Section 25C and Section 25D credits can lower the cost of energy-efficiency investments, encouraging additional investment in these technologies. Other tax incentives, such as the now-expired energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit, reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Tax incentives like the now-expired energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit (IRC \u00a745M) reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products and encourage additional investment in energy-efficient technologies. These incentives may also increase awareness about energy-efficiency technologies. However, tax credits may not be the most economically efficient policy option if markets underinvest in energy efficiency due to artificially low electricity prices. Tax credits may not be the most economically efficient policy option for increasing energy-efficiency investment if markets underinvest in energy efficiency due to artificially low electricity prices. Allowing electricity prices to fully reflect electricity costs by removing federal financial support or taxing electricity production with external costs not reflected in market prices would encourage increased investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Increasing the price of electricity to reflect full costs would promote investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Existing tax incentives do not address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters or landlords for residential energy efficiency investments. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency do not benefit renters or landlords, as they cannot claim incentives for investments in rental properties. Other tax incentives, like the credit for energy-efficient new homes, address market problems more directly. However, tax credits may not be the most effective policy for immediate savings due to delays in claiming them. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not be effective for homeowners facing credit constraints. While they reduce investment costs, they may not provide immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidizing efficiency through tax credits could benefit consumers lacking information on energy-efficient technologies, increasing their adoption and societal welfare. However, for well-informed consumers, tax credits may not be necessary to encourage energy-efficient choices. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may be beneficial for increasing adoption of technologies, but recent research suggests they may decrease total welfare for well-informed consumers. Targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies may maximize benefits. However, these tax credits may not address all market failures, limiting their effectiveness in promoting energy-efficient technologies. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits aim to boost investment in residential energy-efficient property, but may not fully address market failures. Their effectiveness in increasing energy-efficient technology usage is uncertain, as they may only reward consumers who would have made investments anyway. Residential energy-efficiency tax credits aim to encourage investments but may only reward consumers who would have invested anyway. These tax benefits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and face administrative issues according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency aim to encourage additional investments but may only reward consumers who would have invested anyway, potentially leading to windfall gains without increasing overall energy efficiency. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investments or reduced energy consumption, raising concerns about their effectiveness since the 1970s. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed doubts about the impact of tax credits on the marketplace during House hearings in 1979. During House hearings in 1979, Representative Bill Frenzel expressed doubts about the effectiveness of tax credits for residential energy efficiency. He noted that the tax credits did not seem to provide a significant incentive in the marketplace and were not an efficient stimulus. Research on the impact of these tax credits on energy-efficiency property investments in the late 1970s and early 1980s has yielded mixed results. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in stimulating additional investment in energy-efficiency property is uncertain. Some researchers suggest that tax incentives may lead to increased investment, while others argue that the credits mainly result in windfall gains for recipients. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments may not significantly impact consumer purchasing decisions due to other market incentives, delayed savings realization, and the reduction in investment price. Policymakers need to evaluate if tax credits truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments may not have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions due to delayed savings realization and limited financial incentives for certain taxpayers. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments mainly benefit higher-income taxpayers, motivating them to make energy-efficient choices. These incentives may also encourage consumers to invest in high-efficiency equipment when replacing old units. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments target homeowners to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties. These incentives aim to motivate higher-income taxpayers to make energy-efficient choices, especially when replacing old equipment. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments are targeted at homeowners, who are typically higher-income individuals. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by taxpayers with an adjusted gross income above $50,000, who also claimed 89% of the total value of residential credits. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by taxpayers with an adjusted gross income above $50,000, who also claimed 89% of the total value of residential credits. Tax units with incomes below $50,000 make up nearly two-thirds of all tax units, with approximately one-quarter claiming residential energy tax credits. As income rises, the average amount of the residential credit also increases, with the highest income tax units receiving approximately seven times the average credit value of the lowest income tax units. The nonrefundability feature of the tax credits may limit who can claim these benefits. Tax units with the highest income level receive a credit approximately seven times higher than the lowest income tax unit. The nonrefundability feature of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits limits who can claim them. Section 25D credit can be carried forward, but Section 25C credit cannot. Taxpayers without enough tax liability in the current year cannot fully benefit from Section 25C credit. Those who eliminate tax liability through other incentives cannot benefit from certain residential energy-efficiency incentives. Taxpayers with high income levels receive significantly higher tax credits compared to lower-income taxpayers. The nonrefundability of certain tax credits limits who can claim them, with some credits unable to be carried forward. Taxpayers who eliminate their tax liability through other incentives are unable to benefit from residential energy-efficiency incentives. This limitation may undermine the effectiveness of using tax credits to encourage energy-efficiency investments. Tax credits can help reduce high upfront costs for households, but if only available to higher-income households, they may not effectively address market barriers. A simple tax code with low compliance costs can increase taxpayer participation in claiming benefits. However, there may be a trade-off between easy access to tax credits and overall taxpayer compliance. The IRS found opportunities for fraud in residential energy tax credits due to lack of verification for qualifying energy modifications made by claimants. The IRS could not verify if individuals claiming residential energy credits made qualifying modifications to their homes or if they were eligible for the credits. Tax forms did not require information or verification of expenses, leading to potential fraud. The IRS Form 5695, used to claim residential energy credits, did not verify eligibility, leading to potential fraud. TIGTA found that 30% of taxpayers claiming the credits may not have been homeowners. The IRS updated the form in 2011 to request more information about the taxpayer's home. In some cases, the IRS incorrectly denied eligible taxpayers $1.5 million in credits. The 25C credit is limited to $500, while the 25D credit has no monetary limit. In a recent report, TIGTA found that the IRS incorrectly denied almost 800 eligible taxpayers approximately $1.5 million in residential energy tax credits. The 25C credit is limited to $500, while the 25D credit has no monetary limit but cannot exceed the taxpayer's tax liability. TIGTA estimated that the $500 limit to the 25C credit was erroneously applied to the 25D credit, resulting in affected taxpayers being improperly denied the full credit amount. Congress has the option to allow these tax credits to expire as scheduled, with the Section 25C credit already expired in 2017 and the Section 25D credit set to expire in 2021. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits are temporary provisions that Congress may allow to expire as scheduled. Options for future incentives include modifying or replacing the credits with a grant program. Allowing the credits to expire may impact taxpayers' purchasing decisions based on the availability of credits. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits may expire as scheduled, impacting taxpayers' purchasing decisions. Policymakers have the option to extend, expand, or modify residential energy-efficiency tax incentives. Extending the credit with a $500-per-taxpayer cap may provide limited incentives for homeowners who have already claimed tax credits. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, as outlined in Appendix B, have evolved since their inception in 2005. Extending the credit with a $500-per-taxpayer cap may not provide sufficient incentives for homeowners who have already claimed tax credits. Expanding the credits by using a more generous formula, including more technologies, and removing caps could encourage more purchases and investments. The value of these credits increased significantly between 2007 and 2009, showing the potential benefits of expansion. Expansions of residential energy efficiency tax credits have shown significant growth between 2007 and 2009. Policymakers could consider scaling back these provisions by reinstating technology-specific caps, introducing an overall cap, or reducing caps on specific technologies. These changes may lead to confusion among taxpayers when estimating their credits. Additionally, phasing out credits for upper-income individuals could be another option. Policymakers may consider changes to residential energy efficiency tax credits, such as introducing overall caps or phasing out credits for upper-income taxpayers. Replacing these credits with a rebate program could be a more effective way to incentivize energy-efficient purchases. Policymakers may consider replacing residential energy efficiency tax credits with a rebate program to provide direct cash payments to consumers for eligible purchases, especially for those with limited funds or little tax liability. Legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to create a rebate program for contractors installing energy-efficient property. In 2010, legislation was introduced to create a rebate program for contractors installing energy-efficient property, called Home Star. The program aimed to provide rebates to consumers for eligible purchases, especially for those with limited funds or little tax liability. Appendix A provides technical standards for property to qualify for residential energy-efficiency tax credits. Legislative history shows that residential energy tax incentives were first introduced in the late 1970s and reintroduced in 2005. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation in the 1970s and 1980s. The credit had two components, with a maximum value of $2,500. In 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 increased the credit amount for renewable energy generation to a maximum of $4,000. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) created new tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property, effective for 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to claim credits for energy-efficiency improvements to their homes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced temporary tax credits for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to claim a nonrefundable tax credit of 10% of qualified expenditures for specific types of property, with varying credit limits. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) offered credits for specific property types, with varying limits. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500. Another credit, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), provided a 30% credit for expenditures on qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators. In 2006 and 2007, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) offered a 30% nonrefundable credit for qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators. The credit had annual limits, with a maximum of $2,000 for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties, and $500 for fuel cells. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, but Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432). The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the residential energy-efficient property credit for the 2008 tax year, clarifying that all solar energy properties could qualify. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the credit for the 2009 tax year, adding biomass fuel stoves as eligible for a $300 credit. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from the list of eligible properties under Section 25C but added to Section 25D. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year, adding biomass fuel stoves as eligible for a $300 credit. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from Section 25C but added to Section 25D, with the tax credit extended for eight years through 2016. The act also eliminated the $2,000 maximum annual credit limit for qualified solar-electric property expenditures and expanded the credit to include small wind-energy property expenditures. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the tax credit for qualified small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump property expenditures. The credit for small wind energy was 30% of expenditures up to a $4,000 annual cap, while the credit for geothermal heat pumps was 30% of expenditures up to a $2,000 annual cap. Taxpayers could claim the credits for both types of properties installed on their residential properties. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump property expenditures. Taxpayers were eligible for credits for both types of properties installed on their residential properties, with a 30% credit for small wind energy up to a $4,000 annual cap and a 30% credit for geothermal heat pumps up to a $2,000 annual cap. The Act further extended and modified the tax credits, including lifting the aggregate credit cap and eliminating the technology-specific credit amounts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump property expenditures, with changes including lifting the aggregate credit cap and eliminating technology-specific credit amounts. The Act also removed the $200 aggregate cap for windows in 2009 and 2010, allowing taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows. Additionally, the Act reduced efficiency standards for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, expanding the availability of the credit to more products. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and energy property, removing maximum credit caps for various technologies. The changes led to an increase in the number and total amount of credits claimed. However, when the ARRA expansions expired, the number of taxpayers claiming the residential energy credit decreased. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but reinstated the general lifetime limit and window lifetime limit. Taxpayers who had already claimed the maximum credits in previous years were ineligible to claim the credit in 2011. The Section 25C credit limits were reinstated, with a lifetime limit of $500 and a window lifetime limit of $200. Taxpayers who had already claimed the maximum credits in previous years were ineligible to claim the credit in 2011. Efficiency standards were restored to prior levels, and technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property were reinstated. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the credit for 2012 and 2013, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act extended it for 2014. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2012 and 2013, the Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended it for 2014, and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended and modified the credit for 2015 and 2016, requiring windows and doors to meet Energy Star 6.0 standards. The PATH Act extended the 25C credit for 2015 and 2016, requiring windows and doors to meet Energy Star 6.0 standards. Division P of P.L. 114-113 extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021 and modified the credit formula. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021, with a gradual reduction in the credit percentage from 30% in 2017 to 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies until the end of 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies like fuel cell plants, small wind energy property, and geothermal heat pump property through 2021. The credit rates for these technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, aligning with the rates for solar technologies."
