However, they do not have complete control over their music, as cover versions can be made under certain conditions. For example, Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify, but a cover version by Ryan Adams was still available. Copyright law allows for this as long as royalties are paid. Taylor Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings. However, as a songwriter who owns the rights to her musical works, she cannot control how the music service uses other recorded versions of her songs. The amount she gets paid for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and federal laws. Congress created these laws when music was primarily accessed through radio and physical media. The revenue Taylor Swift receives from her music is influenced by market forces, contracts, and federal copyright laws. Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address music distribution on the internet, aiming to combat piracy while protecting industry revenue sources. Different laws were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. The evolution of music distribution has blurred traditional lines of exploitation, with different copyright laws applied to digital services. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of the Napster file-sharing service. The evolution of music consumption over the last 40 years is illustrated in Figure 1. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion with the introduction of Napster. Apple launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003, marking the shift towards legal online music purchases. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales, with Apple dominating the market. However, sales from digital downloads started declining after 2012 due to the rise of streaming services like Spotify. The recording industry saw a shift in revenue sources as digital downloads surpassed physical media sales in 2012, with Apple holding a 65% market share. However, the rise of streaming services like Spotify led to a decline in digital downloads. To combat this trend, Apple launched Apple Music in 2015. Subscription music services have since changed music consumption patterns significantly, with a notable increase in spending from streaming services according to the RIAA. The rise of subscription music services has transformed music consumption patterns, with a significant increase in spending from streaming services according to the RIAA. Consumer spending on music remained flat between 2014 and 2015, then grew by 10% between 2015 and 2016, and by 14% between 2016 and 2017. Despite these changes, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers, adjusted for inflation, is still nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak, impacting how creators and artists are compensated under copyright law. Annual spending on music by U.S. consumers has grown significantly in recent years, but it is still below its 1999 peak. This impacts how creators and artists are compensated under copyright law, as they license their rights to third parties for exploitation. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work. Owners of musical works and certain sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work. This combination of rights is known as a \"mechanical right,\" dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for the reproduction of musical compositions. The term \"mechanical rights\" dates back to the 1909 Copyright Act, where music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for the reproduction of musical compositions. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, with works fixed before that date protected by state laws until February 15, 2067. Some music services have agreements to pay royalties for pre-1972 recordings. The Copyright Act protects sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Services like webcasting, SiriusXM, Pandora, and Spotify fall under this category. Audio transmissions such as webcasting, SiriusXM, Pandora, and Spotify fall under digital audio transmission services. Sound recording public performance rights are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on compact discs, while record labels pay music publishers for the right to distribute musical works. Retail outlets selling sound recordings pay for the rights to sell digital files or physical copies. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on compact discs, while record labels pay music publishers for the right to distribute musical works. Retail outlets selling sound recordings pay for the rights to sell digital files or physical copies. Radio listeners have less control over when and where they listen to a song than if they purchased it outright. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but it does require them to pay public performance royalties to music publishers and songwriters for notes and lyrics in broadcast music. The Copyright Act exempts broadcast radio stations from paying public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for broadcast music. Congress determined in 1995 that the promotional value of radio airplay outweighs revenue loss for record labels and artists. Digital services must pay both record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Both traditional radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners, known as \"ephemeral recordings\" under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Radio stations and music streaming services create temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners. These copies, known as \"ephemeral recordings,\" fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand through conditional downloads, where digital files are downloaded to consumers' devices. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters for the right to provide these services. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters work with music publishers to reproduce and distribute musical works. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute music. The music industry includes songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters collaborate with music publishers to promote songs, license intellectual property, and collect royalties. Publishers pay advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Their role is to monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music usage. Songwriters receive advances from publishers against future royalties and assign a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Publishers monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music usage in various formats. They may contract with performing rights organizations to collect payments for public performances. Royalty income is shared with subpublishers and coauthors. Contract terms for new songwriters are typically standardized. Music publishers contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Royalty income is shared with subpublishers and coauthors. Major publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the U.S. music publishing revenue. Multiple songwriters with their own publishers can complicate the division of income. The music publishing industry can be categorized into four main groups: Major Publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group, which control a significant portion of U.S. music publishing revenue. Major Affiliates work with independent publishing companies to manage songwriting creatively and handle royalty administration. Independent Publishers manage their own music catalogs without affiliating with major firms. Writer-Publishers, such as established songwriters or performers, control their own publishing rights. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights and may hire individuals to administer their royalties. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Major labels distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings through large networks. The distribution role of record labels is evolving. The largest record labels, known as \"majors,\" distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. They handle functions such as adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists can either contract with a label or distribute their own recordings. Recording artists may contract with record labels or retain their copyrights to distribute their own sound recordings. Contracts typically require artists to transfer copyrights to labels for defined periods and regions in exchange for royalties. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds to cover expenses, and guide artists' careers. Major stars may negotiate full ownership of future sound recording copyrights. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds to cover expenses, and guide artists' careers. Major stars may negotiate full ownership of future sound recording copyrights. The three major record labels earned about 65% of the industry's U.S. revenue: Sony Corporation (14.4%), Universal Music Group (29.4%), and Warner Music Group (21.2%). Each label shares a corporate parent with major music publishers. The music industry is dominated by major record labels like Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group. Independent artists like Chance the Rapper retain their copyrights and distribute their music without signing with a label. Chance gives away his music for free and earns money through touring and merchandise sales. Apple Music reportedly paid him $500,000. Chance the Rapper is an independent artist who retains his copyrights and distributes his music without signing with a record label. He gives away his music for free and earns money through touring and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights to his album, Coloring Book, which became the first streaming-only album to rank among the top 10 U.S. albums. Record producers are responsible for bringing creative music into tangible form, handling both creative and administrative tasks. In the past, record labels hired producers to produce entire albums. Record producers are responsible for bringing creative music into tangible form, handling both creative and administrative tasks. They work with recording artists to produce albums, with artists controlling the terms of compensation. Sound engineers run recording sessions under the producer's oversight, while mixers piece together polished finished products. Mixers typically receive one-time payments per track, but those in high demand may demand royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of the copyright owner to make mechanical reproductions of music. This act applied to musical works published and copyrighted after it took effect. A mechanical license allows for the audio-only reproduction of music using mechanical devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and CD players. The 1909 Copyright Act granted copyright owners the exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music, including player pianos and phonograph records. Concerns were raised about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company, which was buying up exclusive rights from music publishers to only work with their player pianos. In response to concerns about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company, Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allowed others to use sound recordings or player-piano rolls upon payment of a specified royalty. For example, when Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album in 2015, he did not need her permission but paid a compulsory mechanical license fee set by the government. In 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking her permission. Instead, he paid a compulsory mechanical license fee set by the government, as per the Copyright Act of 1976. The royalty rate was initially set at $0.02 per \"part manufactured\" under the 1909 Copyright Act, but later changed to a \"per song\" basis due to technological advancements in the music industry. Manufacturers extended the amount of music on records, increasing the number of songs per record. Congress revisited the mechanical license in the Copyright Act of 1976, specifying rates payable for each record made and distributed. The 1976 Copyright Act defined \"phonorecord\" for audio-only recordings and set procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses. Congress has since amended the law and changed the rate-setting process. The 1976 Copyright Act established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music recordings. Licensees must serve a notice of intention (NOI) to the copyright owner or the Copyright Office within 30 days of making a new recording. If the copyright owner cannot be located, licensees set aside money owed until they can pay the owners. The Act also made it easier for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements. It removed limitations on liability and made failing to provide a notice of intention (NOI) grounds for ineligibility for a compulsory license. Additionally, it eliminated the need for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" in order to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements by removing limitations on liability and the need for a \"notice of use\" to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. Failure to identify itself to the Copyright Office only precludes a copyright holder from receiving royalties under a compulsory license. This has led to controversy between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. The controversy between rights holders and licensees stems from the process of issuing licenses, with suggestions for periodic adjustments to the statutory mechanical royalty rate and the establishment of a separate royalty tribunal to simplify administration. In 1976, a separate royalty tribunal was established by Congress to simplify administering compulsory licenses and mechanical licenses. The tribunal, consisting of five commissioners appointed by the President, considers four policy objectives when setting royalty rates for mechanical licenses. These objectives include maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions of both parties, and minimizing disruptions. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set mechanical and other licensing rates every five years, replacing the previous tribunal. The CRB, composed of three judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress, aims to balance the interests of copyright owners and users while minimizing industry disruptions. Voluntary licenses can also be negotiated outside of statutory rates and terms. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), established in 2004, sets licensing rates every five years. It acts as a ceiling for what owners may charge, while voluntary licenses can be negotiated. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 amended U.S.C. Section 115 to cover digital transmission of musical works. Rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries are specified by Congress. The Copyright Office proposed new rules in 2008 to address the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission, specifically digital phonorecord deliveries. There was a debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD,\" prompting the need for resolution to ensure the survival of the music industry in the 21st Century. In July 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules, emphasizing the importance of resolving issues for the music industry's survival in the 21st Century. After years of hearings and litigation, music industry groups reached an agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming, addressing concerns about declining royalties from music streaming. The agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming in the music industry addressed concerns about declining royalties from music streaming. Music streaming services would pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive, audio-only streaming services would not need to obtain mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted a modified version of this agreement in 2009, with new rates and standards set in 2012 for additional categories of music streaming services. In 2012, music industry groups reached a new agreement on mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services, covering 2013-2017. The CRB set rates for physical phonorecord deliveries and permanent digital downloads, while interactive streaming rates are based on formulas considering the music service's revenues or licensing costs. In January 2018, the CRB issued initial rates for 2018-2022. For permanent digital downloads and interactive streaming, licensees pay flat rates based on formulas considering the music service's revenues or total licensing costs. The amount each publisher receives for mechanical royalty payments is determined by another set of formulas, with minimum per-subscriber payments for different music service categories. Mechanical royalty rates are zero during free trial periods. During free trial periods, mechanical royalty rates are zero. Public performance royalties are either overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission to perform musical works. In 1897, songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works, requiring establishments to obtain permission. To address the logistical issue of licensing and payment collection for public performances, composers formed ASCAP in 1914, a performance rights organization that issues licenses on behalf of songwriters. In 1914, composers formed ASCAP, a performance rights organization that collects payment for public performances. ASCAP issues public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers, who assign their rights to the PRO. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license to perform musical works for a fee. SESAC, a competing PRO founded in 1930, helps European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. After charging an administrative fee, PROs split public performance royalties among publishers and songwriters. In 1930, an immigrant musician founded SESAC to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. As radio grew more popular in the U.S., SESAC expanded to include U.S. composers. ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on a percentage of each station's advertising revenues. To strengthen their bargaining power, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers as members. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on advertising revenues. To compete, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. ASCAP and BMI initially had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses. ASCAP and BMI initially had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses. A dispute over royalty rates in 1940 led to radio stations boycotting ASCAP composers. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated both PROs for antitrust violations, leading to consent decrees in 1941. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated ASCAP and BMI for antitrust violations in 1941, leading to consent decrees. The decrees required the PROs to offer nonexclusive licenses, non-discriminatory terms, and accept any songwriter or music publisher that meets certain standards. ASCAP and BMI must offer nonexclusive licenses, non-discriminatory terms, and accept any songwriter or music publisher that meets certain standards. They are also required to offer alternative licenses and allow for determination of reasonable license fees by federal district court judges. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are subject to oversight, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace negotiations. The public performance of musical works by ASCAP and BMI is overseen by federal district court judges to ensure reasonable rates. SESAC and GMR negotiate rates independently. Judges must consider the disproportionate market power of ASCAP and BMI. Current law prohibits consideration of rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was included in the 1995 passage of the DPRA to dispel fears that license fees for sound recordings may affect music performance royalties. According to a report by the House Judiciary Committee, concerns were raised about the impact of license fees for sound recordings on music performance royalties. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have been periodically reviewed for effectiveness, with the last amendments made in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ's interpretation of the decrees. Congress initially created copyright laws specifically for sound recordings. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was enacted to address unauthorized duplications of sound recordings, following concerns about license fees for music performance royalties. It applied to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and was not preempted by federal copyright laws or the Constitution. The House Judiciary Committee report recommended amending federal copyright laws to combat record piracy. In 1971, the Sound Recording Act applied to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. States passed their own antipiracy laws, and in 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice suggested excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy measures. This exclusion was necessary to prevent works from automatically entering the public domain. The federal copyright laws exclude pre-1972 sound recordings to preserve antipiracy laws. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws equivalent to copyright but exempted pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt all state protection. Noninteractive digital services may make ephemeral server reproductions of sound recordings. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act to authorize the creation of temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rates and terms of this license are set by the CRB, and copyright owners receive Section 112 fees through SoundExchange. Recording artists also benefit from this arrangement. The Section 112 license under the Copyright Act governs incidental reproduction and distribution of musical works. Rates and terms are set by the CRB, with copyright owners receiving fees through SoundExchange. Recording artists without copyrights do not benefit. The recording industry faced challenges with music piracy in the 1990s, leading to amendments like the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act. The recording industry faced challenges with music piracy in the 1990s, leading to amendments like the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998. The DPRA granted record labels and recording artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services, and created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. The DPRA granted record labels and recording artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services, leading to debates on whether nonsubscription, advertising-supported, noninteractive streaming services were obligated to pay for the license. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, remained subject to the Section. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, remained subject to the Section 801(b)(1) standard, while webcasters and other noninteractive music streaming services entering the market after that date are subject to rates and terms reflecting marketplace negotiations. One key difference is the policy goal of minimizing disruptive impacts on the industries involved. The Section 801(b)(1) rate-setting standard applies to services existing before July 31, 1998, aiming to minimize disruptive impacts on industries. This standard led to lower copyright royalty rates in some cases, but its overall effect is hard to predict. The DPRA allowed owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance. The DPRA enabled owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance. The term \"interactive service\" refers to services allowing individuals to arrange specific recording transmissions. Interactive services may impact traditional record sales significantly. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 expressed concerns about how certain digital services could harm traditional record sales and impact copyright owners' ability to control and profit from their work. They highlighted that interactive services pose the greatest threat to record sales and the livelihoods of those dependent on them. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations, as they play a crucial role in promoting sound recordings and supporting performers' careers. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 emphasized the importance of broadcast radio stations in promoting sound recordings and supporting performers' careers. They highlighted the mutual beneficial relationship between the radio industry and the music industry, stating that legislation should not jeopardize this relationship. The Committee also distinguished broadcast radio from other services, noting that it provides a mix of entertainment and public interest programming to local communities. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates for music through rate determination proceedings. The Senate Judiciary Committee distinguished broadcast radio from other services, stating that it provides a mix of entertainment and public interest programming to local communities. The Copyright Royalty Board sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Participants engage in negotiations, submit written statements, conduct discovery, and attempt to reach a negotiated settlement during the proceedings. During rate-setting proceedings, parties engage in negotiations and submit written statements. If no agreement is reached, participants may propose statutory rates to the CRB for review. The CRB can adopt proposed rates or hold an evidentiary hearing to make a determination. Participants can request a rehearing if they disagree with the outcome. The CRB hears live testimony at an evidentiary hearing to determine statutory terms and rates for participants. If parties do not reach an agreement, the CRB issues a determination published in the Federal Register. Participants can request a rehearing or challenge CRB determinations through an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs, using the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard for per-performance rates. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs. The CRB sets per-performance rates for online music services and percentage-of-revenue rates for subscription and satellite services. Congress passed the Webcaster Settlement Acts to address complaints about excessive rates. Following complaints about excessive rates set by the CRB for music streaming services, Congress passed the Webcaster Settlement Acts, allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes based on a percentage of revenue. The most recent agreements expired in 2015, leading to the CRB setting new royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. The CRB set new royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020 after the expiration of the Webcaster Settlement Acts agreements in 2015. During the rate proceeding, questions arose about the interpretation of a provision barring consideration of agreements negotiated under the Acts. SoundExchange, Pandora Media, Inc., and Clear Channel disagreed on whether direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement could be used as evidence. The CRB, Pandora Media, and Clear Channel disputed the use of direct agreements in the rate proceeding after the expiration of the Webcaster Settlement Acts agreements. SoundExchange argued against using the agreements, while Pandora and Clear Channel contended that they should be considered. The CRB referred the matter to the Register of Copyrights for resolution, who ruled in September 2015 that directly negotiated licenses could be considered. The CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period, setting streaming services' fees at $0.17 per 100 streams for 2016. Annual rate increases from 2017 to 2020 are tied to the Consumer Price Index, and recording fees are now included with Section 114. The CRB set streaming services' fees at $0.17 per 100 streams for the 2016-2020 period, tying annual rate increases to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees are now included with Section 114 royalties, and the distribution of royalties collected under Section 114 is specified by the Copyright Act. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets rates for digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services from 2018-2022. Public performance royalties are distributed as follows: 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured recording artist, 2.5% to nonfeatured musicians' agent, and 2.5% to nonfeatured vocalists' agent. Record producers are not included in the royalty split unless directed by the artist to SoundExchange for compensation. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services has been a matter of debate in defining the process for setting rates for public performance rights. Producers can be compensated for public performances via SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services for setting rates for public performance rights is defined by 17 U.S.C. Sections 114 and 115. The CRB uses these distinctions to set rates for mechanical licenses. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on this matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in 2009 that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not considered an \"interactive\" service for obtaining mechanical licenses. This decision aimed to protect sound recording copyright holders from losing sales. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in 2009 that a music streaming service, like LAUNCHcast, creating unique playlists for users is not considered an \"interactive\" service for obtaining mechanical licenses, aiming to protect sound recording copyright holders from losing sales. The court determined that LAUNCHcast, an online radio service, was noninteractive as it provided unique playlists for users but did not guarantee predictability. Noninteractive services must limit features to be eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. This includes not announcing in advance when specific songs will be played. Noninteractive music streaming services, like Pandora and iHeartRadio, can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. These services are restricted in announcing specific songs in advance and are subject to limits on the number of tracks played from a single album or artist within a three-hour period. In contrast, Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists for free. The current rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board do not differentiate between personalized streaming services and those that transmit radio-style programming online. The Copyright Royalty Board's rates do not distinguish between personalized streaming services like Spotify and other online radio-style services. Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists for free with ads, or ad-free listening for a monthly fee. Congress provided antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate collectively with services like SiriusXM. The 1995 antitrust exemptions allowed copyright owners to designate common agents to negotiate royalty rates with services like SiriusXM. The exemptions aim to prevent copyright owners from demanding supracompetitive rates and preserve the ability to negotiate directly with operators. The DPRA does not create antitrust exemptions for interactive services. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. Copyright owners and entities can use common agents for clearinghouse functions, not rate-setting. Section 112 of the DMCA allows designated common agents to negotiate royalty payments for ephemeral recordings. In 1998, the DMCA added Section 112 for ephemeral server reproductions by webcasters and online services, providing an antitrust exemption for royalty payments. The CRB was created in 2004 with provisions on licensee payments. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 with provisions on licensee payments, allowing a government entity to designate an agent to receive royalties. This provision ensures that parties subject to statutory licensing continue to make payments while appealing CRB decisions on royalty rates. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" in 2006, allowing parties to make payments while appealing royalty rate decisions. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary, requested recognition as a collective as well. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective from the CRB to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are designated agents, not entities like Royalty Logic. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are designated agents, not entities like Royalty Logic, for involvement in the royalty distribution process. The CRB found that selecting a single collective was the most efficient system for collecting royalties under statutory licenses. The CRB found that selecting a single collective was the most efficient system for collecting royalties under statutory licenses, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. Royalty Logic argued against this decision based on Congress's use of the word \"nonexclusive\" in the relevant statutes. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments for the statutory license, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single collective. This decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for receiving royalty payments, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single entity. This decision was based on efficiency and economic reasons, with no other parties requesting multiple collectives. SoundExchange also reached agreements with public and college radio stations in 2015, which were approved by the CRB and binding on all copyright owners and performers. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting royalties under statutory licenses, with agreements reached with public and college radio stations in 2015. The CRB approved these agreements, making them binding on all copyright owners and performers. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for managing sound recording royalties from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020, due to its administrative and technical expertise. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for managing sound recording royalties from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating mechanical licenses. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, which distributes the royalties to songwriters after charging an administrative fee. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in 2015. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and collecting mechanical royalties. The CRB has not designated an agent for administering mechanical licenses. Noncash considerations may influence the price that interactive services pay for music access. Major labels acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify. Noncash considerations may influence the price that interactive services pay for music access, such as major labels acquiring an 18% equity stake in Spotify. Sony sold a portion of its stake when Spotify began trading shares, sharing proceeds with artists and independent labels. Rates paid by interactive services to music publishers are tied to rates paid to record labels for performance rights.
