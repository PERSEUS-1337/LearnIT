    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership for a nationwide broadband network by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The FCC proposed setting aside 10 MHz of public safety spectrum to create a shared network with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum, aiming to meet public safety needs and provide new funding sources and benefits. The FCC proposed sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users to benefit public safety by providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. A national license for 10 MHz was assigned to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests, created from the 24 MHz originally designated for public safety. This license is administered by a Public Safety Broadband Licensee chosen by the FCC. The FCC designated 10 MHz of frequencies for public safety to be paired with their existing 10 MHz, creating a shared network. The commercial license for the D Block was auctioned off but only received one bidder, Qualcomm, Inc., who did not meet the FCC's reserve price of $1.3 billion. The D Block license auctioned by the FCC in March 2008 attracted only one bidder, Qualcomm, Inc., who did not meet the reserve price of $1.3 billion. The FCC decided not to proceed with a re-auction, initiating a review of rules and proposing new auction rules for the D Block. The FCC proposed new auction rules for the D Block after the failed auction in March 2008. The rules include a single nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and options for commercial licenses in either national or regional coverage. Public safety associations have requested local public safety networks to operate on the public safety spectrum. The FCC proposed new auction rules for the D Block, offering a national license or smaller licenses for 58 regions. Public safety associations want local networks to manage access to the public safety spectrum. The national licensee would ensure common standards while allowing local networks to negotiate sharing arrangements. Congressional policy debates combining public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communications support. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for this communication response. The auction aims to combine public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communications support. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for this communication response, without incorporating each other's goals. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. An economic stimulus program could include funding for public safety networks. The FCC proposes resolving public safety communication needs through levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. An economic stimulus program could include funding for critical infrastructure improvements, including public safety networks. The federal government could temporarily act as the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users is seen as beneficial for public safety, providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The general agreement is that sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety by providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The report assumes three needs for an effective solution: sufficient spectrum for a broadband network (at least 20 MHz), a source of funds, and identification of unavoidable costs for public safety. The key elements for an effective solution in creating a nationwide broadband network for public safety include sufficient spectrum (at least 20 MHz), a source of funds to cover unavoidable costs, and a management structure involving a public-private partnership and network sharing agreement. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership in managing a shared network for commercial and emergency use. Incentives are needed for commercial partners to meet public safety standards, despite high demand for mobile data access in the business sector. The FCC discusses the need for a public-private partnership to build a network meeting public safety standards, despite high demand for mobile data access in the business sector. The debate surrounding the failed auction of the D Block license includes discussions on flaws in the auction structure and potential solutions for an interoperable public safety broadband network. The debate surrounding the failed auction of the D Block license includes discussions on flaws in the auction structure and potential solutions for an interoperable public safety broadband network. Suggestions include modifying auction rules to attract more bidders and considering alternatives to the current public-private partnership structure. The debate on the failed auction of the D Block license involves discussions on flaws in the auction structure and potential solutions for a public safety broadband network. Suggestions include changing auction rules to attract more bidders and exploring alternatives to the current public-private partnership. This includes eliminating network sharing requirements, empowering public safety to negotiate independently, and auctioning the D Block license without public safety requirements. The proposal also involves using federal funds to build a public safety network, assuming there is adequate spectrum capacity and a management structure in place. Congressional action would be required to authorize expenditures for this plan. The debate on the failed auction of the D Block license involves discussions on flaws in the auction structure and potential solutions for a public safety broadband network. Suggestions include changing auction rules to attract more bidders and exploring alternatives to the current public-private partnership. Use federal funds to build a public safety network, requiring congressional action to authorize expenditures. Different organizational structures for managing a public safety network are proposed, which may require legislation for the organizational structure. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions in its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions for the failed auction of the D Block license. Suggestions include changing auction rules to attract more bidders and exploring alternatives to the current public-private partnership. The FCC commissioners support re-auctioning the D Block under new rules to provide a commercial partner for public safety. They intend to increase oversight in supervising the public-private partnership. Rule changes for the auction could include modifications for the winning bidder, such as lowering the reserve price or eliminating financial penalties. The FCC intends to maintain oversight in the public-private partnership for the D Block auction. Rule changes may include modifying requirements for the winning bidder, re-auctioning without encumbrances, and eliminating the network sharing agreement. Some proposals suggest eliminating encumbrances for the D Block auction, such as costly rebanding provisions and network sharing agreements. It is recommended to re-auction the D Block without these restrictions and use surplus funds from previous auctions to build a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin mentioned the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act as a potential funding source for public safety communications. Many suggest using surplus funds from previous auctions, like Auction 73, to build a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer a solution using federal funds for a nationwide, interoperable network. Without federal support, the FCC aims to use private sector funds. Recommendations for funding a nationwide interoperable network lack specific details on fund allocation. The FCC is seeking a solution for a nationwide interoperable network using private sector funds. Recommendations for funding lack specific details on fund distribution. A cooperative organization involving multiple public safety partners would build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for regional, state, and local networks to connect during emergencies. This would require less financial commitment from commercial partners and more involvement from state and local agencies. The public-private partnership aims to create an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for emergency use, with state and local agencies playing a key role. Commercial partners would have a smaller financial commitment but lead in investment decisions. Multiple commercial partners could be involved instead of a single D Block partner. The commercial network, with multiple partners, would lead in investment and technology decisions for the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. Public safety partners would design the network and set technology standards for commercial partners. Federal funds would be administered through existing programs within the Department of Homeland Security. The FCC could set standards as the network designer for commercial partners in a network sharing agreement. Federal funds from the Department of Homeland Security could be used to build the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role would be minimized, with support through funding and identifying federal programs as network customers. A federally chartered corporation could ensure broad-based participation of public safety agencies. The federal government could ensure the economic viability of the public safety network by identifying federal programs as network customers. A federally chartered corporation could hire professionals to operate the network, with funding coming from appropriations or other sources. The Public Safety Broadband License could remain with the current holder or be reassigned, with laws governing corporate conduct replacing FCC oversight. The FCC seeks opinions and information on creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block, with the assistance of Congress. Without additional authority from Congress, the FCC is limited to directing the outcome through modifications to spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and network sharing agreements.

Without additional authority from Congress, the FCC is limited to directing the outcome through modifications to spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and network sharing agreements. The FCC is exploring provisions and eligibility for using the Public Safety Broadband License, revisions to the public-private partnership, negotiation of the Network Sharing Agreement, structuring the new auction of the D Block, relocation costs and deadlines for changes in 700 MHz frequency assignments, service rules for the D Block, and other opportunities for providing broadband wireless access for public safety. The FCC is seeking opinions on creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would borrow $197 million for capital expenditures, including network administration and customer care for public safety customers. The FCC is also exploring other sources of funding for operating costs. The FCC is exploring funding options for operating costs of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, including the possibility of using the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. Congressional amendments may be needed to utilize these funds. The Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) provides capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry through loans or investments. It is funded by assessments on telephone bills and interest accrued on FCC deposits. Congressional amendments may be required to modify existing statutes governing the fund's use. The FCC has established key provisions for Auction 73, including financial requirements for bidders and setting aside licenses for specific classes. The FCC established key provisions for Auction 73, including financial requirements for bidders and setting aside licenses for specific classes. Service rules for advanced wireless services typically include requirements for license usage within a specific timeframe and can specify technologies, uses, or users. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to include spectrum sharing for public safety. The FCC expanded service rules for Auction 73 to include spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees, establishing a public-private partnership for the 700 MHz band auction. The rules mandate commercial licensees to build a network to meet public safety and commercial needs. The FCC established service rules for a public-private partnership in preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. The regulatory framework includes requirements for a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a Commercial partner, and a Network Sharing Agreement to build and manage a shared network. The FCC established service rules for a public-private partnership in preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. This includes requirements for a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a Commercial partner, and a Network Sharing Agreement to build and manage a shared network. The components must meet FCC guidelines, with contracts and agreements subject to FCC approval, compliance oversight, and dispute resolution through the FCC or litigation. The FCC's Second Report and Order highlights issues for policy makers regarding public safety communications. The FCC's Second Report and Order established service rules for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction. It allocated 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety use, transitioning from analog to digital television. Planning began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee. The transition from analog to digital television allocated 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety use at 700 MHz. Planning started in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the final report of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee. The governance for these frequencies involves Regional Planning Committees coordinated by the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council. The band plan has been revised to accommodate changes in technology and public safety needs. The band plan at 700 MHz for public safety radio traffic has been revised to create two licensing approaches - one for narrowband and one for broadband applications. Channels have been reassigned to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum. RPCs with approved band plans must submit amended plans as per FCC rules. Financing for networks on narrowband frequencies will follow existing procedures. The FCC has revised the band plan at 700 MHz for public safety radio traffic, creating two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. Channels will support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum, with financing through a combination of local, state, and federal funds. Spectrum will also be allocated for broadband communications in 10 MHz of frequencies, with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee responsible for administering guard bands to prevent interference. The FCC has revised the band plan at 700 MHz for public safety radio traffic, creating two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. The frequencies 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz will be assigned to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, who will also administer guard bands to prevent interference. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with some costs covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The public safety licensee must meet requirements including forming a not-for-profit corporation, establishing standards, and participating in the Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC has revised the band plan at 700 MHz for public safety radio traffic, creating two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee will be responsible for holding the license and forming a not-for-profit corporation to meet requirements, establish standards, and participate in the Network Sharing Agreement. The cost of building the national network using the spectrum would be covered by its commercial partner, with system enhancements potentially funded by the public sector. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit corporate status and broad representation of public safety entities. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a not-for-profit corporation with broad representation of public safety entities, to hold the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License. The Board of Directors consists of members from designated organizations and two at-large members, totaling 13 members. The FCC changed the composition of the Board of Directors of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, adding three representatives from named organizations, eliminating one representative, and increasing the number of at-large members from two to four. Four at-large members were selected jointly by FCC bureaus. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) was eliminated as a named member due to membership overlap with other associations. The FCC changed the composition of the Board of Directors of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, adding three representatives from named organizations and increasing at-large members to four. NPSTC was removed as a member due to membership overlap. PSST, as the selected licensee, would need to file quarterly financial reports with the FCC. The FCC would provide oversight to ensure compliance with incorporation and bylaws criteria. The FCC requires the licensee to meet criteria for incorporation and bylaws, with oversight to ensure compliance. The FCC has the authority to re-assign or revoke the license if necessary. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign or revoke the D Block license if cooperation is unsatisfactory. The public safety license is valid for ten years and can be renewed, with additional tasks set by the FCC.

The FCC requires the winning bidder of the D Block license to form separate legal entities that are \"bankruptcy remote\" to lease secondary rights to the public safety spectrum. These entities must be approved by the FCC and comprised of quasi-independent companies with designated functions, subject to the Communications Act and the Commission's rules and regulations. The public-private partnership for the D Block license involves a corporate structure of quasi-independent companies with designated functions, subject to the Communications Act and FCC regulations. These entities are responsible for building out the shared network as outlined in the Network Sharing Agreement and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could result in license revocation and penalties. The D Block license must meet FCC rules and network build out deadlines to avoid revocation and penalties. The license is valid for ten years and can be renewed if rules are followed. The commercial corporation formed must build the public safety network as required by the FCC. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build out of the public safety network using spectrum held by the D Block license holder. The network should reach 75% of the population within four years, 95% within seven years, and 99.3% within ten years. Modifications to requirements are subject to approval by all parties involved, including the FCC. The FCC set benchmarks for a population-based build-out of the public safety network using D Block spectrum. The network should cover 75% of the population within four years, 95% within seven years, and 99.3% within ten years. Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. The FCC required the D Block licensee to meet population coverage benchmarks for public safety network build-out. Failure to meet deadlines could lead to license cancellation. The licensee must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for rural areas and ensure robust signal carriage for population coverage requirements. The NSA would establish service requirements for public safety users and network performance. The licensee is prohibited from discontinuing or degrading service to the public. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) was created as the keystone of the public-private partnership, ensuring robust signal carriage for population coverage requirements. The FCC would review and approve all components of the NSA, with requirements set for service to public safety users and network performance. The D Block licensee is prohibited from discontinuing or degrading service to public safety customers without approval. The FCC requires the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) to be a contractual partnership between two licensees, with set rules and conditions for commercial and public safety service. The agreement must meet network coverage requirements and include specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data for public safety and commercial use. The FCC reviews and approves all components of the NSA to ensure it meets public safety needs and promotes communications interoperability. The FCC established requirements for the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) to meet public safety needs, including specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data, interoperability across agencies, signal coverage reliability, robustness, capacity during emergencies, and heavy usage. The FCC expects public safety networks to have features like hardened facilities, backup power, spectrum efficient technologies, security measures, and automatic prioritization of communications. These networks should also meet current and future operational needs, such as push-to-talk capabilities. Automatic prioritization of public safety communications over commercial uses in real time, with the highest priorities given to safety of life and property, and homeland security. Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the network to ensure safety requirements are met, including approving equipment specifications and purchasing subscriber equipment.

The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has the right to approve equipment specifications and purchase subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide integrated handsets for public safety use. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users. FCC rules stipulate guidelines for the Network Sharing Agreement, including fee structures and service fees. The FCC rules require the parties to negotiate in good faith to create the Network Sharing Agreement, which must specify all service fees, including those for normal network service and priority access to commercial spectrum capacity during emergencies. The FCC suggests that reasonable rates should include financial incentives for the commercial licensee based on the number of public safety subscribers and structured priority access fees to protect public safety participants from unexpected payment obligations. Affordable rates are also encouraged. The FCC expects the fee structure to provide financial incentives for commercial licensees based on the number of public safety subscribers and to protect public safety participants from unforeseen payment obligations. Affordable rates are encouraged, with lower rates for public safety. The D Block licensee should negotiate fees that align with public safety goals. The Network Sharing Agreement will be in effect for up to ten years from February 17, 2009, with tools available to resolve disputes over fees. The FCC reiterated tools to resolve disputes over fees in the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA), which would be in effect for up to ten years from February 17, 2009. The NSA may be renewed along with the D Block license, with any modifications requiring approval from the FCC Commissioners or Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety and Homeland Security. The FCC considers renewing the D Block license and approving modifications to the NSA or other agreements in the public-private partnership structure. Approval must be obtained in advance of any action, with both licensee partners agreeing to the modifications. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease access to frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee on a secondary, unconditionally preemptible basis. Commercial users on the D Block network can transmit on public safety band frequencies only when there is no demand from primary public safety users, yielding immediately to public safety demands. The D Block licensee has secondary access to public safety band frequencies, allowing commercial users to transmit only when there is no demand from primary public safety users. This access is part of the public-private partnership agreements, with the responsibility for compliance placed on the D Block license holder. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to lease spectrum and build a network for public safety use, with a ten-year lease term. The lessee must ensure no interference with public safety users and prioritize first responders on the network. Public safety retains real-time access rights in exchange for allowing commercial usage of the bandwidth. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to prioritize first responders on the network and provide real-time access rights for public safety in exchange for allowing commercial usage of the bandwidth in the public safety spectrum band. The definition of an emergency and access to D Block frequencies are outlined in the service rules attached to the D Block license. If an agreement on what constitutes an emergency cannot be reached, the public safety licensee can appeal to the FCC for access to D Block frequencies. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. This allowed for a shared spectrum agreement between the public safety community and the private sector. Other spectrum management issues were also resolved by the FCC. Additionally, the FCC made decisions that required technical adjustments to equipment and software for networks in the preliminary stages of build out. The FCC made decisions regarding the operation of public safety networks in the 700 MHz band, including requiring technical adjustments for networks in the preliminary stages of build out, capping reimbursement costs at $10 million, and prohibiting new operations of narrowband systems on relocated networks. The new band plan created separate sets of paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband communications. The FCC has set new band plans for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band, with separate spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband communications. Some states have started building narrowband networks on the 700 MHz capacity, but frequencies need to be vacated by February 17, 2009 for broadband use. Base stations and radios may need modifications for the new network. The FCC has mandated the rebanding of frequencies in the 700 MHz band for broadband use by February 17, 2009. Motorola estimated the cost of rebanding at $9.45 million, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million set by the FCC to control costs. Motorola estimated the cost of rebanding at $9.45 million, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million set by the FCC to control costs. The FCC ruled that only systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, would be covered to keep costs below the cap. This would limit the number of base stations and radios needing reprogramming, with an estimated cost of around $6 million. The FCC estimated rebanding costs at around $6 million, with a cap of $10 million to control expenses. New operations on affected frequencies were prohibited after August 30, 2007, and rules were set for calculating actual costs and reimbursements. Licensees had to reach agreements on relocation plans and costs within 30 days to receive reimbursement. The public safety licensee and commercial D Block licensee must reach an agreement on relocation and rebanding costs within 30 days, approved by the FCC. Displaced public safety network operators must provide specific information for reimbursement, including details on mobile and portable handsets, base stations, and operational areas. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing costs. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing costs related to relocation and rebanding of mobile and portable handsets, base stations, and operational areas. The FCC does not require the licensee to cover costs for unrelated improvements or changes to Regional Planning Committee plans. Reimbursement for Public Safety Broadband Licensee's costs may be possible. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing costs related to relocation and rebanding, not exceeding $10 million. The amount must be agreed upon by the D Block licensee and public safety licensee, certified by relevant parties, and paid into a trust account established by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The public safety licensee will administer the account. The winning bidder for the D Block license must pay the negotiated amount into a trust account established by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee before the Network Sharing Agreement is executed. The public safety licensee will administer the account and make payments according to the agreed schedule. Payments cannot be made until the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder, who will be provisional until all FCC requirements are met. Public safety network operators need a waiver to operate wideband systems, requiring an application and authorization from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC requires the winning bidder of the D Block license to meet all requirements before becoming the provisional winner. Public safety network operators must obtain a waiver to operate wideband systems within narrowband frequencies, with specific conditions and transition plans in place. Wideband operations in broadband frequencies are generally not permitted, and devices used on the wideband network must be interoperable. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks. It will monitor and regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the companies managing the obligations of the D Block license holder. Congressional oversight of the public-private partnership will be established. The FCC, under the Communications Act, will regulate the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and companies managing the D Block license. Congressional oversight will be within the telecommunications committees' jurisdiction. The FCC will oversee the network operation with an asset value in the tens of billions of dollars, controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, governed by its Board of Directors, will oversee a network with an asset value in the tens of billions of dollars. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act. Congress will provide guidance to FCC commissioners through legislation. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address specific issues. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address specific issues related to creating a shared network, including the Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055) which would provide funding for operating expenses and promoting a nationwide public safety communications network. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation or license revocation. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 would provide funding for a nationwide public safety communications network, with grants available in the form of FCC grants. The bill also authorizes an additional $2 million for promoting the network and puts limits on the activities of the public safety license-holder. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 would create a trust fund to purchase interoperable radios for the new network. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker) aims to establish a First Responders Interoperable Device Availability Trust Fund to provide grants for purchasing interoperable radios for the proposed public safety network. The Act would allocate proceeds from the auction of the D Block spectrum and future auctions to the Trust Fund, ensuring revenue for the Federal Communication Commission's auctions."
