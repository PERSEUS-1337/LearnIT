Table 15 shows the 10 S&E occupations with the most projected job openings, including computer occupations, engineering occupations, and mathematical occupations, accounting for 60.8% of all projected job openings in S&E occupations. The 10 S&E occupations with the fewest projected job openings represent less than 1% of all S&E job openings. These occupations span across life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics, and are crucial for U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and societal needs. The U.S. science and engineering workforce is crucial for technological leadership, innovation, and societal needs. Congress has enacted programs to support education in STEM fields and improve skills for more students to pursue S&E degrees. Policymakers are considering changes in visa and immigration policies to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers working in the United States. Some policymakers aim to boost the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the US through visa and immigration policy changes. Views on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce vary among policymakers, business leaders, and others, with differing opinions on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers in the US and if government intervention is necessary. There are varying perspectives on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce in the US, with debates on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers. Some believe a shortage exists, which could impact US leadership in various sectors, while others argue there is no shortage and market forces should dictate the labor market. The debate over the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce in the US continues, with some arguing for a shortage of scientists and engineers that could affect US leadership in various sectors. However, data does not support claims of a broad shortage, and regardless of shortage, increasing the number of scientists and engineers will boost innovation, economic performance, and job creation. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is crucial for innovation, economic performance, and job creation, even if there is no current shortage. S&E degrees provide valuable skills for various occupations, and government interventions to address shortages may introduce inefficiencies. Government interventions to increase the number of scientists and engineers may lead to inefficiencies in the labor market, such as over-education and lower salaries for graduates. Workforce projections for S&E occupations are unreliable and may result in mismatches between education and market needs. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to various factors such as technological changes, market shifts, and labor market demographics. Shortages may occur in certain industries or fields, leading to mismatches between education and market needs. Shortages in S&E occupations can be caused by various factors like changes in prices, retirement behavior, foreign labor availability, demographics, and government policies. Shortages may exist in specific industries or fields, such as new emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology. The labor market will address these needs through wage adjustments, increased labor supply, and substitution of alternative inputs. The potential adverse consequences of shortages in S&E occupations require government interventions to increase supply. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to lower labor costs and maintain technological leadership. Industry claims of shortages in S&E fields are primarily motivated by a desire to reduce costs and maintain technological leadership. The real issue lies in a skills mismatch rather than a shortage of people. Employers struggle to meet their workforce needs due to a mismatch between the specific skills required and those possessed by S&E workers. Expanding immigration can help address these shortages. Expanding immigration can help address the skills mismatch in meeting S&E workforce needs, particularly in information technology. Immigration policies aimed at increasing foreign scientists and engineers in the U.S. can utilize the talents of the world's best, reduce brain drain, but may also reduce market signals for U.S. students to pursue science and engineering. Expanding immigration to address S&E workforce needs may reduce market signals for U.S. students to pursue science and engineering degrees. U.S. students lag behind foreign students in STEM knowledge, requiring federal efforts to improve STEM education. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. as students lag behind their foreign counterparts in STEM knowledge. This disparity may lead to fewer talented scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Standardized tests do not accurately reflect the STEM knowledge of U.S. students, highlighting the need for stronger K-12 STEM education programs. The disparity in STEM knowledge between U.S. K-12 students and their foreign counterparts calls for federal efforts to improve STEM education. Standardized tests do not accurately reflect the preparedness of U.S. students for pursuing S&E degrees and occupations, leading to various opinions on federal policies to enhance the S&E workforce and increase diversity in science and engineering fields. The curr_chunk discusses strategies to bolster U.S. competitiveness in science and engineering, including increasing foreign scientists, improving diversity, enhancing STEM education, and providing career counseling. It also includes data on the educational composition of S&E occupations. The BLS publishes data on the educational composition of S&E occupations using ACS data. The charts illustrate the occupational composition based on educational levels, including a category for \"Less than an Associate's degree\" which includes various education levels below an associate's degree."
