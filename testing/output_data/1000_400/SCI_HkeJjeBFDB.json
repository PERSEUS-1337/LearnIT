To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing generalization and robustness goals. Noise is crucial for improving neural networks training and enhancing generalization and robustness. Introducing variability through noise at input or supervision levels can lead to significant improvements in model performance. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" demonstrate how noise can enhance generalization and robustness in models.

In the study, different types of noise are injected into the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation to analyze their impact on model generalization and robustness. Signal-dependent noise is added to the output logits for this analysis. In CIFAR-C, noise is added to the output logits in the student-teacher learning framework to analyze its impact on model generalization and robustness.

Training the student model with dropout using our scheme significantly improves generalization on unseen and out-of-distribution data. The method involves using the teacher model's logits with activated dropout to train the student for more epochs, capturing the uncertainty of the teacher directly. The performance of the student model continues to improve even as the teacher model's performance decreases after a dropout rate of 0.2. Adding trial-to-trial variability through dropout improves generalization for the student model, even when the teacher model's performance decreases. Injecting noise like Gaussian or Laplace noise enhances adversarial robustness, as shown by Pinot et al. Theoretical evidence by Pinot et al. suggests that injecting Gaussian noise in the input image improves adversarial robustness but reduces generalization. A novel method is proposed to add Gaussian noise while distilling knowledge to the student model, aiming to retain robustness without sacrificing generalization. Our method involves training the student model with random Gaussian noise using the teacher model trained on clean images to retain adversarial robustness and mitigate generalization loss. By minimizing a specific loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, we observed increased adversarial robustness and decreased generalization compared to models trained with Gaussian noise alone. Our approach outperforms compact models trained with Gaussian noise without teacher assistance in terms of both generalization and robustness. Our proposed method enhances adversarial robustness and generalization by training models with Gaussian noise levels. It outperforms compact models trained without teacher assistance, showing significant improvements in robustness to common corruptions. The method achieves 33.85% adversarial robustness at lower noise intensity compared to 3.53% for the student model alone. Robustness to noise and blurring corruptions increases with Gaussian noise intensity, while weather corruptions show improved robustness except for fog and frost. Digital corruptions also exhibit enhanced robustness except for contrast and saturation.

The proposed regularization technique introduces label noise to prevent overgeneralization in deep neural networks by randomly relabeling samples, encouraging cautious predictions and reducing memorization. Previous studies have focused on improving DNN tolerance to noisy labels, but exploring random label noise as constructive noise for model generalization is novel. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization. When corruption is only used during knowledge distillation to the student model, generalization improves even at high corruption levels. However, when corruption is used during training the teacher model and then used for training the student model, generalization decreases. The study shows that knowledge distillation to the student model improves generalization even with high corruption levels. However, when corruption is used during training the teacher model and then for training the student model, generalization decreases. Random label corruption significantly increases adversarial robustness, with a peak at 40% corruption. This phenomenon warrants further investigation. The PGD-20 robustness of the teacher model increases from 0% to 10.89%, seen for Corrupted-T and Corrupted-TS. Adversarial robustness increases up to 40% random label corruption and slightly decreases at 50%.

The goal is to minimize Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities. Neural networks generalize well when test data matches training data distribution. However, real-world models often face domain shift, impacting generalization. Test set performance alone isn't enough to evaluate generalization. Out-of-distribution performance measured using ImageNet images from CINIC dataset. To evaluate the generalization of models in a test environment, out-of-distribution performance is crucial. ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset are used for this purpose, approximating a model's performance on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their real-world deployment. Robustness against these attacks has become a significant focus in research. Neural networks are vulnerable to imperceptible perturbations that can deceive them, posing a threat to their real-world deployment. Research focuses on evaluating and defending against adversarial attacks using methods like Projected Gradient Descent. In evaluating adversarial robustness, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack is used with random noise within an epsilon bound. The attack moves in the direction of loss with a step size and clips it within the epsilon bound and valid image range. The model needs to defend against worst-case distribution shifts for security. In experiments, operator d (A) denotes element-wise clipping to a specified range. Adversarial robustness is crucial for security, but the model also needs to be robust to natural perturbations. Recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to real-world perturbations, not just adversarial examples. Hendrycks et al. (2019) curated real-world examples that degrade classifier accuracy, while Gu et al. (2019) measured natural robustness to minute transformations in video frames. In their study, Gu et al. (2019) found that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to natural transformations in video frames. In our study, we use robustness to common corruptions in CIFAR-C as a proxy for natural robustness. The study by Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019) examines common corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C as a measure of natural robustness. It is important to balance generalization and adversarial robustness in model training, considering the impact on in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, as well as robustness to natural perturbations and distribution shifts. Adversarially trained models may negatively affect natural robustness, as shown by Ding et al. (2019) and Yin et al. (2019). In the adversarial literature, studies have shown a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. However, these findings may not apply to the general robustness of the model.
