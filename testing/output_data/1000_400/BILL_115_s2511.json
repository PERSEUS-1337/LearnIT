    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018.\" The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" outlines definitions, coordination, assessment, acquisition, and reporting related to unmanned maritime systems for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Key terms include \"Administration\" referring to NOAA and \"Administrator\" as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The \"Administration\" refers to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, while the \"Administrator\" is the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. \"Cooperative activities of the Administration\" involve collaborations with external entities like Cooperative Institutes, Sea Grant Colleges, and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The term \"test or training range\" refers to designated areas for operating unmanned maritime systems and other systems to evaluate performance or train personnel on operating procedures. Data specifications refer to the type, resolution, periodicity, and quality of data required by programs of the Administration. The term \"test or training range\" designates areas for operating unmanned maritime systems and other systems to evaluate performance or train personnel. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence and may include control, communications, instrumentation, data transmission, and processing systems. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence. Examples include unmanned undersea vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and autonomous surface vehicles. The term also includes unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime issues. The Administrator directs the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to coordinate the research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems, including aerial vehicles. The Administrator directs the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to coordinate the Administration's research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems. This includes considering the use of unmanned maritime systems in cooperative activities and utilizing the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board for coordination within the Administration. The Administrator directs coordination of unmanned maritime systems research and acquisition through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board, involving various offices within the Administration. Coordination with the Navy is also emphasized in carrying out the Act. The Administrator coordinates unmanned maritime systems research and acquisition through various offices within the Administration and with the Navy. Coordination includes leveraging Navy expertise, aligning with strategic priorities, and utilizing Naval test ranges. The Secretary of Commerce for Operations and the Oceanographer of the Navy collaborate on strategic priorities, utilizing Naval unmanned systems test ranges and promoting interagency cooperation. Coordination includes incorporating Administration priorities into Navy research and development activities. The Secretary of the Navy collaborates with the Administration on priorities for research and development activities, procurement of unmanned maritime systems, and access to test ranges and facilities. Other topics may include mapping and bathymetry. The Administrator collaborates with the Navy to access test ranges and facilities for various purposes, including mapping, bathymetry, observations, and ocean exploration. Activities are carried out at a co-located facility to enhance collaboration and advance unmanned maritime systems development through research, testing, modifications, and integration. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate to advance unmanned maritime systems development by gaining efficiencies, accelerating transition from concept to manufacturing, and utilizing the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination. They may also coordinate with the academic sector for further advancements. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program, established for unmanned maritime systems advancement, may coordinate with academic institutions for research, training, and commercialization opportunities. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program aims to advance unmanned maritime systems by providing training, facilitating commercialization through partnerships, arranging access to testing facilities, and engaging with academic institutions with relevant expertise. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program aims to advance unmanned maritime systems by increasing operational tolerance, certifying capacity, training operators, facilitating engagement with academic institutions, promoting information sharing, and coordinating with the private sector for commercialization. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assess their availability for Navy and NOAA missions. The Administrator will regularly assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use to support missions of the Administration. This includes science-based assessments of suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness, as well as evaluating operational utility. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for their suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications required by Administration programs. This includes evaluating operational reliability and consulting with various stakeholders to conduct assessments. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. They may develop agreements with the Secretary of the Navy for procurement efficiency. The Administrator may develop a memorandum of agreement with the Secretary of the Navy to enhance procurement efficiency for unmanned maritime systems. This Act does not alter Federal procurement law. Additionally, the Administrator is required to report on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for NOAA missions. SEC. 6. REPORTS ON UNMANNED MARITIME SYSTEMS AND USAGE FOR MISSION OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION. The Administrator must submit reports on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for NOAA missions every four years, including an inventory of current systems, data summaries, and benefits realized. Each report submitted under subsection (a) shall include an inventory of current unmanned maritime systems used by the Administration, data summaries, benefits realized, and a prioritized list of data requirements that could be met with unmanned maritime systems. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific Senate and House committees. SEC. 7. FUNDING AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES. The Administrator will use existing funds for this Act and may enter contracts with governments. The Administrator may enter contracts, agreements, and transactions with governments, accept donations and services, receive funds from other agencies, utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, transfer funds to organizations, and use resources with consent for the Act. The Administrator has the authority to accept funds, donations, and enter contracts with various entities, transfer appropriated funds, and utilize resources with consent for the Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
