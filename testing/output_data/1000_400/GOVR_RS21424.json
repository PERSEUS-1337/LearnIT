    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given flexibility by states to set emission limits, while new sources had to adhere to EPA-set standards to prevent new pollution problems. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act established strict technology-based standards for new sources of air pollutants that may endanger public health. These standards, known as NSPSs, are set by the EPA and require the use of the best demonstrated technology to achieve emission rates. Additionally, in areas with cleaner or dirtier air than national standards, proposed major new sources must undergo NSR before construction, requiring a pre-construction permit. The Clean Air Act requires new sources of air pollutants to meet strict technology-based standards known as NSPSs. Proposed major new sources in areas with cleaner or dirtier air must undergo NSR before construction, obtaining permits with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. The issue of RMRR arises because the CAA applies NSPSs and NSR not only to newly constructed stationary sources but also to modifications of existing sources. The Clean Air Act applies NSPSs and NSR to new sources and modifications of existing sources, defining a \"new source\" as any stationary source constructed or modified after the publication of relevant regulations. The definition of \"modification\" is crucial in determining the applicability of NSR and NSPSs, with the act requiring permits for major new sources or modifications in areas with cleaner or dirtier air. The Clean Air Act defines \"modification\" as any physical change in a stationary source that increases air pollutant emissions or results in the emission of new pollutants. This definition determines which changes trigger NSR and NSPSs, but leaves questions about specific terms like \"physical change\" unanswered. The Clean Air Act defines \"modification\" as any physical change in a stationary source that increases air pollutant emissions or results in the emission of new pollutants. This definition triggers NSR and NSPSs, with questions remaining about terms like \"physical change.\" EPA also considers a \"reconstruction\" as replacing components of a facility where the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50% of the cost to build a new facility, and it is feasible to meet NSPSs. EPA defines a \"reconstruction\" as replacing components of a facility where the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50% of the cost to build a new facility, and it is feasible to meet NSPSs. A change in a facility can constitute a reconstruction regardless of emission increases. EPA's definition of \"modification\" echoes the act's definition but includes exceptions for certain changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications. The EPA defines \"modification\" as changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications, including exceptions for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities. Eligibility for the exemption was determined through case-by-case analysis until recently. The EPA determined eligibility for the RMRR exemption through case-by-case analysis, weighing various factors. In the case of Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly (\"WEPCO\"), extensive renovation was proposed, triggering NSPS and PSD-area NSR requirements. Despite WEPCO's argument for RMRR, EPA dismissed it, and the Seventh Circuit upheld EPA's case-by-case approach. In WEPCO v. Reilly, EPA determined that the proposed renovation project was not eligible for the RMRR exemption due to its substantial and unprecedented nature, high cost, and infrequency. The Seventh Circuit upheld EPA's ruling, emphasizing the non-routineness of the project. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, particularly with CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities for plant changes. In recent years, the RMRR exemption has been a focal point, with CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities for plant changes that exceeded \"routine maintenance.\" President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group directed EPA to review the impact of NSR on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity, resulting in EPA's report in June 2002 advocating for specifying certain activities as \"routine maintenance.\" EPA's June 2002 report to the President advocated for specifying certain activities as \"routine maintenance.\" In December 2002, EPA published final regulations affecting how sources calculate emission increases under NSR rules. EPA also proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that qualify as RMRR without other considerations. The EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that qualify as RMRR without other considerations. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman involved the EPA determining that the TVA violated the CAA through rehabilitation projects at its coal-fired electric power plants that exceeded RMRR. The court found that the CAA was unconstitutional in allowing severe civil and criminal penalties to be imposed by a court. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA was unconstitutional in allowing penalties for noncompliance with EPA's ACOs without court adjudication. This decision did not address the RMRR exception itself, but EPA's final rule in October 2003 significantly reshaped the contours of RMRR. The October 2003 final rule reshaped the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. EPA's new approach addresses criticism of the old case-by-case method, aiming to support safe and efficient plant operation. The new rule reshaped the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. It addresses criticism of the old case-by-case method and specifies criteria for component replacement. The new rule specifies that replacing components of a process unit with identical or functional equivalents is considered RMRR if the cost is less than 20% of the unit's value, does not alter design parameters, and meets emission limitations. This approach allows for more replacements compared to the previous case-by-case method, with the latter still available as an alternative. The rule does not require recordkeeping. The new rule allows for more replacements of components in a process unit under specific conditions, reducing the need for the former case-by-case approach. It does not impose recordkeeping requirements and applies only to conduct after its effective date. The State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency involves multiple lawsuits challenging the equipment-replacement RMRR rule under the Clean Air Act. The court granted a stay on the rule pending full review, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success for the petitioners. On December 24, 2003, the court granted petitioners' motion to stay the rule pending full review, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success. The new rule was suspended, and the old case-by-case approach continues to apply. The court also declined to consolidate the actions with another group of cases challenging a previous rule but designated the same panel for both sets of cases."
