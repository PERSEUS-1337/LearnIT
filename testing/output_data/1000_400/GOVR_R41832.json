    "content": "Pakistan's stability and efforts to combat religious militancy are crucial to U.S. interests due to its involvement in various urgent policy areas such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite past cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Pakistan's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened in recent years. Pakistan's cooperation with U.S.-led counterterrorism efforts has been praised, but doubts about Islamabad's commitment to core U.S. interests have deepened. The country's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. Pakistan's troubled economy, political instability, and difficult relations with neighbors pose challenges for U.S. decision makers. Islamist radicalism has spread in the country, with its border region near Afghanistan becoming a haven for insurgents and jihadists. The Pakistani people have faced heavy losses due to Islamist radicalism and terrorism, with the country experiencing a high number of terrorist attacks. The government claims significant casualties and financial losses in the \"war on extremism.\" Islamabad's cooperation with the U.S. in counterterrorism efforts has been praised, but doubts remain about its commitment to core U.S. interests. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan in 2011 marked a new phase in U.S.-Pakistan relations. In 2011, Pakistan experienced over 26 terrorist attacks per week, ranking third after Afghanistan and Iraq in the number of incidents. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan led to increased scrutiny and strained relations with the U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen accused Pakistan of supporting Afghan insurgents attacking U.S. interests, causing significant frustration. NATO troops in Afghanistan also faced challenges in late November. In late November 2011, NATO troops in Afghanistan faced retaliation from Pakistani army outposts near the border, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. A Pentagon investigation blamed poor coordination and miscommunication, leading to Pakistan's fury and the scrapping of bilateral agreements with the U.S. regarding supply lines and covert activities in Afghanistan. Pakistan's government and people expressed fury at a suspected intentional strike by NATO troops. Pakistani officials scrapped and renegotiated bilateral agreements with the United States related to supply lines into Afghanistan. Islamabad demanded a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, leading to the closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies into Afghanistan. Despite anticipation of a deal to reopen them, the GLOCs remain closed to date. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies into Afghanistan remains unresolved, with negotiations stalled over a potential fee hike. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, causing confusion and anger among Americans. The Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to anger among Americans and a response from the Senate Appropriations Committee to dock $1 million from U.S. aid funding unless the doctor is freed. The cooperative aspects of bilateral relations have remained frozen in 2012. The Pakistani doctor received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to anger among Americans and a response from the Senate Appropriations Committee to dock $1 million from U.S. aid funding unless the doctor is freed. Bilateral relations have remained frozen in 2012, with anti-American sentiments and xenophobic conspiracy theories prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis. The United States is now viewed less favorably than India by Pakistanis, while Americans have increasingly negative views of Pakistan. Travel to Pakistan is considered high-risk, with American diplomats facing travel restrictions and civilians being abducted. Pakistanis now view the United States less favorably than India, while Americans have increasingly negative views of Pakistan. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American diplomats facing restrictions and civilians being abducted, including the execution of Daniel Pearl. Islamist extremism in Pakistan is a major concern for U.S. foreign policy, hindering progress on key goals such as defeating terrorist groups and resolving the Pakistan-India rivalry. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for terrorism by Pakistan-based groups have intensified. Increasing concerns about American citizens being recruited for terrorism by Pakistan-based groups have intensified. Key U.S. goals, including defeating Al Qaeda and stabilizing Afghanistan, are at risk due to the presence of wanted enemies like Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in Pakistan. Some in Congress are questioning the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan and calling for a reduction in foreign aid. Some American intelligence officials suspect Zawahiri may be protected by elements of the Pakistani government. Congress is increasingly questioning the effectiveness of U.S. policy towards Pakistan and considering reducing foreign aid. Legislation to restrict aid and military reimbursements is being discussed in Congress. Pakistan received about $2 billion in direct aid in FY2012, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. warns that strict aid conditions could harm cooperation and trust. Pakistan received $2 billion in direct aid in FY2012, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan has not been as catastrophic as expected. By keeping the routes closed, Islamabad has \"played its trump card\" in relations with Washington. Pakistan risks isolation diplomatically and may need to work positively with the U.S. and NATO to change course. The civilian government's negotiating strategy could result in the country losing billions. Pakistan has played its trump card in relations with Washington but risks isolation diplomatically. Working positively with the United States and NATO may be the only way to change this course. The civilian government's negotiating strategy could result in the country losing billions in foreign assistance and its ability to influence post-war Afghanistan. President Obama has urged Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a peaceful future for the region and to neutralize terrorist safe havens. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has acknowledged Pakistan's ties to anti-Afghan and anti-India terrorist groups. The United States will continue to press Pakistan to expand its role in securing a peaceful future for the region and neutralize terrorist safe havens. Despite acknowledging Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups, the US insists on maintaining a relationship with Pakistan. Some analysts suggest a more confrontational approach towards Islamabad, but continued engagement with Pakistan is seen as the most realistic option. As part of its strategy for stabilizing Afghanistan, the US has increased nonmilitary aid to improve the lives of the Pakistani people. The United States continues to engage with Pakistan as the most realistic option, despite some advocating for a confrontational approach. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to improve Pakistani lives and conditions military aid on progress in combating militancy and promoting democratic institutions. However, in 2011, the US suspended $800 million in security assistance and is evaluating Pakistan's cooperation more rigorously before releasing further aid. Additionally, $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements remains undisbursed due to disagreements. The US has suspended up to $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan and is evaluating cooperation more rigorously before releasing further aid. $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Analysts suggest supporting Pakistan's civilian authorities to address the country's foreign policy behavior influenced by the military's strategic interests. Pakistan's foreign policy behavior is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading to tolerance of safe havens for militant groups. Analysts recommend strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian government to reduce conflict and achieve common goals. However, Pakistan's civilian leaders have shown little willingness to address the outcomes of their security policies. Pakistan's civilian leaders have not shown willingness to address the outcomes of their security policies, blaming the United States for increased extremism. This perspective overlooks Pakistan's historical support for Islamist militancy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan during his time in office. The Pakistani public widely supports Islamist militancy, with official Pakistani involvement in aiding Afghanistan's Taliban regime. President Obama's decision to visit India without stopping in Pakistan raised concerns of a pro-India bias in US policy, causing anxiety among Pakistani officials. Pakistani leaders view US-India relations suspiciously, feeling threatened by perceived favoritism towards India. The Administration's India policies, including U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation and sympathy towards New Delhi's perspective on regional terrorism, are seen as threatening by Pakistani leaders and citizens. Pakistan feels increasingly encircled by India and external forces, especially after Afghanistan's closer ties with India and the U.S. The tumultuous events of 2011 may signal the end of the \"post-9/11 period\" in bilateral relations. Pakistan's security institutions fear external forces are encircling the country, leading to a shift towards a more narrow, transactional relationship with the U.S. in 2012 and beyond. The end of the \"post-9/11 period\" in bilateral relations is marked by a desire for a formal, business-like engagement with agreed-upon limits. In 2012, Pakistan sought a formal, business-like relationship with the U.S., with agreed-upon limits. This shift was influenced by concerns of encirclement and a desire for a more transactional approach. New restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan were being considered in FY2013. Ambassador Sherry Rehman was appointed as Pakistan's envoy to the U.S. in late November 2011. Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's envoy to the United States, outlined prerequisites for improving the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on trade over aid. Former U.S. diplomats suggest a more normal but constructive relationship to address mutual concerns. Former U.S. diplomats advise forging a more normal, constructive relationship with Pakistan by reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid programs, fostering business ties, and supporting initiatives for regional stability. Optimism is found in the reduced domestic status of the Pakistani military. The text suggests promoting regional stability in South Asia, including improving Pakistan-India relations and considering the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. It emphasizes the need for the Obama Administration to avoid a purely security-oriented approach in Pakistan to prevent stronger anti-American sentiment and restore credibility to the military. The text highlights the risk of strengthening anti-American nationalism in Pakistan and restoring credibility to the military. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's intransigence on GLOCs and insistence on an apology for Salala in May 2012, urging the U.S. to pressure Islamabad on counterterrorism. There are calls for a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan, citing a shift from engagement policies as a potential mistake. Some analysts advocate for a more adversarial stance towards Pakistan, suggesting targeted sanctions and a reduction in military aid. Others go as far as considering Pakistan an enemy in the context of Afghanistan policy, arguing that openly acknowledging disagreements would benefit both countries. Some analysts suggest targeting individuals for sanctions and cutting military aid to Pakistan. Others argue for considering Pakistan an enemy in Afghanistan policy, believing that openly admitting disagreements would be beneficial. Another viewpoint proposes credible threats to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands to ensure genuine cooperation. However, some reject a more adversarial approach as counterproductive and risky for the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan. A Washington-based Pakistani analyst rejects a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, advocating for security assurances and targeted efforts to bolster civilian governance instead. The observer questions whether Pakistan's current economic rapprochement with India is a tactical move or a strategic shift by the Pakistani military. Security assurances and targeted efforts to bolster Pakistan's civilian governance institutions are recommended. The Pakistani military's current approach towards India is questioned, whether it is tactical or a strategic shift. The changing geopolitical landscape in South and Central Asia suggests Pakistan should focus on energy and trade cooperation with neighbors rather than traditional conflicts with India and Afghanistan. The changing geopolitical landscape in South and Central Asia suggests Pakistan should prioritize energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over traditional conflicts with India and Afghanistan. The country's security services and domestic public's worldview hinder civilian leaders from pursuing such policies. The assassination of Punjab province's governor, Salman Taseer, a liberal politician, highlights the challenges faced in moving towards a more secure and cooperative future. On January 4, 2011, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was assassinated by his own security team due to his vocal criticisms of blasphemy laws. His killer, Malik Mumtaz Qadri, was praised by some in Pakistani society. Taseer's assassination was a setback for liberal forces in Pakistan. The assassination of Governor Taseer, a blow to liberal forces in Pakistan, was supported by the Barelvi Muslim sect. Minister Bhatti, a Christian advocating for religious tolerance, was also assassinated. Secretary Clinton condemned both killings as attacks on values of tolerance and respect. President Zardari and Prime Minister Gilani responded to the assassinations. Clinton expressed shock and outrage at Bhatti's killing, calling it an attack on values of tolerance championed by Pakistan's founding father. President Zardari addressed the assassinations in an op-ed, highlighting a growing threat of Islamist radicalism in Pakistan. The Taseer and Bhatti assassinations were seen as evidence of this trend. On January 27, 2011, Raymond Davis, an American CIA contractor, shot and killed two men in Lahore, Pakistan, claiming self-defense during a robbery attempt. Pakistani authorities accused him of murder, sparking a diplomatic controversy over his legal status and potential impact on U.S. assistance to Pakistan. Obama described Davis as \"our diplomat.\" The U.S. government later admitted he was a CIA contractor tracking militant groups in Pakistan. Controversy over his legal status led to threats of reduced U.S. assistance. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease tensions. The CIA negotiated with the ISI for Davis's release, eventually securing it with a $2.3 million diyat payment. In late February, the CIA negotiated with the ISI for Davis's release, eventually securing it with a $2.3 million diyat payment. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism and leading to calls to reduce U.S. aid. There were questions about Pakistan's role in sheltering bin Laden, with concerns about a support system for him in the country. The news of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts in Pakistan raised questions about the country's role and potential complicity in sheltering him. President Obama's advisor stated it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have a support system in Pakistan. This led to doubts about Pakistan's credibility and its military and intelligence services' effectiveness in combating extremism. Pakistan faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid that resulted in bin Laden's death. Pakistan's credibility suffered a blow after failing to detect Osama bin Laden in their country. The military and intelligence services faced criticism for incompetence. Army Chief Gen. Kayani warned against future incursions, leading to anti-American sentiments and threats to NATO supply lines. Bilateral distrust and acrimony increased. Pakistan issued a strong condemnation of the U.S. raid, threatened to close vital land lines of communication, and faced public demonstrations with an anti-American tone. Bilateral distrust and acrimony increased, leading to questioning of continued engagement with Pakistan. Senior Members called for more oversight and accountability for future U.S. assistance. Both major parties expressed disbelief at Pakistan's allegations and called for greater oversight of U.S. assistance. House Speaker emphasized the need for more engagement with Pakistan. Despite distrust, the U.S. continued to engage with Pakistan post-Abbottabad raid. No conclusive evidence showed official Pakistan's awareness of bin Laden's whereabouts. In the weeks following the Abbottabad raid, U.S. officials maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan despite questions about OBL's refuge. There was no conclusive evidence of official Pakistan's awareness of bin Laden's whereabouts. Privately, senior Administration officials were divided on the future of the bilateral relationship, with some advocating strong reprisals for perceived Pakistani intransigence. On May 22, 2011, militants attacked Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station near Karachi, resulting in casualties and destruction of U.S.-supplied equipment. Heavily armed militants stormed Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station near Karachi, resulting in casualties and destruction of U.S.-supplied aircraft. The attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban as revenge for bin Laden's killing, raised concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. The attack on Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station by heavily armed militants raised concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. The Pakistani military faced criticism for the breach, leading to the arrest of a former navy commando and court-martial of three navy officers for negligence. Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was accused of ordering the torture and murder of investigative journalist Syed Saleem. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence in connection with the attack on Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who had written about Al Qaeda cells in the Pakistan Navy. The ISI denied involvement, and a closed government inquiry began in June. The ISI was accused of ordering the attack on journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who had criticized the Pakistani establishment. U.S. officials claimed senior ISI officials directed the attack to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. An official Commission of Inquiry in 2012 was unable to identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder. In January 2012, a Commission of Inquiry reported to the Pakistani government that it couldn't identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder. Recommendations were made to make intelligence agencies more law-abiding and accountable through various mechanisms. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and other obstacles. In 2011, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and delays in visa processing. This move was seen as a warning to Islamabad about the consequences of lack of cooperation. Pakistani military dismissed the impact on their combat operations. In 2011, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in assistance to Pakistan, seen as a warning for lack of cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact on their operations, suggesting U.S. aid be redirected to development projects. Observers believed the decision could lead to more resentment than cooperation from Pakistani leaders and validate the view of the U.S. as an unreliable ally. In October 2011, Mansoor Ijaz wrote an op-ed referencing a memorandum allegedly given to him after bin Laden's death. In October 2011, a Pakistani-American businessman wrote an op-ed referencing a memorandum allegedly given to him after bin Laden's death, requesting U.S. assistance to avert a military coup and install friendly leaders for cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. The Pakistani Supreme Court launched an investigation to uncover the author and purpose of the document. In October 2011, a Pakistani-American businessman revealed a memo requesting U.S. support to prevent a military coup in Pakistan and install cooperative leaders for counterterrorism efforts. The resulting \"Memogate\" scandal implicated Ambassador Haqqani and President Zardari, but the investigation lacked credible evidence of wrongdoing. Despite concerns of civil-military clashes, Haqqani was allowed to leave Pakistan, and the threat of Zardari's overthrow by the military loomed. The investigation into the \"Memogate\" scandal involving Ambassador Haqqani and President Zardari fizzled out due to a lack of credible evidence. Concerns of civil-military clashes arose, with rumors of a potential military coup in December. Despite this, the army publicly pledged to support democracy, with Gen. Kayani dismissing the rumors as speculation. The military in Pakistan is warned against conspiracies to overthrow the elected government, emphasizing its accountability to parliament. Despite rumors of a coup in December, the army pledged support for democracy. The civilian government was angered by the army and intelligence chiefs bypassing them in court engagements, calling it unconstitutional. Public sentiment shows reluctance towards military rule, with opposition politicians not seeking military intervention. The judiciary, media, and public play active roles in the political landscape. The Pakistani public is averse to military rule, with opposition politicians not seeking military help. The judiciary, media, and public are active in politics. In January, Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy and urged the army and Supreme Court to stay within constitutional limits. The crisis atmosphere faded after Prime Minister Gilani softened his criticisms of the military. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border faced heavy fire from hilltop positions inside Pakistan. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border were attacked by hilltop positions inside Pakistan. Despite Pakistani liaison officers informing American counterparts of Pakistani soldiers coming under fire, 24 soldiers were killed before the air assault ended. In November 2011, U.S. forces were attacked near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Despite Pakistani officers warning of soldiers under fire, 24 were killed before air support was called in. Pakistanis accused NATO of intentional killings, leading to anger and closure of supply routes. The Pakistani government's anger over the NATO attack in November 2011 led to the closure of supply routes and eviction of U.S. personnel. Islamabad demands a formal apology from Washington, rejecting U.S. expressions of regret. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense. The Pentagon's investigation into the NATO attack in November 2011 concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, despite serious miscommunication and poor coordination. Pakistan demanded a formal and unconditional apology from Washington, rejecting U.S. expressions of regret. Pakistan's military criticized the NATO investigators for unjustly assigning partial responsibility to Pakistan. The Pentagon's investigation into the NATO attack in November 2011 concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense. Pakistan's military criticized NATO for assigning partial responsibility to Pakistan, calling it unjustified. A document released in January 2012 detailed Pakistan's perspective, acknowledging Pakistani forces fired first but claiming it was legitimate. Pakistan blamed the incident on the failure of US/ISAF to share information and suggested the attack was deliberate. Press reports indicated the Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the NATO attack near the border with Pakistan, but the plan was aborted after other incidents. Advocates believed an apology would mend relations, while opponents feared it would show weakness. Pentagon figures were against apologizing, viewing it as an admission of fault. Later, coordinated insurgent attacks in Afghanistan blamed on the Haqqani Network strained relations further. In late February, Secretary Clinton was set to apologize to Foreign Minister Khar in London, but the plan was aborted after U.S. military personnel burned Korans in Afghanistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations were further strained when the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee held a hearing on Baluchistan, with calls for the partition of Pakistan into substates. Investigations held a hearing on Baluchistan, a Pakistani province with a violent separatist conflict. A witness called for Pakistan's partition into substates, including Baluchistan. Congressman Rohrabacher introduced a resolution supporting Baluchistan's right to self-determination, angering the Islamabad government and sparking criticism. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, stating no policy to support Baluchistan's independence. The Salala incident led to a freeze in relations between Islamabad and Washington, with Prime Minister Gilani denouncing it as an attack on Pakistani sovereignty. The Obama Administration clarified that it does not support Baluchistan's independence. A review process by the Islamabad government, completed in April 2012, was seen as a rare display of assertiveness by some, while others viewed it as a facade for military influence. The review process by the Islamabad government in early 2012 resulted in the issuance of the \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" in April. Key demands included the immediate cessation of U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and prohibiting the use of Pakistani airspace for transporting arms to Afghanistan. The Islamabad government demanded the cessation of U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and prohibiting the use of Pakistani airspace for transporting arms to Afghanistan. They also called for an unconditional apology from the United States for a NATO/ISAF attack, justice for those responsible for the Salala incident, and the discontinuation of any agreements related to national security. Additionally, they prohibited overt or covert operations, private security contractors, and intelligence operatives inside Pakistan. The Islamabad government demanded justice for the Salala incident and the cessation of U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan. They also called for an end to agreements related to national security, prohibited covert operations, private security contractors, and intelligence operatives in Pakistan. Additionally, they requested that the United States offer a civil nuclear deal similar to the one given to India in 2005. The Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani sovereignty despite ongoing drone strikes. The Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani sovereignty despite ongoing drone strikes. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Marc Grossman, visited Islamabad for high-level talks but left without any breakthrough on Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes. Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes, including \"signature strikes\" targeting suspected militants, remain a major point of contention in the bilateral relationship with the US. The CIA's reluctance to give up the ability to strike \"high-value targets\" is a key issue. Reports suggest that Pakistan may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines until drone strikes are stopped. The demand for an unconditional apology for inadvertent civilian deaths is also a sticking point. Some reports suggest that Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines to Afghanistan via Karachi port until drone strikes are ended. Pakistan also demands an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. The U.S. government is withholding military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding pending an agreement on bilateral reengagement. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on decisions about the alliance's future. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations regarding counterterrorism funding. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on decisions about the alliance's future engagement in Afghanistan, with President Zardari attending after a personal call from the NATO Secretary-General. President Obama's refusal to meet during the session highlighted U.S.-Pakistan tensions and the unresolved GLOCs issue. President Zardari attended the NATO summit in Chicago after a personal call from the NATO Secretary-General. However, President Obama refused to meet with him, causing tensions and highlighting the unresolved GLOCs issue. Some in Pakistan viewed Zardari's participation as embarrassing, but Foreign Minister Khar remained positive, emphasizing Pakistan's vital role in the summit. President Zardari's participation in the NATO summit in Chicago caused tensions as President Obama refused to meet him, leading to embarrassment for some in Pakistan.

In a separate development, Shakil Afridi was convicted of treason and sentenced to 33 years in prison for his involvement with the CIA in collecting DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. Shakil Afridi was convicted of treason and sentenced to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with officials calling it \"shocking and outrageous\" and stating that Afridi should be praised, not punished. The sentence given to Shakil Afridi for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound was deemed \"shocking and outrageous\" by officials. The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized the punishment, stating that Afridi should be praised, not punished. Islamabad maintains that the process was in accordance with Pakistani law, but concerns have been raised about the conviction process. Commentators are questioning the conviction of Shakil Afridi, particularly because he was convicted without legal representation in a court outside the original jurisdiction. The Administration's assessment of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy in March 2011 noted some progress in combating Al Qaeda but highlighted a lack of progress in executing counterinsurgency efforts in certain regions. The last quarter of 2010 showed no progress in effectively executing counterinsurgency efforts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. There was a lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning to complement clearing operations, hindering the path towards defeating the insurgency in Pakistan. Secretary Clinton's certification in March 2011 allowed the release of security-related aid to Pakistan, confirming Islamabad's efforts in combating terrorism. In March 2011, Secretary Clinton certified Pakistan's efforts in combating terrorist groups, allowing the release of security-related aid. However, skepticism arose due to concerns about Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani Network and the presence of terrorist bases in the country. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton defended her certification of Pakistan's efforts in combating terrorist groups, citing legal requirements and political considerations. No similar certification was issued for FY2012, with little positive news beyond successes against Al Qaeda reported in the Administration's September 2011 assessment. The Administration's September 2011 assessment on Pakistan showed little positive news beyond successes against Al Qaeda. Indicators for civilian control, COIN capabilities, and international community involvement remained static or declined, attributed to decreased bilateral security cooperation. Indicators and metrics declined in the first quarter of 2011 due to decreased bilateral security cooperation with Pakistan. International efforts to stabilize Pakistan saw limited progress, with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement on hold since August 2010. The Pentagon's report noted positive trends in Afghanistan but highlighted the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan as the most critical threat. The Pentagon's recent report to Congress on Afghanistan highlighted the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan as the most critical threat to security and stability in the region. Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations and provision of safe havens continue to undermine efforts in Afghanistan. Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations, provision of safe havens, and unwillingness to interdict material from Afghanistan undermine security and threaten ISAF's campaign. US-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for US diplomats in Pakistan. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have been strained by issues such as U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. High-level interactions, especially among military and intelligence officials, have continued, with a notable lapse in late 2011/early 2012. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad to address the existence of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. During a delegation to Islamabad, Secretary Clinton, along with other senior officials, emphasized to Pakistani leaders that the U.S. will not tolerate militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, but engagement continues at other levels. Secretary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in February 2012 to convey U.S. respect for Pakistan's Parliament's review of bilateral relations. In February 2012, Secretary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in London to discuss U.S. eagerness to resume engagement with Pakistan, particularly on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Amb. Grossman later emphasized the U.S. commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan during a meeting with President Zardari in Tajikistan. President Obama also met with Prime Minister Gilani at a nuclear security summit. In March, Amb. Grossman met with President Zardari in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, emphasizing the desire for a constructive relationship with Pakistan. President Obama also met with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul, South Korea, reaffirming the importance of shared interests like counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan. Senior U.S. and Pakistani military commanders held talks, discussing border issues. In April, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar in Islamabad to build upon previous conversations and achieve a balanced approach respecting Pakistan's sovereignty. USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah also visited Pakistan to express strong commitment to improving ties through civilian assistance and development support. In late April, Amb. Grossman visited Islamabad for the 6th Trilateral Core Group meeting between the United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Despite no breakthroughs on major points of disagreement, Grossman focused on reopening GLOCs while Jilani reiterated Pakistan's opposition to drone strikes. Washington's refusal to apologize for the Salala incident ultimately hindered progress. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi in mid-May. Missile strikes in Pakistan by American UAVs have been controversial but effective against militants. President Obama personally approves the covert program overseen by the CIA. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi in mid-May. American Predator and Reaper UAVs launch missile strikes in Pakistan, overseen by the CIA and approved by President Obama. The strikes have been effective against militants but criticized for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty. The drone strikes in western Pakistan have targeted Al Qaeda and other Islamist militants, criticized for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty. Despite official protests, Pakistan is believed to tacitly allow the strikes and provide intelligence for them. Most observers believe Pakistan has allowed drone strikes despite official protests. Some analysts see the strikes as necessary and effective against Al Qaeda. The strikes are part of a messaging tactic, with major strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and the suspension of U.S. military aid to Islamabad. The CIA's drone strikes in Pakistan are seen as part of a messaging tactic, with major strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and the suspension of U.S. military aid to Islamabad. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes, with some urging for a reduction in pace to avoid further straining relations with Pakistan. Despite concerns, a mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA campaign. The mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, with changes implemented to reduce \"signature strikes\" and involve the State Department in strike decisions. The review aimed to address concerns about the program's impact on relations with Pakistan and minimize collateral damage, with claims of exceptional precision in targeting militants. The changes in the United States drone program have reduced \"signature strikes\" against suspected militants. President Obama defended the program, claiming minimal civilian casualties, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating hundreds of civilian deaths. Despite killing militants, violence in western Pakistan has not decreased significantly. Independent analysts dispute the U.S. government's claims of minimal civilian casualties in drone strikes in western Pakistan, estimating that 145-535 civilians, including children, have been killed. Despite targeting militants and their commanders, violence in the region has not subsided. The U.S. may continue using this tactic due to the upcoming NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Relations with Pakistan's ISI have been strained since the 1980s, with doubts about their activities intensifying in 2008. The ISI, established in the 1980s, has a history of cooperation and mistrust with American intelligence. Concerns about the agency's use of militant proxies, involvement in abductions, and manipulation of politics have raised international alarm. The ISI is under direct army control, with the Director-General seen as second to the Chief of Army Staff. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam took over as DG-ISI in 2012, following Lt. Gen. Pasha. Islam, who received military training in the U.S., previously commanded the army's V Corp in Karachi. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, the Director-General of the ISI, is considered the deputy to the Chief of Army Staff. He replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha in 2012 and is seen as a potential candidate for the COAS position. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents. There are concerns that ISI sanctuaries in Pakistan enable Afghan militants to sustain their insurgency. The ISI in Pakistan is accused of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, including increasing direct contacts with the Taliban and supplying them with explosives. A leaked NATO report suggests that Afghan insurgents continue to receive support from the ISI, with senior Taliban leaders regularly meeting with ISI personnel for strategic advice. The leaked NATO report in January 2012 revealed that Afghan insurgents receive direct support from the ISI, with senior Taliban leaders meeting regularly with ISI personnel for strategic advice. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton stated that elements of the Pakistani government are ambivalent about cracking down on terrorism. The ISI is connected to anti-India terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton mentioned Pakistani government elements being ambivalent about fighting terrorism. There are concerns about Pakistani security services being infiltrated by Islamist extremists. Pakistani officials deny ISI cooperation with militants, but leaked cables suggest bias against the US in military training. Pakistan's security services, including the ISI, are suspected of having ties to Islamist extremists. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables suggest bias against the United States in military training. The ISI is seen as divided between nationalist and Islamist factions, with tensions in CIA-ISI relations. The ISI is divided between nationalist and Islamist factions, with tensions in CIA-ISI relations. The Raymond Davis episode strained relations further, leading to increased scrutiny of U.S. security officials in Pakistan and suspicions of ISI links to Islamist extremism after OBL's death. Pakistan cracked down on its citizens with alleged ties to extremism following the May 2011 raid. Following the May 2011 raid that led to Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan increased pressure on its citizens working with the CIA. Access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody was granted after the raid. A Pakistani newspaper revealed the purported name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, marking the second time in six months that the top American operative in Pakistan had been exposed. U.S. officials believed these disclosures were intentional to showcase the ISI's power and influence. The Pakistani newspaper revealed the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief for the second time in six months, believed to be deliberate by U.S. officials to show ISI's power. U.S. evidence of collusion between Pakistani officials and Afghan insurgents included instances where the CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in FATA, only to find them abandoned when Pakistani army units arrived. The CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in Pakistan's FATA, but Pakistani army units found them abandoned, leading to accusations of tipping off. Despite discord, joint intelligence work continued, with a Yemeni Al Qaeda operative arrested in Karachi shortly after the OBL raid. In a good-faith effort to mend relations with Washington, Pakistan arrested a key Al Qaeda operative in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence. Additionally, Pakistan pledged to grant more visas to CIA officers and reported the death of a top Al Qaeda leader in a drone strike. In June, Pakistan pledged to grant visas to CIA officers and reported the deaths of key Al Qaeda leaders in drone strikes. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting militants in the FATA region has continued despite worsening government relations. The CIA has been assisting in targeting senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta, Pakistan, despite worsening government relations. Reports suggest a multibillion dollar effort to establish a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth through friendly relations with Afghanistan. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth through friendly relations with Afghanistan, supporting Afghan mujahideen and the Taliban regime. The porous border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, divided by the Durand Line, has led to ongoing acrimony between the two countries. This discord is detrimental to U.S. interests as both Pakistan and Afghanistan are key allies in combating Islamic militancy. The ongoing acrimony between Pakistan and Afghanistan is detrimental to U.S. interests. Both countries play central roles as U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but their goals in Afghanistan are not fully compatible. Pakistan seeks a post-NATO Afghanistan that is deferential to Islamabad, while the U.S.-led coalition aims for a capable and independent Afghanistan. This difference in objectives could lead to increased cooperation between Kabul and India. Pakistan aims for a post-NATO Afghanistan dependent on Islamabad, while the U.S. wants an independent Afghanistan. Tensions arise as Pakistan may use proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network. Washington seeks Islamabad's support for Afghan reconciliation talks, but differences in approaches are evident. Pakistan's reliance on Islamabad in shaping the reconciliation process could increase its leverage. Washington seeks Islamabad's support for Afghan talks, but differences in approaches are evident. Pakistani officials are confused by U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Some argue that Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving their security services in peace negotiations with insurgent forces they have supported. Some argue that Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving their security services in peace negotiations with insurgent forces they have supported. Islamabad's relations with Kabul remain troubled, with Afghan insurgents finding safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi, hindering long-term stability in Afghanistan. U.S. military commanders see these havens as central obstacles to reconciliation. Pakistani cooperation is crucial for stability in Afghanistan, with Afghan insurgents using safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi. Declassified documents show that Taliban resurgence in the mid-2000s was linked to sanctuaries in western Pakistan. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Afghan officials still accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Afghan wariness of Pakistani influence remains strong. Despite some warming of Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Afghan officials openly accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism inside Afghanistan. Afghan wariness of Pakistani influence persists, with analysts cynical of Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" to exert dominance over Afghan neighbors. Islamabad is concerned about potential U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and fears being abandoned by the international community, as seen in the 1990s. President Obama's announcement of a drawdown in 2011 signals a focus on an exit strategy. Pakistani leaders are concerned about potential U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and fear being abandoned by the international community. President Obama's announcement of a drawdown in 2011 signals a focus on an exit strategy, raising doubts about long-term commitment to stabilizing the region. Pakistani leaders insist that Afghan stability is a vital interest and have made efforts to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission to accelerate the peace process. Chief Kayani, ISI Director Pasha, and Gilani traveled to Kabul to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission and accelerate the peace process. Gilani aimed to shift Kabul's allegiance from the U.S. to Islamabad and China, criticizing America's \"imperial designs.\" The new Joint Commission in June 2011 emphasized an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" peace process, leading to the \"Islamabad Declaration\" for improved ties. However, increased \"reverse infiltration\" in the summer of 2011 caused friction. In June 2011, the new Joint Commission emphasized an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" peace process, leading to the \"Islamabad Declaration\" for improved ties. However, increased \"reverse infiltration\" in the summer of 2011 caused friction between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan accused of firing rockets into Afghan provinces, killing 60 people. Relations strained after assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman. Afghan officials suspect ISI involvement. Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani was assassinated in Kabul by a suicide bomber, with Afghan officials suspecting ISI involvement. Pakistani officials denied any role in the assassination, but tensions between the two countries remain high. Afghan intelligence also claimed to have thwarted a plot to assassinate Karzai, with alleged culprits based in FATA and linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network. Pakistan supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, emphasizing that Kabul should lead the process. Pakistan strongly supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, believing Kabul should lead the process. Islamabad aims to deny India influence in post-conflict Afghanistan and controls which Taliban figures can negotiate. In 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a key Taliban commander, was captured in a joint ISI-CIA operation in Karachi, possibly orchestrated to facilitate talks with \"willing\" Taliban commanders for reconciliation negotiations. In early 2010, the Afghan Taliban's top military commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was captured in a joint ISI-CIA operation in Karachi. Pakistani elements may have orchestrated the arrest to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders for reconciliation negotiations. Pakistan launched an effort to broker reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network, sparking concerns about Islamabad's motives. Later that year, NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and senior Afghan officials in Kabul. In 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Afghan Taliban's top military commander, was captured in Karachi. This led to concerns about Islamabad's motives in brokering reconciliation talks between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and senior Afghan officials in Kabul, indicating Islamabad's influence over top Afghan insurgents. Pakistan was hesitant to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks, as suggested by the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan. In fall 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan indicated Islamabad's influence over top Afghan insurgents, with Pakistan hesitant to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks. Afghan President Karzai also complained that insurgent leaders in Pakistan were not independent enough to negotiate. By early 2012, Islamabad seemed to be allowing U.S.-Taliban negotiations. In April, Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to push the Taliban for talks, which Foreign Minister Khar called unrealistic. In April, Afghan President Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to prod the Taliban into negotiations. Prime Minister Gilani then issued an appeal for national reconciliation and peace. The Obama Administration welcomed the message, despite concerns about Pakistan's ties to Afghan insurgent groups. Observers fear that U.S. transition planning for Afghanistan is a cover for a hasty exit strategy. The Haqqani Network, based in the FATA region, is considered the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group by many experts. They pose a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests, maintaining close ties with al-Qaeda. The Haqqani Network is seen as a significant threat to Afghan stability and U.S. security interests due to their close ties with al-Qaeda. Experts believe military action is necessary to address the group, but Pakistan has been hesitant to act, possibly due to their historical relationship with the Haqqanis. The U.S. requests Pakistani military action against the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, citing their close ties with Jalaluddin Haqqani. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on the Intercontinental Hotel and the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul. In June 2011, Haqqani gunmen attacked Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel, leaving 18 dead. In September, a truck bomb by Haqqani fighters injured 77 American troops. A well-planned attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on September 13, 2011, changed U.S.-Pakistan relations, leaving 16 Afghans dead. This attack challenged the narrative of Afghanistan's security. Admiral Mullen urged Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases after the assault. The attack in Kabul's most protected area was seen as a blow to Afghanistan's security narrative. Admiral Mullen urged Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions with accusations of ISI involvement in a \"proxy war.\" Secretary Panetta issued an ultimatum to Pakistan to protect US forces from future Haqqani attacks. Mullen's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee was the strongest yet. Secretary Panetta issued an ultimatum to Pakistan to protect US forces from future Haqqani attacks, while Admiral Mullen accused the Haqqani network of being supported by Pakistan's ISI during his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Operatives planned and conducted the September 13 truck bomb attack and assault on the embassy. Credible evidence links them to the June 28 attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue. The statements from top military officials signal increased U.S. intolerance for Pakistan's double-game. President Obama acknowledged unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but urged Pakistan to take action. The Obama Administration did not fully align with Admiral Mullen's charges of Pakistan's double-game. President Obama acknowledged unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but urged Pakistan to take action. Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis hardened after the Wardak truck bombing. Haqqani fighters were implicated in further attacks on coalition targets in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies responsibility for the violence and rejects claims of supporting the Haqqanis. The Pakistani military criticized Mullen's statements as unfounded. Pakistani officials deny supporting Haqqanis and reject responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan. They criticize Mullen's unfounded statements and warn of damaging the bilateral relationship with the US. President Zardari emphasizes the need to avoid verbal assaults against Pakistan. Efforts to reconcile Haqqanis with the Kabul government have been hindered by their links to Al Qaeda. Zardari responds to verbal assaults, Pakistan seeks to facilitate Haqqani-Kabul government reconciliation despite Haqqani links to Al Qaeda. Pakistani military claims ability to bring Haqqanis to negotiations to avoid conflict. Unnamed Pakistani military officials claim they can deliver the Haqqanis to negotiations to avoid conflict. The Obama Administration considers designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Seven Haqqani leaders are already under U.S. sanctions. The Haqqani Network is being considered for designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators. Seven Haqqani leaders are already under U.S. sanctions, and there have been negotiations with the Haqqani leadership in the past. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not progressed in the House committee. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not progressed in the House committee. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer that is also used as a precursor for chemical explosives in Afghanistan. The majority of improvised explosive devices used by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan contain AN, which is believed to be smuggled from Pakistan since the Kabul government banned it in 2010. The use of ammonium nitrate (AN) as a chemical explosives precursor in Afghanistan has led to a significant increase in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used by Islamist insurgents. Despite a ban on AN in Afghanistan since 2010, most illicit AN is believed to come from neighboring Pakistan. The Pentagon reported a peak in total IED events in Afghanistan in the summer of 2011, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. Legislation in 2012 required a coordinated strategy to counter IED-related networks in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to ammonium nitrate (AN) in Afghanistan or enhance law enforcement and border security efforts to prevent its movement. Washington's efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives to counter IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Security agencies are urged to prevent the movement of ammonium nitrate into Afghanistan through diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology efforts. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation targeting the trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. The program, supported by various international organizations, has seen some successes. The illicit cross-border diversion and trafficking of 11 chemical explosives precursors, including AN, is being monitored through a collaborative effort involving the World Customs Organization, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol. Experts recommend adding urea fertilizer granules to AN to make processing for explosives more complicated. Other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags to track AN shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict AN and other precursors, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities to combat illicit trafficking, while NATO uses ground and air lines of communication. The Islamabad government has established a National Counter-IED Forum for Pakistani agencies to develop an action plan. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities for combating illicit trafficking, while NATO uses ground and air lines of communication through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan. These routes have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's anger over incidents and attacks on supply lines. In response to attacks on supply lines, truck drivers in Pakistan face dangers and corruption, with routes from Karachi to Afghanistan regularly targeted by insurgents. Thousands of trucks have been destroyed, drivers killed, and cargo stolen, leading to increased reliance on bribes to officials. Truck drivers in Pakistan face dangers and corruption on routes to Afghanistan, with trucks destroyed, drivers killed, and cargo stolen. The U.S. military began testing alternative routes like the Northern Distribution Network to reduce reliance on Pakistan. The Northern Distribution Network (NDN) handles nonlethal cargo for NATO, while the U.S. prefers Pakistan for faster logistics despite higher costs. Loss of Pakistani routes has not significantly impacted Afghan operations, with some officials stating they are managing well without them. However, the Pentagon views the continued closure of Pakistani routes as a strategic concern. The Pentagon considers the closure of Pakistani routes a strategic concern, as it has caused a backlog of equipment for Afghan security forces. NATO will need to remove a significant amount of equipment from Afghanistan, and U.S. commanders are pushing for the reopening of Pakistani routes as the fighting season approaches in 2012. NATO needs to remove a large amount of equipment from Afghanistan, worth billions of dollars, as the closure of Pakistani routes has caused a backlog. U.S. commanders are urging for the reopening of these routes before the spring fighting season in 2012. Pakistani officials have agreed \"in principle\" to reopen the routes, with indications that a deal has already been made, including a proposed fee per truck. Senior Pakistani officials indicated that reopening of Pakistani routes for NATO was imminent, with reports of a proposed fee of $5,000 per truck, a significant increase from previous levels. This fee was deemed unacceptable by the Senate Armed Services Committee, with one member calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue have not reached a resolution yet. The Pentagon is facing resistance to accepting a proposed $5,000 fee per truck for the use of Pakistani GLOCs, which was previously considered \"free\" in exchange for CSF reimbursements. The Senate Armed Services Committee deems this fee as \"extortion,\" and negotiations on the issue have not been resolved yet. Islamist extremism and militancy have plagued Pakistani society since 2001, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Pakistan also faces separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. NCTC reports a decline in terrorist incidents. Pakistan has faced Islamist extremism and militancy since 2001, with a peak in attacks in 2009. The country also deals with separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. NCTC reports a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, but Pakistan still ranks third in the world for terrorist incidents and deaths. Suicide bombings have been a growing issue, with a significant number of attacks and deaths in recent years. Militants have targeted the country's military and intelligence institutions in sometimes spectacular attacks. In Pakistan, there has been a significant increase in suicide bombings, with a peak of 84 bombings in 2009. The number dropped to 41 in 2011, but the country still accounted for nearly half of all suicide bombing deaths globally. The decline in attacks in 2011 was attributed to military operations, drone strikes, and improved law enforcement. Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have become more interconnected and supportive of each other since 2009. Some observers criticize the government for being influenced by terrorists. The Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have become more interconnected and supportive of each other since 2009. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged as a coherent grouping in late 2007, with representatives from various tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and the Haqqani Network are also active in Pakistan. U.S. leaders are concerned about Al Qaeda operating in Pakistani territory, despite recent losses in key leaders and operatives. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is a significant militant group in Pakistan with representatives from various tribal agencies and settled districts. The Haqqani Network operates in North Waziristan and Kurram agencies, while the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in Punjab is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The LeT is considered the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia. The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is a U.S.-designated terrorist group with ties to the ISI, posing a growing threat to U.S. national security. The Raymond Davis affair may have exposed new U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT in Pakistan. Analysts view the LeT as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, with potential to become a global threat. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating jihadist ideology that has claimed many Pakistani lives. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's former Ambassador to the United States, criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. sovereignty violations instead of combating jihadist ideology that has cost many Pakistani lives. He blames military dictators for cultivating anti-Western sentiment to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to increased militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to increased militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all seven FATA agencies and adjacent regions, with notable offensives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. U.S. government assessments and independent analyses paint a discouraging picture of recent military efforts in Pakistan. The Pakistani military offensives in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011 had mixed results, with temporary success in dislodging militants but no sustained progress in counterinsurgency. The air force conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA region. The Pakistani military's efforts in the FATA region have not led to sustained counterinsurgency progress. The air force has conducted over 5,500 combat sorties, targeting 4,600 locations with 80% of bombs being laser-guided. Despite some success in degrading militant capabilities, ongoing fighting in Kurram and Khyber agencies has displaced over 500,000 civilians. Insurgency still persists in most FATA agencies, with recent attacks by TTP militants in South Waziristan and Bajaur. The Pakistani army has had some success in degrading LI's capabilities in the FATA region, but a simmering insurgency still affects most agencies. TTP militants have carried out attacks in South Waziristan and Bajaur, with North Waziristan being a key haven for militants. Pakistani officials have not acted on urgent U.S. requests to address the militant presence in the region. The North Waziristan agency is a significant haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have not responded to urgent U.S. requests to address the militant presence in the region. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks the necessary hardware for effective nonconventional warfare. Islamabad's expulsion of U.S. military trainers in July 2011 has hindered efforts to enhance Pakistan's COIN capabilities. Pakistan's military operations and political approach, along with drone strikes and internal militant power struggles, have fragmented the Pakistani Taliban in 2011, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. The TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud has conflicts with other militant commanders, resulting in truce deals with the government. The TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud has conflicts with other militant commanders, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan. Mehsud has been ordered killed by his former deputy, Wali-ur-Rehman, who feels Mehsud has made the TTP too close to Al Qaeda Arabs. Pakistani officials have shown openness to negotiations with TTP militants, with meetings reportedly starting in November. Pakistani officials were open to negotiations with TTP militants in late 2011, amid US talks with Afghan Taliban. Meetings with government representatives were claimed by TTP deputy chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad, but were initially denied. Faqir was reportedly removed from his position for engaging in dialogue with the government, causing unrest among his lieutenants. Negotiations seem to have occurred and may still be ongoing, with pressure from Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar for Pakistani militants to make peace. Negotiations with TTP militants were initially denied but seem to have taken place, leading to Faqir's removal from his position. Mullah Omar has pressured Pakistani militants to make peace, with a reported pact to unify militant factions under his leadership. The Haqqanis aim to focus hostility solely on Afghanistan, ending the anti-Pakistan insurgency. The Haqqani network, along with other commanders, aims to direct hostility towards Afghanistan, shifting focus away from anti-Pakistan insurgency. The US offered a reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, causing tension in US-Pakistan relations. In April 2012, the U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the conviction of Pakistani citizen Hafiz Saeed, leader of the terrorist group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack. This move was criticized by Prime Minister Gilani as worsening U.S.-Pakistan relations. Additionally, militants freed nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot to kill President-General Pervez Musharraf, in an assault on a prison in Bannu. In April 2012, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, Pakistan, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President-General Pervez Musharraf. The raid exposed lapses in security and raised concerns about the effectiveness of Pakistan's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries during a visit to India in May 2012. U.S. officials remain concerned about the impunity of certain individuals. During a visit to New Delhi in May 2012, Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to do more to clear its territory of terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the Islamabad government for not taking sufficient action against Hafiz Saeed. U.S. officials are concerned about extremist and militant groups in Pakistan, including the Afghan Taliban in Quetta and Karachi, the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan and Kurram, and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations like LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Punjab. There are worries about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements. In 2010, concerns grew over American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based groups like LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square, claiming he received training in western Pakistan. Other cases linking U.S. citizens to terrorist plots in Pakistan are also prevalent. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing in Times Square by Faisal Shahzad, who confessed to receiving bomb-making training in western Pakistan. Shahzad was sentenced to life in prison. Other cases involve U.S. citizens and residents with links to Islamist extremism in Pakistan, including David Coleman Headley's involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, scouted for the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group multiple times from 2006 to 2008. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was linked to a retired Pakistani major suspected of being an LeT contact. Headley also had interactions with Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. In 2010, Indian officials were granted access to Headley for interrogation, revealing an official Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. Tahawwur Rana, a Canadian national, was also involved and was charged with material support. In 2010, Indian officials gained access to David Coleman Headley for interrogation, revealing official Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai attack. Headley detailed links between the ISI and terrorism, adding to tensions in U.S.-Pakistan relations. Tahawwur Rana, charged with material support, was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. Three senior LeT members, including Hafez Saeed, and a purported ISI officer named \"Major Iqbal\" were indicted in the case. The prosecution's star witness detailed links between the ISI and terrorism, adding to tensions in U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three wars and unresolved issues like Kashmiri sovereignty, has led to large defense establishments at the cost of economic and social development. A \"Composite Dialogue\" in 2004 made modest progress in bilateral relations. The partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmiri sovereignty issue have caused tension between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India. Both countries have large defense establishments, hindering economic and social development. The \"Composite Dialogue\" in 2004 made some progress, including a cease-fire and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. However, relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leaving the peace process stalled. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations deteriorated following a terrorist attack in Mumbai that killed 165 civilians. Militarized territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources emerged as another issue in 2010. Regional peace is believed to be linked to a solution of the Kashmir dispute. The US has refrained from mediating in the dispute. Pakistan and India are also engaged in a \"shadow war.\" The Obama Administration has maintained a policy of not mediating in the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India. There are allegations of a \"shadow war\" between the two countries in Afghanistan, with Pakistan accusing India of interference in its western regions. After the 2008 Mumbai attack, India held Pakistan responsible for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India focused on holding Pakistan accountable for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Despite initial reluctance, India agreed to resume peace talks in early 2011, leading to high-level discussions and the establishment of a \"terror hotline\" between the two countries. After a hiatus of more than two years, governments announced the resumption of high-level peace talks. Following \"cricket diplomacy\" in March 2011, bilateral talks led to the establishment of a \"terror hotline.\" Commerce secretaries met in April 2011 for economic cooperation discussions. A positive June meeting of foreign secretaries in Islamabad focused on confidence-building measures and increased trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. The July Joint Statement during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi was seen as a successful representation of the peace process back on track. The two countries agreed to expand confidence-building measures related to nuclear and conventional weapons, increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC, and further liberalize bilateral trade. India dropped its opposition to a proposed EU initiative waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-ravaged areas. The circumstances of OBL's death impacted relations between Pakistan and India. Dubai raises transaction costs, slows deliveries, and inflates prices. India dropped its opposition to an EU initiative waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-ravaged areas. The circumstances of OBL's death affected relations between Pakistan and India. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the killing a significant step forward in combating terrorism. New Delhi is concerned about a potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and sees an opportunity to press Pakistan to extradite terrorists linked to the 2008 Mumbai attack. New Delhi saw the discovery of OBL in Pakistan as an opportunity to press demands for extraditing terrorists linked to the 2008 Mumbai attack. Afghan President Karzai's closer ties with India raised Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Kabul's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban may have influenced the decision to align more closely with India. Pakistan's fears of encirclement increased due to Afghanistan's alignment with India, potentially hindering efforts to improve relations with Pakistan. The current state of relations between Pakistan and India is relatively stable, with a decrease in separatist activities in Indian-held Kashmir. Pakistan also pledged to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India in late 2011. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with a decrease in separatist activities in Indian-held Kashmir. Pakistan pledged to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India in late 2011, which could significantly boost bilateral trade and build peace constituencies in both countries. Islamabad's move towards freer bilateral trade suggests a positive shift in their long-held stance. Pakistan's offer to increase bilateral trade with India and move towards freer trade suggests a positive shift in their long-held stance. There have been no terrorist attacks in India traced to Pakistan in over three years, and President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked a significant diplomatic step. In April 2012, President Zardari made a historic visit to India, the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the ongoing conflict over Kashmir. Despite the tragedy, both governments remain unwilling to redeploy forces. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed agreements with Turkmenistan to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to construct a 1,100-mile-long gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US for regional energy integration. Despite skepticism about Afghanistan's security, the project aims to bypass Iran and promote investor confidence. Many independent observers doubt that Afghanistan's security will improve enough to attract investors, despite the New Silk Road Initiative aiming to bypass Iran. India's willingness to make concessions is limited by ongoing Islamist militancy from Pakistan, with tensions over the Mumbai attacks and the presence of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan. India seeks extradition of suspects and criticizes Islamabad for not acting on evidence. Pakistan's failure to bring Mumbai terrorism masterminds to justice, including LeT chief Hafiz Saeed, is a major point of contention with India. New Delhi also seeks extradition of Ibrahim and Indian Mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan. The relationship between Pakistan and China has been historically close and mutually beneficial, with China being a primary arms supplier for Pakistan. China's significant role as a primary arms supplier for Pakistan dates back to the 1960s, including the construction of arms factories and supply of complete weapons systems. Chinese presence in the Pakistani economy is widespread, with plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan. The two countries signed multiple cooperative agreements during Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in 2010, designating 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" China intends to build two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. During Premier Wen Jiabao's 2010 visit to Islamabad, China and Pakistan signed multiple cooperative agreements, with contracts worth $15 billion in various sectors. In 2011, Pakistan quickly responded to China's concerns about terrorist activities, sending ISI Director Pasha to Beijing. China has since expressed more open concerns about the situation. In August 2011, Pakistan responded swiftly to China's concerns about terrorist activities, sending ISI Director Pasha to Beijing. China has expressed worries about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. As U.S.-Pakistan ties deteriorate, Pakistan is increasingly relying on its friendship with China. Pakistani leaders have been effusive in their expressions of closeness with China since 2011. Pakistani leaders have strengthened ties with China since 2011, with Beijing providing military support including fighter jets and submarines. This shift in allegiance comes as U.S.-Pakistan relations deteriorate. The United States and China are working together to strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities, with China recognizing the potential harm to its economic interests from Pakistan-based terrorist groups. This cooperation could lead to improved discipline in Pakistan's military and intelligence services and pressure on Islamabad to dismantle global jihadist groups. Despite differing views on India's regional role, the U.S. and China may expand their cooperation in this area. The United States and China are working together to strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities, with China recognizing the potential harm to its economic interests from Pakistan-based terrorist groups. This cooperation could lead to improved discipline in Pakistan's military and intelligence services and pressure on Islamabad to dismantle global jihadist groups. Additionally, the United States and China could expand cooperation into other vital areas, including nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. Chinese military and diplomatic support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, and as the U.S. deepens its partnership with India, China's reliance on Pakistan is likely to grow. However, China's own interests suggest that its Pakistan policies should not solely focus on balancing India. China's geostrategic reliance on Pakistan is expected to increase as the United States strengthens its partnership with India. However, China's own interests indicate that its policies towards Pakistan should not only be about balancing India. The \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan no longer guarantees unconditional support, and China is unlikely to mediate in any U.S.-Pakistani rift or replace Washington as Islamabad's main foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups, but both countries still cooperate in certain areas. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and anti-Shia terrorist groups. Despite this, both countries cooperate on a gas pipeline project, which the US opposes due to sanctions on Iran. The US opposes a gas pipeline project between Pakistan and Iran due to sanctions on Iran. China withdrew from the project, and the US offered $500 million to finance construction on Pakistan's side. Despite US opposition, Pakistan remains determined to complete the project. Iran has been seeking barter deals with Pakistan to trade oil for wheat and rice. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top concern for the US. Tehran seeks barter deals with Pakistan for oil in exchange for wheat and rice. Concerns persist over the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, especially with the influence of Islamist militants. Despite improvements, analysts warn of potential risks from past illicit proliferation networks. Metallurgist A.Q. Khan's nuclear network was exposed in 2004, but no charges have been brought against him or his Pakistani co-conspirators. Concerns remain about the network's possible continued existence. Pakistan's nuclear security has improved, but there are worries about leakage of know-how or technology. Recent reports suggest Pakistan is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. nuclear cooperation with India. China's plans to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan may violate international guidelines. The Obama Administration is seeking civil nuclear cooperation with India and wants Pakistan to join nonproliferation regimes. Pakistan has a rapidly growing nuclear arsenal, with China planning to build reactors there in violation of guidelines. The proposed deal poses a dilemma for the US, as Pakistan faces economic challenges exacerbated by flooding in 2010 and 2011. Corruption is also a serious issue in Pakistan. The economic challenges in Pakistan, worsened by flooding in 2010 and 2011, include food and energy shortages, corruption hindering investment rates, and a decline in foreign direct investment. Increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad are identified as major factors. Addressing inflation is a priority for Pakistan's economic development. The economic challenges in Pakistan worsened by flooding in 2010 and 2011, with a decline in foreign direct investment.

Pakistan's GDP per capita was once higher than India's, but India's growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, leading to higher national wealth figures. Pakistan's GDP per capita was once higher than India's, but India's growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis led Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. The current IMF-supported program is a 34-month, $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement. $3.6 billion is yet to be disbursed due to Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms. In 2009, Pakistan sought multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed due to failure to implement required reforms. Security concerns in 2011 further delayed negotiations with the IMF, prompting Pakistan to seek U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions. Repayment of IMF loans will heavily impact Islamabad's federal budget. Pakistan sought U.S. help to influence the IMF to relax conditions and release outstanding tranches. Repayment of IMF loans will strain Islamabad's budget due to low revenue generation and high military spending. Secretary Clinton criticized Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio. Efforts to implement tax reforms have faced parliamentary opposition. Pakistan's economic challenges include low tax revenue, failed tax reform initiatives, political turmoil over fuel subsidies, and electricity shortages leading to business closures and public protests. Textile businesses in Pakistan are struggling due to power shortages, leading to shutdowns. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent. Despite economic growth, the country faces challenges such as inflation, unemployment, and terrorism. A recent poll revealed that 52% of people consider inflation as the most pressing issue in Pakistan, surpassing unemployment and terrorism. Despite economic growth of 2.4% in the fiscal year ending June 2011, challenges like public debt, double-digit inflation, and energy shortages continue to hinder growth. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledged that the devastating floods in FY2011 exposed structural deficiencies in the economy, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. The Pakistani economy faces acute power shortages and delays in implementing tax reforms and subsidy phase-outs, leading to a potential 4% reduction in GDP growth. International financial institutions highlight governance issues as the root cause of economic challenges, with a deteriorated fiscal situation and lack of expected improvements. The \"Country Partnership Strategy Report\" for FY2010-FY2014 acknowledges challenges faced by the Islamabad government and international donors post devolution of key functions to provincial governments. The report highlights a deteriorated fiscal situation, lack of governance improvements, and significant macroeconomic risks. The World Bank recommends focusing on human development sectors like education and health to prevent poverty alleviation setbacks. An IMF report from February 2012 bluntly states that Pakistan's near- and middle-term prospects are unfavorable due to low growth, high inflation, and weakening external position.

Urgent policy action is needed to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and reduce inflation. Pakistani leaders seek better access to Western markets, with a focus on boosting exports, particularly from the textile sector. Islamabad is pushing for reduced tariffs on textile exports to increase revenue and create jobs. The textile sector in Pakistan employs 3.5 million people and makes up 40% of urban factory jobs. Abolishing American tariffs on cotton apparel could increase exports by $5 billion annually. Pakistan's democracy has faced challenges with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs.

Economic chaos is a concern due to political turmoil and deficits. Threats to the government's majority status have arisen from coalition politics. Pakistan's political turmoil has led to economic chaos, with widening deficits. The PPP government faced threats to its majority status due to coalition politics, with the MQM withdrawing and rejoining multiple times in 2011. Each withdrawal was seen as a tactic to gain more control in Karachi. In May 2011, the PPP formed a new alliance to strengthen its standing. In 2011, the MQM's withdrawal from the ruling coalition led to a loss of parliamentary majority, potentially causing government collapse. The PPP strengthened its position through an alliance with the PML-Q faction, gaining support in Punjab and preparing to contest the next general elections. The ANP, a PPP coalition ally, also governs the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The PPP's alliance with PML-Q in Punjab and gains in Senate elections bolstered its status, posing a threat to PML-Nawaz. OBL's death led to rare criticism of the Pakistani military, creating an opportunity for civilian leaders to increase control. The circumstances of OBL's death were embarrassing for the Pakistani military, leading to domestic criticism and an opportunity for civilian leaders to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Media criticism of the security establishment continued throughout the year, but there has been little indication that civilians will take advantage of this opening. Parliament did seat a commission to investigate how bin Laden was found. Criticism of the security establishment continued at unprecedented levels throughout the year. Despite calls for investigation into bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan and American forces penetrating Pakistani territory, civilian authority remained limited.

Calls for repeal intensified in 2010 after a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death for a minor offense. Despite efforts for reform, government backed away after pressure from Islamist hardline groups. Notable politicians advocating for reform were assassinated, leaving National Assembly member Sherry Rehman as the sole prominent figure pursuing change. In 2011, reform efforts in Pakistan were hindered by pressure from Islamist hardline groups, leading to the assassination of key government proponents. National Assembly member Sherry Rehman, the only remaining advocate for reform, was forced to withdraw her proposal. Despite this, Congress continued to provide significant financial assistance to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion in overt aid by the end of the year. In 2009, Congress passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) authorizing increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and establishing the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy.
