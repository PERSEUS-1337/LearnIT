A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, providing confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy budget. Extensions for competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation are also discussed. Empirical evidence from clinical datasets shows the method's utility and strong privacy guarantees. The survival function is crucial for modeling time to an event, with potential privacy risks in clinical research. Adversaries can reconstruct user-level data from published estimates, leading to sensitive information disclosure. This scenario highlights the importance of privacy protection in medical analytics. The survival function is used for modeling time to an event in various domains, including healthcare. Information leakage in healthcare is a serious issue, with personal healthcare information being the most sensitive private attribute. The focus of this study is on privacy protection in medical analytics, particularly in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method. The study focuses on privacy protection in medical analytics, specifically on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method. There is a lack of models providing formal privacy guarantees for this estimation, with only one related work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017). Statistical agencies worldwide use the Kaplan-Meier method to report on population survival or disease-related survival estimates. Current models lack formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation. Existing work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) perturbs regression modeling for event data but is limited to multivariate models. Generative models like differentially private GANs could potentially be used to estimate survival function, but GANs struggle with generalization. The first differentially private method for estimating the survival function based on the Kaplan-Meier method is proposed. This method guarantees the differentially private estimation of the survival function and can also provide differentially private confidence intervals. Generative models like GANs are not well-suited for the small sample size, constrained dimensionality, and mixed variable types typically encountered in this use-case. The first differentially private method for estimating the survival function based on the Kaplan-Meier method is proposed, ensuring privacy while providing confidence intervals and test statistics. The method extends to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation and has been validated on real clinical datasets. An R package is released for easy adoption. The proposed method for estimating the survival function in clinical research provides strong privacy guarantees and good utility. It is validated using real-life clinical datasets and released as an R package for easy accessibility. The survival function models time to event data, accounting for censored observations, which is crucial for accurate estimation. The survival function estimates the probability of not having an event by a certain time, considering censored observations. Various parametric and non-parametric methods can be used for estimation. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric method used in survival analysis to estimate the survival function without making assumptions on the distribution of survival times. It focuses on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time, resulting in a step function for the survival estimate. The Kaplan-Meier estimator focuses on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time, resulting in a step function for the survival estimate. Differential privacy provides a provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms, ensuring similar behavior on similar input datasets. Differential privacy ensures privacy for randomized algorithms by preserving privacy guarantees even after post-processing. It focuses on maintaining privacy when datasets only differ in one row and provides stronger privacy guarantees with smaller values of ( , \u03b4). Theorem 1 states that differential privacy remains intact even after post-processing, meaning an adversary cannot increase privacy loss by acting on the output of a differentially private algorithm. This concept is crucial in our approach for estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method while ensuring differential privacy. Our method allows for estimating various accompanying statistics in a differentially private manner. Our approach ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. We can estimate various statistics in a differentially private way without extra privacy budget. The dataset includes time points, subjects at risk, and events experienced. Our approach ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. A dataset with time points, subjects at risk, and events experienced is used to create a matrix M. L1 sensitivity is used to draw a noise matrix Z from the Laplace distribution, and a differentially private version of M is created by adding Z. Algorithm 1 is presented for this method. Our method ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. A matrix M is created from a dataset, and a noise matrix Z is added to create a differentially private version of M. Algorithm 1 outlines this process, highlighting its simplicity and computational efficiency. This method can be easily implemented using existing software packages. The proposed method ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. Algorithm 1 is -differentially private with no computational overhead compared to the original estimation. The L 1 sensitivity of the method is two, as it only contains count variables for events and at-risk individuals. The L 1 sensitivity of the method is two, ensuring differential privacy in estimating the survival function. Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise to the counts. The approach can be easily extended to other essential statistics. The approach ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function by using (r j , d j ) to calculate the survival function. It can be extended to include confidence intervals and test statistics for comparing survival function distributions. This allows for group comparison, such as in clinical trials, with privacy guarantees. The approach ensures differential privacy in estimating survival function by using (r j , d j ) to calculate it. Confidence intervals and test statistics can be included for comparing survival function distributions, allowing for group comparison with privacy guarantees. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, ensuring differential privacy in the calculations. The calculations for obtaining confidence intervals for survival function estimates are differentially private. Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals are used, and by replacing certain components with their differentially private counterparts, the confidence intervals become differentially private as well. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are made differentially private by using Greenwood's formula and replacing components with their differentially private counterparts. This ensures privacy without needing additional access to sensitive data. Hypothesis tests, like the Logrank test, can be used to compare survival function estimates between groups, such as infection rates in clinical trials. Using Algorithm 6, hypothesis testing with the Logrank test is made differentially private. The Logrank test statistic is replaced with differentially private counterparts, ensuring privacy without revealing sensitive information. The Logrank test statistic (Z) is made differentially private by replacing the observed and expected number of failures with their private counterparts using Algorithm 1. This ensures privacy without compromising sensitive information, allowing for the output of confidence intervals and the test statistic without using additional privacy budget. The Logrank test statistic is made differentially private using Algorithm 1, allowing for output of confidence intervals and the test statistic without using additional privacy budget. Competing events, like death in HIV progression scenarios, require specialized estimates to avoid biased estimates. One such estimate is the competing risk cumulative incidence. Competing events in clinical data, such as death in HIV progression scenarios, require specialized estimates to avoid bias. The competing risk cumulative incidence, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator, is widely used in the literature. Using Algorithm 1, we can extend differential privacy to competing risk scenarios, ensuring that the cumulative incidence estimates are -differentially private. Using our method, the cumulative incidence estimates in competing risk scenarios can be made differentially private. This includes statistics like confidence intervals, hazard function, and hazard ratios, ensuring privacy while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, our method can be extended to provide a differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard. The differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard can be obtained using our method.

Small sample sizes result in worse utility for differential privacy estimation. The study evaluates differentially private estimates of the survival function using real-life clinical datasets. As the dataset size decreases, the utility of differentially private estimation worsens. Median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates reported with survival function. Our method estimates the median with high precision. The study evaluates differentially private estimates of the survival function using real-life clinical datasets. Median survival time is defined as the time point when the survival function attains the value of 0.5, with confidence intervals serving as the confidence intervals of the median survival. Results show high precision in estimating the median, even in high privacy regimes. Some cases, like Myeloid and Ovarian datasets, have high survival making it impossible to estimate upper bounds on confidence intervals.
