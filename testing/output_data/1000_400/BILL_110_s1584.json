    "content": "The \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections and adds new findings and purposes to the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Survey of the Coast, established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, evolved into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providing various services related to surveying, mapping, and water observations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides services related to hydrographic surveying, mapping, and water observations to support marine transportation and economic prosperity. The Nation's marine transportation system is increasingly congested, with the volume of international maritime commerce expected to double in the next 20 years. Nearly half of the cargo transiting U.S. waters is oil, refined petroleum products, or other hazardous substances. Hydrographic data and services support national needs for emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and coastal resiliency to sea-level rise and other hazards. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a key role in establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, including emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, coastal resiliency, ocean and coastal science advancement, and integrated ocean observing systems. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in collaboration with other agencies and states, is the leading authority for setting national standards for hydrographic data. The Director of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and represents the U.S. internationally. NOAA's hydrographic expertise is crucial for establishing marine boundaries and territorial limits, such as the Exclusive Economic Zone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a key role in setting national standards for hydrographic data, including marine boundaries and territorial limits like the Exclusive Economic Zone. The purposes of this Act are to enhance NOAA's capabilities, provide accurate hydrographic data, and promote the development and application of new technologies for various benefits. The Act aims to enhance NOAA's abilities, provide precise hydrographic data for safe trade and commerce, support homeland security and emergency response, and promote coastal resiliency. The Act aims to support homeland security, emergency response, ecosystem approaches to marine management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services with various applications such as storm surge monitoring, habitat restoration, and more accurate environmental assessments. It also promotes improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations through increased coordination and cooperation, as well as research and development in hydrographic data and related technologies. The Act aims to support homeland security, emergency response, ecosystem approaches to marine management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services for storm surge monitoring, habitat restoration, and more accurate environmental assessments. It also promotes improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations through increased coordination and cooperation, as well as research and development in hydrographic data and related technologies to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and availability. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services. This includes the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of information related to bathymetry, hydrography, geodesy, geospatial data, geomagnetism, and tide, water level, and current observations. The amendment to Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 includes changes to paragraphs (4)(A) and (5) related to the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of hydrographic data, including bathymetry, nautical charts, and geodetic information. The term 'Coast and Geodetic Survey Act' is also defined within the amendment. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and provide hydrographic services. The amendment to Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 expands the duties of the Administration to include providing hydrographic services, procuring necessary equipment for safe navigation, and maintaining expertise in hydrographic data acquisition. The Administrator may procure, operate vessels, equipment, and technologies for safe navigation and hydrographic data acquisition. They shall design, maintain real-time monitoring systems for navigation safety. Additionally, they may acquire data to support coastal and ocean resource conservation. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services for safe navigation, conservation of coastal resources, and emergency response to disasters and homeland security needs. They have the authority to create joint centers and enter into necessary agreements to fulfill these purposes. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter agreements, and acquire hydrographic data for safe navigation, coastal resource conservation, disaster response, and homeland security needs. They can also award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Changes to quality assurance program under Section 305 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 are made by amending subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). Additionally, changes in the Hydrographic Services Review Panel are also implemented. Amendments are made to Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, including changing subsection numbers and the composition of the panel. Voting members must be qualified in hydrographic-related disciplines. Amendments to the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 include changing the composition of the panel to have qualified, voting members in hydrographic-related disciplines. Voting members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in performing their duties. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for carrying out the Act."
