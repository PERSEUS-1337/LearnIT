    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, including market-oriented mechanisms. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal was compared to bills by Senators Jeffords and Carper, with the Administration initially reluctant to conduct the study due to cost and difficulty. The Administration has conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the \"Clear Skies\" proposal and bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper, after initially being reluctant to do so. This analysis was prompted by the failure of the Clear Skies bill to advance in Congress due to concerns about the lack of comparison with other bills. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson promised to conduct the analysis, which has now been released. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution, emitting gases like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These pollutants pose risks to human health and welfare. EPA has finalized rules to regulate mercury, and carbon dioxide may also pose indirect risks. Electric utility generating facilities emit gases like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, which pose risks to human health. EPA has regulations in place for some pollutants, but carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise. In 2003, fossil-fuel-fired plants accounted for a significant portion of emissions. In 2003, fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants in the US accounted for a significant portion of SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions. Additionally, about 45 tons of mercury emissions came from these plants. The evolution of air pollution controls has led to a complex system of regulations, with ongoing efforts to implement further controls. The evolution of air pollution controls has led to a complex system of regulations in the US, with ongoing efforts to implement further controls on greenhouse gases and toxic air pollutants like mercury. The current administration has rejected mandatory limits on emissions in favor of a voluntary reduction program. States agreed to voluntary limits on CO2 emissions. The Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol for a voluntary reduction program. The Senate passed a resolution for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases. Efforts are being made to simplify the air quality control regime with a \"multi-pollutant\" approach targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions. The new approach involves regulatory and economic mechanisms to control utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2. It aims to balance environmental goals with industry stability. This approach has been incorporated into existing law through finalized rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR, focusing on reducing emissions that impair visibility and environmental quality. More reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions are expected. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) and Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) aim to cap emissions of Hg from coal-fired power plants and focus on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions that impair visibility. With new air quality standards in effect, further reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions are necessary. Concerns also exist about mercury emissions affecting water bodies. Mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants are a major concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories for mercury. Legislation addressing power plant pollution in a comprehensive way could achieve health and environmental goals more effectively. In the 109th Congress, six bills were introduced to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. In the 109th Congress, six bills were introduced to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Legislation like \"Clear Skies\" aims to address emissions from electric generating facilities through tradeable allowances, with key debates on the stringency of caps and reduction mandates. The congressional debate on multi-pollutant controls for utilities focuses on the stringency of caps, reduction mandates, and inclusion of carbon dioxide emissions. Bills aim for 70%-90% reductions in emissions like NOx, SO2, and mercury, with the Clear Skies bill being the least stringent. Deadlines for reductions are set for 2018, but actual targets may not be met for a decade due to banking provisions allowing utilities to build up credits for future use. The Clear Skies bill aims for 70%-90% reductions in emissions like NOx, SO2, and mercury, with deadlines set for 2018. However, due to banking provisions, actual targets may not be met until 2026 or later, as utilities can overcomply in early years and use credits for future reductions. The Clear Skies bill aims for 70%-90% reductions in emissions like NOx, SO2, and mercury with deadlines set for 2018. However, overcompliance in early years may lead to delays in meeting targets until 2026 or later due to banking provisions. The Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier and more stringent caps on emissions, allowing utilities to reach full compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, while the Jeffords and Carper bills do, potentially affecting compliance strategies and market dynamics. The Clear Skies bill does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. The cost-benefit analysis by the EPA examined various options, showing little difference between the Clear Skies options. It may be best to simplify the discussion to three principal choices. The EPA's analysis compared the Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords bills, showing little difference between the options. The most recent version of Clear Skies was chosen for examination. The baseline assumes no additional action on emissions without new legislation. The EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis assumes no additional action on emissions without new legislation, despite recent rules finalized by EPA. The analysis uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as a baseline for clean air regulation. The EPA included three regulations as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling pollutants, using the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as a baseline for clean air regulation. Uncertainty exists regarding the specific provisions and implementation of multi-pollutant legislation, with potential changes in deadlines and regulations. The 109th Congress or later versions may adjust deadlines in the 2003 proposal. The Managers' Mark is subject to change if the Committee revisits it. Regulations for passed legislation may face uncertainties and delays. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity and Short-term Construction Constraints. The cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity, Short-term Construction Constraints, and Electricity Demand Growth scenarios. EPA analyzes different scenarios for demand response, construction constraints, and natural gas supply. The market will respond to demand for new equipment in a timely fashion. EPA analyzes scenarios with different electricity demand growth rates and natural gas prices. Four scenarios were developed based on these assumptions. EPA developed four scenarios based on different assumptions regarding price elasticity, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply. The scenarios include Base Case, No Construction Constraint, Demand Response, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis, which includes zero price elasticity and short-term construction constraints. The scenario is chosen based on key factors and lack of alternative combinations. Including a short-term demand response function in the modeling is supported by established electricity price elasticities in the literature. EPA's decision to incorporate this refinement in their Demand Response Scenario is well within the suggested range in the literature. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario includes short-term price elasticities within the literature's suggested range. EPA's assumption on boilermaker labor availability for SO2 and NOx control equipment construction is debatable. EPA incorporated this assumption in the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) regulatory rulemaking. The EPA assumed limited boilermaker labor for constructing SO2 and NOx control equipment until 2010, with unlimited labor available thereafter. This assumption was questioned by the Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) during the rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). ICAC found no constraint on construction even if the deadline was moved to 2010, stating that the air pollution control industry can install significant amounts of equipment in short periods of time. ICAC found no constraint on construction for CAIR, stating the air pollution control industry can install equipment quickly. Resources for projected installations under IAQR are sufficient, with factors like modular construction and non-union labor reducing demand for union boilermakers. The projected installations under IAQR will require air pollution control installations, but resources are not expected to be limiting. Factors like modular construction and non-union labor will reduce demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor is available if needed. There will be sufficient capacity to complete the IAQR and control installations for 2010 and 2015, with the possibility of completing the 2015 requirements by 2010. Limited boilermaker availability only affects the two most stringent requirements. The availability of boilermakers will be sufficient to carry out the projected IAQR and control installations for 2010 and 2015, with the potential to complete the 2015 requirements by 2010. Limited boilermaker availability only impacts the two most stringent alternatives. Despite questions about assumptions, it is deemed more important to include a demand elasticity function in the analysis. The EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case for the benchmark analysis, prioritizing the inclusion of a demand elasticity function over addressing feasibility constraints. Sensitivity analysis is crucial for understanding cost estimates due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply projections. EPA's natural gas supply curves project more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's, with one scenario showing steeper EIA supply curves for Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. The EPA's demand response scenario is used for the benchmark analysis, focusing on demand elasticity over feasibility constraints. Sensitivity analysis is crucial for cost estimates due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply projections. EPA's supply curves project more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's, with one scenario showing steeper EIA supply curves for Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. The 15-year timeframe allows for debate on future supplies' representation. The analysis questions EPA's feasibility constraints and the historic volatility of the natural gas market, using the Demand Response Scenario as a basis. Clear Skies bill is the most cost-effective option with minimal costs and benefits compared to other bills. The provisions for Hg are weak in Clear Skies. Clear Skies bill has minimal costs and benefits compared to other bills, with weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act for cost-effectiveness, providing $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010, much less than Carper and Jeffords bills. The Clear Skies bill offers minimal benefits compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, with lower annual benefits of $6 billion in 2010. This is due to less stringent pollution caps and a more relaxed implementation schedule. The Clear Skies bill has minimal benefits compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, with less stringent pollution caps and a relaxed implementation schedule. EPA's analysis shows that Clear Skies has no additional cost when compared to current Clean Air Act requirements, with benefits equal to only 10% of newly promulgated rules in 2010 and 2% in 2020. This suggests EPA's success in incorporating Clear Skies' market-based regulatory scheme. However, opponents argue that current law requirements are just as effective as Clear Skies. The analysis compares the benefits of different pollution control bills. Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) shows the greatest benefits, exceeding those of the Carper bill and Clear Skies. In 2010, Jeffords' bill would have $83 billion in benefits annually, 14 times more than Clear Skies. In 2020, its benefits would be $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times those of the Carper bill and 22 times those of Clear Skies. EPA's analysis suggests the success of incorporating Clear Skies' regulatory scheme, but opponents argue that current law requirements are equally effective. In 2020, the benefits of Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) continue to exceed those of other bills, with estimated annual benefits of $66 billion, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. EPA's analysis highlights the cost and benefit estimates for the proposals, with S. 150 being the most costly bill. The Jeffords bill faces short-term construction constraints due to a shortage of skilled labor for installing scrubbers in coal-fired power plants by 2010. The Jeffords bill (S. 150) represents the mid-point of the range provided by EPA and is the most costly bill. Due to short-term construction constraints, a shortage of skilled labor may limit the installation of scrubbers in coal-fired power plants by 2010. This bill would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a significant increase in renewable fuel generators and oil- and gas-fired capacity. In contrast, coal use would increase under Clear Skies or the Carper bill. The Jeffords bill (S. 150) would require a significant increase in renewable fuel generators and oil- and gas-fired capacity, leading to additional generation from renewable sources. The bill aims to achieve substantial emission reductions beyond those in the Clean Air Act, with costs and benefits exceeding those of Clear Skies and the Carper bill. S. 843 aims to achieve substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with lower costs and benefits compared to S. 150 but higher than Clear Skies. The bill includes a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term constraints and a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce emissions at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on key variables like price elasticity and electricity growth. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on key variables like price elasticity, short-term construction constraints, and electricity growth to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. Different scenarios were examined, including a No Construction Constraint Scenario and an EPA Base Case Scenario. The EPA analyzed different scenarios to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, including the No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints but includes a zero demand price elasticity assumption. This swap of assumptions has minimal impact on S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints and includes a zero demand price elasticity assumption. This has minimal impact on S. 843 and the Managers' Mark, but significantly increases the cost of S. 150 due to the lack of demand-side reaction from consumers. The removal of any price elasticity in S. 150 leads to significant cost increases in both short (36%) and long-term (157%) scenarios. The EPA Base Case Scenario shows a 63% increase in 2010 and 147% increase in 2020 over the benchmark analysis for S. 150. The removal of any price elasticity in S. 843 results in an 86% higher cost estimate for 2010 compared to the benchmark analysis. Demand response and short-term construction constraint assumptions heavily influence EPA's 2010 cost estimates for S. 843, while having little effect on long-term or Managers' Mark cost estimates. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario significantly impacts cost estimates for S. 150 by combining zero demand response, higher electricity growth, and tighter natural gas supply, resulting in higher costs compared to the EPA Base Case assumptions. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario removes demand price elasticity, leading to higher costs for S. 150 due to increased electricity demand and tighter natural gas supply. The impact is most pronounced for S. 150 in 2020, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity significantly affects the short and long-term costs of S. 150. The sensitivity analysis shows that EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity has a significant impact on the short and long-term costs of S. 150. This effect is more pronounced when higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions are considered, especially in the long term. While the removal of short-term construction constraints lessens the impact in the short term, it does not fully eliminate it. The assumption of zero demand price elasticity also affects S. 843, with similar effects in the short term that decrease over time due to its less aggressive timeline. The EPA's assumptions of zero demand price elasticity and short-term construction constraints have a significant impact on S. 843 in the short term, but this effect decreases over time. The Managers' Mark, based on EPA's model, has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. Senator Jeffords' S. 150 and Senator Carper's S. 843 both include provisions to reduce carbon emissions. The Managers' Mark, based on EPA's model, has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. Senator Jeffords' S. 150 and Senator Carper's S. 843 both include provisions to reduce carbon emissions, with S. 843 having lower costs for CO2 allowances compared to S. 150. The EPA estimates that carbon dioxide allowance prices will decrease from 2.454 billion tons in 2009 to 2.454 billion tons in 2013 under S. 843, resulting in lower costs compared to S. 150. The costs for carbon dioxide reduction are estimated to be $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, similar to current European Union prices. The EPA estimates that carbon dioxide allowance prices will decrease from 2.454 billion tons in 2009 to 2.454 billion tons in 2013 under S. 843, resulting in lower costs compared to S. 150. The costs for carbon dioxide reduction are estimated to be $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, similar to current European Union prices. The analysis may overstate the cost of emission controls for mercury by a substantial margin due to advancements in control technology since 2003. The analysis of emission controls for mercury in 2005 may overstate costs due to advancements in technology since 2003. The cost of activated carbon injection controls has decreased significantly. EPA's analysis of S. 150 shows benefits outweighing costs. The cost of emission controls for mercury in 2005 is only one-fourth of what it was in 2003. EPA's analysis of S. 150 shows benefits outweighing costs, with 40% of coal-fired plants expected to shut down by 2010 under the bill. The benefits mainly come from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles, resulting in reduced mortality. Some health effects avoided by the proposals are summarized in Table 6. Table 6 summarizes selected health effects avoided by the proposals, including benefits from reducing SO2 emissions and mercury deposition. Environmental benefits such as acid deposition and regional haze effects were not monetized in the analysis. Mercury deposition has led to fish consumption advisories and economic impacts. The analysis did not estimate the significant environmental benefits of reducing SO2 emissions and the formation of regional haze. It also did not model mercury health effects, which could have economic impacts. The omission of these benefits has the greatest effect on proposals with more aggressive control schemes for SO2, NOx, and Hg. The economic benefits of reducing mercury health effects range from a few million to several billion dollars per year. Omitting these benefits would significantly impact proposals with aggressive mercury control schemes. The analysis did not consider the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which could underestimate the potential benefits of certain bills. The Jeffords bill, which is the most aggressive in controlling CO2, may be disadvantaged due to this omission. The Jeffords bill is more aggressive in controlling CO2 emissions compared to Clear Skies. EPA's analysis shows that the Jeffords and Carper bills have more benefits than costs, with stricter standards than the promulgated rules. The cost of reducing carbon dioxide depends on the proposed reductions, with S. 843 having nominal carbon costs. The Jeffords and Carper bills set more stringent standards than the promulgated rules, with benefits outweighing additional costs. Carbon dioxide costs vary based on reduction amounts and schedules. S. 843 has nominal carbon dioxide reduction costs due to modest requirements and relaxed implementation. Mercury control costs depend on data timeliness, with EPA's analysis lacking current cost data. EPA's benefit analysis is limited, disadvantaging alternatives with stricter standards. EPA's analysis, while a step towards understanding legislative impacts, is not as useful as hoped. The EPA's benefit analysis on Hg controls is limited and incomplete, favoring Clear Skies alternatives with overstated costs. Assumptions in the analysis penalize short-term pollution reduction and fail to consider natural gas price volatility. The analysis is outdated, based on 2003 assumptions, impacting implementation strategies and costs. The analysis on Hg controls lacks consideration of natural gas price volatility and is based on outdated 2003 assumptions, impacting implementation strategies and costs. Some argue that it is no longer up-to-date for congressional debate."
