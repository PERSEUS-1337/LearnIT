Neuron editing is introduced to address this issue by learning how neurons encode edits for specific transformations in a latent space. This technique uses an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and generate transformed data through editing transformations on those neurons. Neuron editing is a technique introduced to address the issue of neural networks struggling to generalize transformations outside of their training data. It uses an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and generate transformed data through editing transformations on those neurons. This technique allows for encoding complex transformations with simpler distribution shifts in the neuron's activations. It has been showcased in image domain/style transfer and two biological applications: removal of batch artifacts and modeling the effect of drug treatments. Our technique focuses on image domain/style transfer and two biological applications: removing batch artifacts and modeling drug treatment effects to predict synergy between drugs. Experiments in biology often study treatment effects on samples, like groups of cells receiving drugs. Mathematical modeling these effects and interactions with context can help generalize treatment outcomes beyond measured samples. We propose a neural network-based method for this purpose. The text discusses the use of neural networks for learning a general edit function corresponding to treatment in a biological setting. It contrasts traditional methods that do not model interactions with context, proposing a more powerful approach to assess treatment generalization. The focus is on reframing the problem as learning a general edit function rather than specific data manifold mapping. The text proposes a new approach called neuron editing, using an autoencoder neural network with non-linear activations to learn an edit function between pre-and post-treatment data versions. This method aims to generalize treatment effects across different datasets by reframing the problem as learning a general edit function rather than specific data manifold mapping. The text introduces neuron editing, a method using an autoencoder neural network to transform pre-and post-treatment data by editing neurons in the latent space. This process involves extracting differences in activation distributions and applying them to generate synthetic post-treatment data, enabling complex multivariate edits in a denoised feature space. Neuron editing with an autoencoder neural network involves transforming pre-and post-treatment data by editing neurons in the latent space, enabling complex multivariate edits in a denoised feature space. The focus is on modeling distribution-to-distribution transformations between large samples in high-dimensional space. In this work, the focus is on leveraging the advantages of autoencoders for modeling complex distribution-to-distribution transformations in high-dimensional space. Autoencoders perform non-linear dimensionality reduction to simplify data effects, making it computationally efficient. Editing neurons in the internal layer allows for modeling context dependence. Autoencoders simplify data effects by finding intrinsic dimensions that straighten data curvature. Editing neurons in the internal layer allows for modeling context dependence, with some neurons showing drastic changes post-treatment. These edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in complex ways, potentially providing more predictive treatment outcomes. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of autoencoders allows for modeling context dependence and avoiding noise, leading to more predictive treatment outcomes. This editing process assumes semantic consistency across data, ensuring significant dimensions are retained while noise dimensions are discarded. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of autoencoders ensures significant dimensions are retained while noise dimensions are discarded. The assumption of semantic consistency across data allows for better extrapolation compared to generative models. Neuron editing in hidden layers of autoencoders retains significant dimensions and discards noise dimensions, ensuring better extrapolation compared to generative models. Neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs, demonstrating better extrapolation and complex variation. Comparisons with traditional GANs and CycleGAN show the effectiveness of neuron editing in preserving existing data variation. Neuron editing is compared to traditional GANs and CycleGAN for generating residuals. While GANs struggle with generating plausible points, neuron editing excels in retaining data variation and improving extrapolation. The method is further detailed, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in biological applications. The decoder learns to undo transformations during training and reconstruct the input unchanged. The neuron editing method is detailed, followed by the extrapolation problem in natural image domain transfer. Two biological applications where extrapolation is essential are discussed: correcting artificial variability introduced by measuring instruments (batch effects) and predicting the combined effects of multiple drug treatments (combinatorial drug effects).GANs learn a transformation with specific properties for source and target distributions. The text discusses the use of GANs to learn a transformation that aligns source and target distributions. Instead of directly learning this transformation, an encoder/decoder pair is trained to map data into an abstract neuron space. This space is decomposed into high-level features to enable decoding. The text introduces a transformation method called NeuronEdit, which aligns distributions of activations from different sources without direct learning. An encoder/decoder pair is trained to map data into an abstract neuron space with high-level features for decoding. NeuronEdit is a piecewise linear transformation that aligns distributions of activations from different sources without direct learning. It operates on distributions represented via activations over network input samples, transforming them based on the difference between source and target distributions. NeuronEdit function aligns distributions of activations from different sources without direct learning. It transforms input activation distribution based on the difference between source and target distributions, with properties similar to a GAN generator. The transformation can be applied to extrapolation distribution X by cascading the transformations applied to neuron activations. The NeuronEdit function aligns distributions of activations from different sources without direct learning, similar to a GAN generator. To apply the transformation to extrapolation distribution X, activations are extracted from the internal layer computed by the encoder and cascaded through the decoder without further training. This turns an autoencoder into a generative model by freezing training and applying transformations exclusively on inference. Training an autoencoder with transformed neuron activations allows the network to learn to undo these transformations. By freezing training and applying transformations exclusively on inference, the autoencoder becomes a generative model. Neuron editing can model the intrinsic variation in data X unsupervised, providing more information compared to GANs. GANs are difficult to train due to oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse. GANs are notoriously tricky to train due to oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse. Mode collapse occurs when the discriminator is unable to detect differences in variability between real and fake examples, leading to the generator producing the same point for most inputs. This results in the generator favoring ellipsoid output instead of capturing the complex and natural variability of the real data. Neuron editing avoids the struggles of GANs in detecting differences in real and fake distributions, focusing on learning an unsupervised model of the data space with an autoencoder. It isolates the variation in neuron activations to generate convincing entire distributions of the post-transformation output. Neuron editing, unlike GANs, learns an unsupervised model with an autoencoder to isolate variation in neuron activations for generating different distributions. It is akin to word2vec embeddings in NLP, transforming entire distributions instead of single points. Neuron editing is a method that transforms entire distributions using an autoencoder to isolate variations in neuron activations. It is compared to various generating methods like regularized autoencoder, GANs, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN. The models used different layers and activations, with the image experiment using convolutional layers and the other models using fully connected layers. Regularization penalized differences in distributions of source and target using maximal mean discrepancy. Image experiment used convolutional layers with stride-two filters, while other models used fully connected layers. Training included minibatches of size 100, adam optimizer, and learning rate of 0.001. Motivational experiment on CelebA dataset involved transforming black-haired individuals to blond-haired individuals using a generative model. The text discusses the limitations of using generative models to transform images of people with black hair to blond hair. The models struggle to generalize to out-of-sample data, as shown in an experiment on male individuals with black hair being transformed to blond hair and then applied to females with black hair. The text discusses the limitations of using generative models to transform images of people with black hair to blond hair. The models struggle to generalize to out-of-sample data, as shown in an experiment on male individuals with black hair being transformed to blond hair and then applied to females with black hair. The GAN models have difficulty accurately recreating the input, especially in the hair color, due to artifacts and training complications. This highlights the benefits of stable training methods like autoencoders for tasks like neuron editing. Neuron editing is demonstrated as a solution to the limitations of generative models in transforming images, particularly in changing hair color. The complex transformation is simplified in the neuron space, allowing for applications like batch correction to address technical artifacts in data measurement. Batch correction is a common issue in biological experimental data caused by technical artifacts, leading to differences in datasets. Addressing batch effects is a goal of many new models, including deep learning methods. One method to tackle this issue is to measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation. One method to address batch effects in biological experimental data is to repeatedly measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation. This approach aims to remove any variation induced by the measurement process, allowing for a more accurate comparison between samples. The dataset investigated comes from a mass cytometry experiment measuring protein levels in cells from individuals infected with dengue virus. The data includes 35 dimensions with varying observations in Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2. Technical artifacts and biological differences between the samples create variation, with one batch effect observed in artificially low readings of the protein InfG in Control1. The dataset from a mass cytometry experiment measures protein levels in cells from individuals infected with dengue virus. There are technical artifacts and biological differences between the samples, with one batch effect observed in artificially low readings of the protein InfG in Control1. The model aims to identify and compensate for this variation without losing other true biological differences in Sample1, such as higher values of the protein CCR6. The GANs did not account for cells with high CCR6, leading to all cells being mapped to the same values of CCR6 and InfG. The GANs failed to account for cells with high CCR6, resulting in all cells being mapped to the same values of CCR6 and InfG. This issue was not resolved by the ResnetGAN, as it only encourages the production of output similar to the target distribution, which in this case is not desired. The ResnetGAN does not address the issue of cells with high CCR6, as it focuses on producing output similar to the target distribution. It learns residuals that create more ellipsoid data instead of preserving the original distribution's variation. In contrast, the regularized autoencoder reverses transformations in its latent space, resulting in unchanged data. Neuron editing separates controls and incorporates this variation, removing batch effects while preserving other variations. Neuron editing decomposes variability into control separation, removing batch effects while preserving real variation. It accurately transforms proteins globally and maintains intra-sample variation. PCA embedding shows transformations for Control1, Control2, Sample1, and post-transformation Sample1. In a PCA embedding, the transformation from Control1 to Control2 mirrors the one applied to Sample1, preserving intra-sample variation. The variation between controls accurately corresponds to the variation introduced by neuron editing in the sample, reflecting reasonable transformations. Additionally, biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is analyzed. The dataset analyzed includes cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Neuron editing corrects batch effects in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 under four treatments. Neuron editing corrects batch effects in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 under four treatments: no treatment (basal), BEZ-235 (Bez), Dasatinib (Das), and both Bez and Das (Bez+Das). Measurements from mass cytometry on 41 dimensions show characteristic effects of applying Das, such as a decrease in p4EBP1. In a study on batch effects correction in IFNg, Neuron editing accurately models the effects of applying Das, showing a decrease in p4EBP1 without introducing vertical changes. Regularized autoencoder does not alter output, while GAN models introduce vertical shifts and lose original variation within the dataset. The GAN models fail to accurately predict the real combination, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variation within the dataset. Despite residual connections, the ResnetGAN still struggles with the same issues as other models, unable to replicate even two-dimensional slices of the target data. Neuron editing in ResnetGAN better predicts transformation across all dimensions compared to traditional GANs. It accurately captures the principle direction and magnitude of transformation while preserving variation in the real data. The GANs struggle to replicate target data slices, indicating a lack of appropriate learning. Neuron editing in ResnetGAN accurately predicts transformation across all dimensions and better preserves variation in real data. The GAN generates data with less variance than exists in almost all dimensions. The approach of neuron editing addresses a data-transformation problem inspired by biological experimental settings, where treatment effects need to be applied to the entire dataset based on a subset of observed data. Neuron editing, a novel approach introduced here, utilizes autoencoder latent layers to apply treatment effects to the entire dataset based on a subset of observed data. By editing neurons in internal layers, realistic transformations of image data are achieved, predicting synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. This method learns complex data transformations in a hidden layer's non-linear dimensionality reduced space. Performing edits on neurons in internal layers results in more realistic transformations of image data and predicts synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. Learning complex data transformations in the non-linear dimensionality reduced space of a hidden layer is feasible, allowing for interactions between the edit and other context information during decoding. Future work could involve training parallel encoders with the same decoder or training to generate conditionally."
