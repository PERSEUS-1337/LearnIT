The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine the validity and amounts of claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq. In deciding claims, the Commission applies applicable substantive law, international law, principles of justice, and equity. Priority is given to non-commercial claims of U.S. Armed Forces members related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or the 1987 attack on the USS Stark. The United States Commission is responsible for deciding non-commercial claims related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or the 1987 attack on the USS Stark by U.S. Armed Forces members. The International Claims Settlement Act applies to these claims, with certain exceptions. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of claims. Proceeds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated by the President between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for the payment of claims, subject to limitations. The President determines allocation of funds between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for US Government claims, limited by the ratio of certified claims to total claims. The term \"certified claims of the United States Government\" refers to claims determined by the Secretary of State to be valid and outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission, with their amount certified under procedures established by the President. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Reimbursement for administrative expenses will be deducted from the Iraq Claims Fund. Payments will be made accordingly. The United States Commission certifies awards under section 2, with payments made from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. This includes a $10,000 payment or the principal amount of the award, additional payments for claims with priority, and ratable payments towards unpaid balances of awards. Payments from the Iraq Claims Fund are made in ratable proportions towards unpaid balances of awards, followed by pro rata payments for accrued interest. Any remaining funds in the fund after all awards are paid will be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. Unsatisfied claims are not extinguished by payments made under this Act. After full payment of awards from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the US Treasury. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. The Executive agency can transfer records to the United States Commission for adjudicating claims under this Act. The statute of limitations and unused funds will be addressed accordingly. The statute of limitations for certified awards under this Act is one year after the publication of a notice in the Federal Register. The notice will detail the unpaid claims and awardee names after a 9-year period. Unused funds will be disposed of after a 2-year period. After 9 years, a notice will be published detailing unpaid claims and awardee names. Within 2 years of this publication, any remaining balance in the Iraq Claims Fund will be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts if not used for additional payments. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\""
