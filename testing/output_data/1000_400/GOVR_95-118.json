    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by ERISA in 1974 to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, maintaining separate reserve funds for each program. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering about 37 million participants. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million participants. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Most workers receive full pension benefits, but 49% of participants in terminated multiemployer plans have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors. The Secretary of Labor chairs the board, with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury as other members. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval. An Advisory Committee advises PBGC on various issues. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval. ERISA also establishes a seven-member Advisory Committee to advise PBGC on various issues. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act made changes to PBGC's governance structure, including setting the Director's term at five years and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate within PBGC. The PBGC Director serves a five-year term, can be removed by the President or board of directors, and the Board must meet at least four times a year. A Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate is established within PBGC to liaise with participants and sponsors. PBGC is self-supporting, funded by premiums from private-sector employers, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded companies. The PBGC relies on premiums set by Congress, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded companies for revenue. Private-sector pension plan sponsors pay various premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate per-participant premiums and additional premiums based on plan underfunding. Terminated pension plans in certain situations also pay per-participant premiums per year. Pension plans pay premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate per-participant premiums and additional premiums based on underfunding. For 2019, single-employer plans pay an annual flat-rate premium of $80 per participant, with underfunded plans paying an additional premium of $43 for each $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits. Terminated plans also pay per-participant premiums for three years post-termination. In addition to the flat-rate premium, sponsors of underfunded single-employer DB pension plans pay an annual premium of $43 for each $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits, with a per-participant limit of $541. Terminating single-employer plans pay a premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years. Multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet IRC qualification requirements. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not covered. In 2019, sponsors of multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet IRC qualification requirements, while DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured. Qualified pension plans receive tax benefits under IRC Section 401, with employer contributions being tax-deductible and not taxable income to participants. Income from the plan is taxed as ordinary income when received by participants. Pension plans must meet IRC qualification requirements to receive tax benefits, with employer contributions being tax-deductible and not taxable income to participants. When participants receive income from the plan, it is taxed as ordinary income. Certain pension plans are excluded from PBGC insurance coverage, including governmental plans, church plans, and plans with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC's insurance coverage excludes certain pension plans like governmental, church, and plans with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC operates separate reserve funds for single-employer and multiemployer programs, with assets not interchangeable between them. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes trustee of terminated underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC does not. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded DB pension plans, placing assets in a trust fund for participants to receive benefits. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent pension plans without becoming the trustee. Single-employer plans can be terminated voluntarily, with notification to participants and PBGC, or involuntarily if the sponsor cannot meet obligations. Companies may end pension plans voluntarily if assets cover benefits. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan in either a standard or distress termination. PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor is unable to fund its pension obligations. A company may voluntarily end its pension plan if the plan's assets are sufficient to cover benefit liabilities. PBGC's role in termination is to confirm requirements have been met, and it does not pay benefits to participants. Benefit liabilities include all benefits earned by participants, vested and nonvested, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Assets must cover benefit liabilities for termination to occur. Benefit liabilities for terminated pension plans include vested and nonvested benefits, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Assets must cover these liabilities for distribution to plan participants. Excess assets may be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to a nondeductible excise tax of 20%. The employer may recover excess assets through an asset reversion, subject to a nondeductible excise tax. If a plan terminates in distress, PBGC takes over as trustee and pays benefits using plan assets and recovered assets. In distress or involuntary termination, the plan goes into PBGC receivership. PBGC becomes the trustee, takes control of plan assets, and pays benefit liabilities using recovered assets and its revolving funds. If plan assets are insufficient, the employer can only terminate the plan under specific distress termination criteria. The employer can only terminate the plan under specific distress termination criteria, which include bankruptcy filings, court approval, PBGC determination of debt payment necessity, or PBGC determination to avoid financial difficulties. The distress termination criteria for terminating a pension plan include bankruptcy court approval, PBGC determination of debt payment necessity, and PBGC determination to avoid financial difficulties. These requirements were added by SEPPAA in 1986 and modified by subsequent acts to ensure employer responsibility for underfunded plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received a large distribution, or if PBGC expects unreasonable losses. This ensures employer responsibility for underfunded plans. PBGC may terminate a plan if it does not meet funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has an owner with large distribution, or if PBGC expects unreasonable losses. Federal court can also order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid financial deterioration. Table 2 shows terminations by single-employer DB pension plans since 1974, with PBGC becoming trustee in 4,769 cases. Since 1974, PBGC has become trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans due to terminations. Most terminations result in standard terminations, but in distress or involuntary terminations, the plan's sponsor and controlled group members are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. The shortfall is the difference between the plan's liabilities and assets at termination. Following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group members are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. This liability is measured as the plan's liabilities minus assets at termination. The obligation is payable in cash or negotiable securities to PBGC, with failure to pay potentially resulting in a lien on the employer's property. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC may not have the authority to create a lien. Upon demand by PBGC, a lien on the property of the contributing employer's controlled group may be triggered. In cases of distress termination, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited if the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were vested on the date of plan termination, within limits set by Congress. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were vested on the date of plan termination, within limits set by Congress. Guaranteed benefits include nonforfeitable retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits. Monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, while contingent benefits are only guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before plan termination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that were vested on the date of plan termination, including nonforfeitable retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits. Monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, while contingent benefits are only guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before plan termination. The maximum pension guarantee for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019 is $67,295 a year, adjusted annually for national wage growth. Pension Plans ERISA sets a maximum on the individual benefit amount that PBGC can guarantee, with the maximum pension guarantee being $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019. This amount is adjusted annually and varies based on the age at which the participant begins receiving benefits. The PBGC's annual maximum benefit for retirees increases if they start receiving benefits after age 65. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before age 65 is 7% for the first 5 years, 4% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the following 10 years. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, depending on the type of benefit and survivor's benefits. The PBGC guarantees basic benefits for retirees starting at age 65, with reductions for benefits paid before age 65. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans receive full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits are reduced. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule. In a study released in 2008, PBGC indicated that over 80% of recipients in single-employer plans receive full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits are reduced. Assets of terminated plans are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. PBGC also pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits to participants based on a ratio of assets recovered from the employer. PBGC pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on a ratio of assets recovered from the employer. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency, rather than plan termination. A plan is insolvent when its available resources are not sufficient to pay the plan benefits for the plan year in question. PBGC may provide loans to multiemployer plans when their available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits for the upcoming plan year. These loans are rarely repaid, and if the plan recovers, repayment must begin on reasonable terms. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance from PBGC. PBGC provides loans to multiemployer plans when resources are insufficient to pay benefits. Repayment must start on reasonable terms. Only one plan has repaid assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits for multiemployer plans, with a different ceiling. Benefits are determined by a flat rate multiplied by years of service. The benefit guarantee limit is tied to this formula. For 30 years of service, the limit is $12,870. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving assistance get their full benefit. PBGC estimated in 2015 that 79% of participants in multiemployer plans that receive financial assistance received their full benefit. However, in plans that may need financial assistance in the future, only 49% of participants would receive their full benefit payment. Among ongoing plans, the average benefit is almost twice as large as the average benefit in terminated plans, suggesting that a larger percentage of participants in plans that receive PBGC financial assistance in the future are likely to see benefit reductions. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds, which contain plan assets, premiums, and returns on investments. PBGC's main assets are the trust fund and revolving funds, which contain plan assets, premiums, and returns on investments. The main liabilities include future benefit payments and financial assistance to insolvent plans. PBGC has had a deficit since FY2002 due to large plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines. PBGC has had a deficit since FY2002, mainly due to large plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines. By FY2018, the single-employer program showed a surplus for the first time since FY2001, partly due to increased premiums. The multiemployer program had a surplus from FY1982 to FY2002 but has reported deficits since then. PBGC projects that the multiemployer program may become insolvent by FY2025, with a less than 1% chance of remaining solvent in FY2026. PBGC reported deficits each year since FY2002. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025 with less than a 1% chance of solvency in FY2026. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. Among retiree payees, the average monthly benefit was $606, and among beneficiary payees, it was $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment in FY2015, with an average amount of $2,054. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The program had previously shown a surplus in FY1996, peaking at $9.7 billion in FY2000. Approximately 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment in FY2015, with an average amount of $2,054. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment and premium income. Financial assistance was provided to 78 multiemployer plans, benefiting approximately 62,300 participants in FY2018. The financial condition of the multiemployer insurance program worsened from FY2013 to FY2018, with a deficit increasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. Financial assistance was provided to 78 multiemployer plans, benefiting approximately 62,300 participants in FY2018. In FY2014, the deficit was $65.1 billion, increasing due to insolvency of multiemployer pension plans. PBGC's budget includes premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, trust fund assets, and revolving funds. Transfers of assets to the trust fund are nonbudgetary. The PBGC's budget includes premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, trust fund assets, and returns on investments in U.S. Treasury securities. When PBGC becomes trustee of a single-employer pension plan, assets are transferred to a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The trust fund investments totaled $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018. ERISA authorized the creation of seven revolving funds for PBGC, although only three have been used. The current investment policy for PBGC's trust fund allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income assets, totaling $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018. Three revolving funds, funded by premiums and trust fund transfers, hold assets of $33.2 billion invested in U.S. Treasury securities. PBGC transfers funds from the trust fund to revolving funds to pay participants' benefits. Revolving funds hold $33.2 billion in U.S. Treasury securities. Increases in premiums are criticized for offsetting federal spending. In its FY2017 Projections Report, PBGC estimated its financial condition over the next 10 years, projecting a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. The report indicated that the multiemployer program is likely to run out of money in FY2025. Some stakeholders criticize PBGC premium increases for offsetting federal spending and potentially discouraging employers from maintaining their DB pension plans. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years, with the program likely emerging from deficit by FY2018. However, the multiemployer program is projected to run out of money by FY2025, with a 90% chance of insolvency before then and a 99% chance by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans. The multiemployer program's exposure to future financial assistance is estimated at $53.8 billion, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee participants. Premium levels may be insufficient to provide continued financial assistance to insolvent plans. The PBGC's multiemployer program faces a probable exposure of $53.8 billion in future financial assistance, potentially exhausting its ability to guarantee participants' benefits. Premium levels may not be enough to sustain financial assistance to insolvent plans, leading to possible benefit reductions to ensure sustainability through premium collections only. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to participants as a measure to prevent insolvency. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to participants to prevent insolvency, potentially improving PBGC's financial condition. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 addresses concerns by creating a new joint. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to improve the solvency of pension plans and the PBGC. The committee did not release recommendations by the deadline. Historical data on premium levels is provided in Table A-1 for single-employer programs and Table A-2 for multiemployer programs. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans did not release recommendations by the deadline. Historical data on premium levels is provided in Table A-1 for single-employer programs and Table A-2 for multiemployer programs."
