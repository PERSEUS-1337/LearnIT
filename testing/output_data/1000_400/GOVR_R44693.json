    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons including the birth or care of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or the employee's own health condition. It also allows up to 26 workweeks of leave for the care of a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. The FMLA provides up to 26 workweeks of leave for the care of a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. To be eligible, an employee must work for a covered employer, have 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to leave, work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and have worked for the employer for 12 months. Private-sector employers are covered if they had 50 or more employees for 20 weeks in the current or last calendar year. The FMLA covers employees who work for employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the worksite and have worked for the employer for 12 months. Private-sector employers must have had 50 or more employees for 20 weeks in the current or last calendar year to be covered. Public agencies are covered regardless of staffing levels, but employees must still meet the worksite coverage requirement. The FMLA has been amended multiple times since 1993. The FMLA has been amended multiple times since its passage in 1993, including amendments to cover legislative branch employees, create military family leave entitlement, and modify airline flight crew eligibility requirements. Bills in the 114th Congress proposed new entitlements, expanded permissible leave categories, and modified employee eligibility requirements. Eligible employees are entitled to 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Some proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to amend the FMLA by creating new qualifying uses of leave, expanding existing leave categories, and modifying employee eligibility requirements. One bill, H.R. 5518, would have provided up to 24 hours of leave per year for parental involvement and family wellness activities. H.R. 5518 and H.R. 5535 proposed new entitlements for parental involvement and family wellness leave, allowing eligible employees to attend school conferences or activities and address medical care needs for themselves or family members. H.R. 5535 would provide eligible employees with up to 48 hours of leave per year to attend school conferences or activities for their child or grandchild, with a 7-day notice requirement. This is different from FMLA leave, which is used for other family care needs. The 7-day notice requirement for FMLA leave is shorter than the 30-day notice required for certain situations. The 114th Congress considered expanding FMLA leave for new categories like bereavement and domestic needs. The 114th Congress considered proposals to expand FMLA leave for new categories like bereavement, domestic violence, family involvement, and medical needs related to service-connected disabilities for veterans. Bills introduced would have allowed employees to use FMLA leave for the death of a close family member, including a son or daughter. S. 1302 / H.R. 2260 and S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlements for the death of a son or daughter, parent, or sibling. S. 473 also included provisions for addressing domestic violence and family involvement in school activities. S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlements for family involvement in school activities and addressing domestic violence. Employees could use family involvement leave for school-related activities or medical appointments for family members, totaling up to 24 hours in a 12-month period. H.R. 5165 and other proposals aimed to expand FMLA leave entitlements for family involvement purposes, including hospital care for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Various proposals sought to broaden employees' options for using FMLA leave by expanding relationships or amending definitions. Several proposals aimed to expand FMLA leave entitlements for family involvement purposes, including care for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30% or higher. This includes expanding the set of relationships for which an employee may use family leave and amending definitions related to the current entitlement. Employees can currently use FMLA leave to assist or provide care to family members such as a new son or daughter, a child under 18 years of age, or a child over 18 years old with a disability. Leave for a family member's serious health condition can be taken for the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent. Military exigency leave is also included. The FMLA allows leave for caregiving purposes for a variety of family members, including a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin. Proposed expansions aim to include more family members for caregiving leave. Proposed legislative proposals aim to expand FMLA leave for caregiving purposes to include new family members such as the child of a domestic partner, adult children, grandchildren, and adult grandchildren. Proposed legislative proposals seek to broaden FMLA leave eligibility to cover new family members like adult children, grandchildren, and adult grandchildren, as well as domestic partners, parent-in-laws, grandparents, and siblings. H.R. 5519 and H.R. 5701 proposed adding new family members like domestic partners, adult children, parent-in-laws, grandparents, and siblings to FMLA leave eligibility. S. 473 also suggested including domestic partners, adult children, parent-in-laws, grandchildren, and siblings for military exigency and caregiver leave. The 114th Congress considered legislation to expand FMLA leave eligibility by adding new family members such as domestic partners, adult children, parent-in-laws, grandparents, and siblings.

The proposed bills in the 114th Congress aimed to amend the FMLA to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation as a serious health condition, without automatically qualifying it as such. The determination of a serious health condition is typically made on a case-by-case basis. The 114th Congress considered proposals to amend FMLA eligibility requirements for employees seeking leave, including recovery from surgery related to organ donation. S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 clarified that recovery alone does not constitute a serious health condition, maintaining the need to meet statutory tests for inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. Key requirements for FMLA eligibility include working for a covered employer, having 1,250 hours of service in the past 12 months, working for the employer for 12 months, and being at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles.

H.R. 5518 aimed to reduce the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite from 50 to 15, while H.R. 5496 proposed to remove the 1,250 hours of service requirement and include part-time and full-time employees as eligible. The bill proposed new eligibility requirements for certain veterans with service-connected disabilities, allowing them to access FMLA-protected leave without meeting the standard 12 months and 1,250 hours of employment requirement. The bill proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities to access FMLA-protected leave based on their disability rating. Veterans with a 30%-50% disability rating would need 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked, while those with a 60% or higher rating would need 6 months of employment and 625 hours worked to use leave for medical care related to their disability. Employees with service-connected disabilities rated at 30% or higher must provide certification from a VA medical provider or approved non-VA facility to use FMLA leave for medical needs. Veterans with a disability rating of 60% or higher require 6 months of employment and 625 hours worked, while those with a 30%-50% rating need 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked to access FMLA-protected leave for their disability. The bill proposed that veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30% or higher could use leave for medical care related to their disability if employed for a certain period and hours. Veterans with a 30%-50% disability rating needed 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked, while those with a 60% or higher rating needed 6 months of employment. The bill allows veterans with service-connected disabilities to use leave for medical care if employed for a specific period and hours. Those with a 30%-50% disability rating need 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked, while those with a 60% or higher rating need 6 months of employment. Veterans with a 30% or higher disability rating at retirement must provide certification from the Department of Defense. This separate eligibility requirement allows veterans to access FMLA leave for medical needs sooner than the standard 12-month requirement. S. 3444 would have created a separate hours-of-service requirement for educational support professionals (ESP) in public schools or institutions of higher education. An ESP is defined as an employee providing instructional or non-instructional support. This bill aimed to adjust the hours-of-service requirement for veterans with service-connected disabilities, allowing them to access FMLA leave sooner. The bill S. 3444 proposed a separate hours-of-service requirement for educational support professionals (ESP) in public schools or institutions of higher education. An ESP would be eligible for leave if they worked an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of the total monthly hours expected for their job description in the previous 12 months. The Secretary of Labor could establish separate rules for calculating leave entitlement for ESPs without changing the entitlement size."
