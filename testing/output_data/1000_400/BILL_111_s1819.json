    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Civil Rights Center and Museum Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress acknowledges the significance of the Greensboro sit-in of 1960, which sparked nonviolent protests against segregation across the US. Over 70,000 people participated in similar demonstrations by 1961 in over 60 cities. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, located at the site of the original sit-in, serves as an educational facility and archive. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, located at the site of the original sit-in, will open on February 1, 2010, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the sit-in movement. It will serve as an archival center and teaching facility exploring the international struggle for civil and human rights. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $1 silver coins in commemoration of the opening of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins minted under this Act will have a design emblematic of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, with specific inscriptions and values. The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with relevant parties and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at the United States Mint at West Point, New York. The Secretary may mint coins only during the calendar year beginning on January 1, 2010. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount on sale prices. SEC. 7 of the Act states that all sales of coins will include a $10 surcharge per coin. The surcharges received will be paid to the International Civil Rights Center and Museum for program development and research. The Comptroller General of the United States has the right to audit the Museum's expenditures related to these payments."
