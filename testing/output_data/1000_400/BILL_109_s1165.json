The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and are purchasing the land to protect the endangered species and improve Refuge management. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service entered into a contract to purchase land from the estate of James Campbell to protect endangered species habitat and improve Refuge management. The estate's land on the Kahuku Coast features diverse habitats for threatened and endangered species like Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, and waterfowl. The land of the estate of James Campbell on the Kahuku Coast features diverse habitats promoting biological diversity for threatened and endangered species, including Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide increased opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses such as observation, photography, and environmental education. Acquisition of the land will help protect these habitats, which are increasingly rare on the Hawaiian islands due to coastal development. Expanding the Refuge by acquiring the land described will create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts and prevent flood damage in Kahuku town. The Act defines key terms such as Director, Refuge, and Secretary. The expansion of the Refuge aims to acquire land to create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts and prevent flood damage in Kahuku town.

The Secretary has the authority to make minor boundary modifications to achieve conservation goals or facilitate property acquisition. The map will be available for inspection at a designated office of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The map depicting the expansion of the Refuge, adding 1,100 acres, will be available for inspection at a designated office of the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
