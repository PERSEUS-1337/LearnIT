    "content": "The federal K-12 education assistance legislation, starting from the IASA in 1994 to the NCLB in 2001, focused on granting flexibility to grantees. The NCLB expanded existing flexibility authorities and introduced new ones. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, with updates on major developments and impacts. \"Flexibility\" refers to the authority to waive federal program requirements, including restrictions on the use of federal aid. The report outlines authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, allowing waivers of federal program requirements and restrictions on the use of federal aid. This flexibility includes provisions for consolidation of programs, transfer of funds, and waiving specified requirements to broaden the use of federal assistance. The report discusses flexibility in federal K-12 education programs, allowing for consolidation of programs, fund transfers, and waivers of requirements to broaden the use of federal aid. This flexibility applies to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) but not the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The report focuses on federal K-12 education programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), excluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). It discusses program requirements, flexibility authorities, and potential amendments to the ESEA by the 110th Congress. The report will be regularly updated to reflect legislative developments. The report discusses federal K-12 education program requirements and special flexibility authorities under the ESEA. It analyzes concerns from grantees and issues related to waiving requirements. The report analyzes federal K-12 education program requirements, including accountability requirements that can be waived for states and LEAs under special flexibility authorities. These requirements ensure federal funds are used appropriately, with specific criteria for eligibility, fund allocation, and outcomes, while allowing flexibility in instructional methods and grade levels. Federal K-12 education programs have specific requirements for eligibility, fund allocation, and outcomes, while allowing flexibility in instructional methods and grade levels. These programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. Federal K-12 education programs are categorized based on their focus, such as student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, or subject areas like math or science. These programs are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs due to their targeted nature, with some falling under a block grant program like the Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a \"block grant\" program due to its broad range of activities. Federal requirements and guidance are provided to state and local recipients of federal aid, with a distinction between \"requirements\" that must be met by grantees as a matter of law. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a \"block grant\" program with federal requirements and guidance for state and local recipients. Grantees must meet requirements as a matter of law, derived from authorizing statutes or regulations, especially for complex issues where statutory guidance is insufficient. An example is ESEA Title I-A requirements on curriculum content and pupil performance standards. The Department of Education (ED) prioritizes specific actions for grantees, especially in cases where statutory guidance is lacking, such as ESEA Title I-A requirements on curriculum and assessments. While authorizing statutes may require ED to publish regulations on certain issues, non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided through extensive Q&A or \"Dear Colleague\" letters. Grantees are not legally obligated to follow this guidance. \"Non-regulatory policy guidance\" in education may come in the form of Q&A or \"Dear Colleague\" letters from the U.S. Secretary of Education. Grantees are not required to follow this guidance, but they often treat it as equivalent to regulations to avoid challenges in using federal aid. Grantees may view non-regulatory guidance as equivalent to regulations, leading to fewer challenges in using federal aid. \"Competitive priorities\" set by ED for grant programs give preferential consideration to applicants meeting certain criteria, increasing their chances of receiving support. The Department of Education sets \"competitive priorities\" for grant programs to give preferential consideration to applicants meeting specific criteria, increasing their chances of receiving support. These priorities are not regulations but are typically published in the Federal Register. There has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all, relying on guidance in the statute instead. In 1994, there has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal elementary and secondary education programs. Some programs have no regulations at all, relying on guidance in the statute. For programs with regulations, such as ESEA Title I-A, they are generally briefer and address fewer issues than before the early 1990s. For example, regulations for ESEA Title I-A after 1994 focused on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. The trend since the early 1990s has been towards less extensive regulations for federal education programs. Regulations for programs like ESEA Title I-A have become more minimalist, focusing on key issues such as standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. The Department of Education aims to regulate only when necessary, providing nonregulatory guidance instead of extensive regulations. The Department of Education aims to regulate only when absolutely necessary, providing nonregulatory guidance instead of extensive regulations for federal K-12 education assistance programs. This guidance informs schools, parents, and other parties about the flexibility available under the statute to meet program goals. Federal K-12 education assistance program requirements focus on accountability for appropriate use of federal aid funds, ensuring funds are used effectively to improve educational opportunities. Target and outcome accountability are key forms of accountability in these programs. The accountability requirements for federal K-12 education assistance programs include target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability to ensure funds are used appropriately and effectively to improve student achievement and educational quality. These requirements aim to focus resources on high-need pupil groups and prevent the supplanting of state or local funds. Federal aid funds must be a net increase for eligible pupils, not replacing state or local funds. Requirements include targeting high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses, enhancing parental participation, setting staff qualifications, reporting program impact, meeting student achievement goals, and evaluating instructional effectiveness. The federal aid funds must be a net increase for eligible pupils and not replace state or local funds. Requirements include targeting high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses, enhancing parental participation, setting staff qualifications, reporting program impact, meeting student achievement goals, and evaluating instructional effectiveness. Grantees that violate regulations may have to repay funds or be prohibited from receiving further grants, although sanctions are rarely imposed. General requirements apply to all recipients of federal education assistance. In some cases, authorizing statutes provide limited sanctions for states or LEAs failing to meet requirements. General requirements apply to all recipients of federal education assistance, including regulations on civil rights and student privacy. LEAs in federal child nutrition programs must comply with various related requirements, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income pupils. Regulations applicable to educational programs include civil rights and student privacy. LEAs in federal child nutrition programs must provide free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income pupils. Other federal regulations may also apply to LEAs and schools as employers. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in areas such as grade levels and instructional techniques. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in areas such as grade levels and instructional techniques, with wide latitude in the use of federal education assistance. Complaints about specific program requirements often focus on prohibitions against commingling funds under different federal programs. Complaints about ESEA and related program-specific requirements often focus on prohibitions against commingling funds, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability under NCLB. These requirements aim to establish fiscal accountability. The requirements for ESEA and related programs focus on targeting aid to specific pupils or schools, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability under NCLB to establish fiscal accountability and address the needs of students with the greatest poverty. The eligibility thresholds for flexibility in federal funds aim to target aid to high-need pupil groups, such as disadvantaged and LEP pupils, while outcome accountability requirements under NCLB focus on improving education services and shifting the focus to better outcomes. However, these requirements may be seen as inflexible from a state or local perspective, especially in low enrollment LEAs receiving small grants from various federal programs. The categorical approach of larger ED programs may lead to unintended effects like fragmentation of services. The categorical approach of larger ED programs may have unintended effects in low enrollment LEAs, leading to fragmentation of services and inefficient resource use. This can result in partial needs being addressed instead of a more coherent focus on the whole child's instructional program. Additionally, pupils may be instructed in separate settings, which may not be the most effective technique. The traditional federal categorical approach criticized for fragmented instruction and focusing on resources rather than improving outcomes for pupils, leading to difficulties in implementing programs in states with varying policies. Problems may stem from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations or strict interpretations at the state or local level. Some problems in implementing federal programs in states and LEAs stem from misunderstandings of requirements or strict interpretations at the state or local level, leading to complaints about constraints on the use of federal funds. State and local education officials sometimes complain about constraints on the use of federal funds, including difficulties in obtaining current and concise information on federal requirements. LEA staff often feel limited in flexibility due to information gaps. The GAO report found that LEA staff struggle to obtain accurate information on federal requirements, leading to limited flexibility in their responses. Staff also express concerns about the costs and challenges associated with meeting administrative responsibilities under federal education programs. LEA staff face challenges in meeting administrative responsibilities under federal education programs, including required reports and timelines. Waivers are available for certain federal K-12 program requirements, with varying limitations and accountability measures. Authorities like Ed-Flex and Secretarial case-by-case offer different waiver processes and accountability standards. Some federal K-12 programs offer waivers for administrative responsibilities, with different processes and accountability standards. Five types of special flexibility, including Ed-Flex and Secretarial case-by-case waivers, provide school-level flexibility in fund usage under federal programs. The Innovative Programs block grant provides funding flexibility for small, rural LEAs. Ed-Flex allows SEAs to waive requirements for LEAs or schools under selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized in 1994, Ed-Flex was expanded to 12 states in FY1996. The Ed-Flex program allows SEAs to waive requirements for LEAs or schools under selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized in 1994 for up to six states, it was expanded to 12 states in FY1996 and later modified to remove the cap on participating states. In 2006, legislation was enacted to extend Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. The Ed-Flex program, initially authorized in 1994, was expanded to 12 states by 2006. Legislation in 2006 extended Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority for ED to grant it to additional states expired in FY2004. The recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) ensured that all 10 states with Ed-Flex authority as of September 30, 2004, retain that authority. The recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) extended Ed-Flex authority for 10 states until reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. States must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, and monitor performance of waived entities. No new states have been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, and monitor performance of waived entities. Federal programs affected by Ed-Flex include ESEA Titles: I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, III-B-4, and IV-A-1. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain administrative requirements for various education programs under ESEA, including Title I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, III-B-4, and IV-A-1, as well as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. This flexibility extends to state-administered programs and allows for waivers of cross-cutting administrative requirements of GEPA and EDGAR. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain administrative requirements for education programs under ESEA. This includes state-administered programs and waivers of cross-cutting administrative requirements of GEPA and EDGAR. Some requirements related to fiscal accountability and equitable participation by private school pupils cannot be waived. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain administrative requirements for education programs under ESEA, including fiscal accountability, equitable participation by private school pupils, parental involvement, fund allocation, school selection requirements, and civil rights requirements. LEAs or schools requesting waivers in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA, providing necessary information. SEAs may not waive requirements applicable to themselves. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA for waivers, providing required information. SEAs cannot waive their own requirements. Local waivers may be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers, including effects on student performance. States must submit annual reports on waivers granted, including effects on student performance. ED is required to make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The 2001 report lacked information on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and programmatic impacts, focusing only on new authority in P.L. 106-25. The 2001 report on Ed-Flex waivers lacked information on states' use of authority and program impacts. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. Waivers can be granted to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Secretary of Education, with Title IX, Part D of the ESEA being the most utilized provision. The U.S. Secretary of Education can grant waivers to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis, primarily focusing on Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. This provision allows for the waiver of most requirements associated with ESEA programs, with specific goals and measurement methods required for waiver requests. The U.S. Secretary of Education can grant waivers to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis under ESEA Title IX-D, with specific goals and measurement methods required for waiver requests. Certain requirements, such as prohibitions on using funds for religious worship or instruction, sex education, and charter school eligibility, cannot be waived. The U.S. Secretary of Education can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D, with specific goals and measurement methods required for waiver requests. Certain prohibitions on fund use for religious worship, sex education, and charter school eligibility cannot be waived. Waivers granted may not exceed four years, but can be extended if they contribute to improved student achievement. The Secretary of Education can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D for up to four years, with the possibility of extension if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if pupil performance does not justify continuation or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish a notice of waiver decisions in the Federal Register. The Department of Education failed to publish notices for several years but eventually released a list of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D. A total of 197 waivers were granted between 2002 and 2006, with most being administrative cost limitations or extensions of fund obligation periods. Some waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while others allowed states to participate in a pilot program for adequate yearly progress. Between 2002 and 2006, the Department of Education granted a total of 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D. Most waivers were for administrative cost limitations or extending fund obligation periods. Some waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while others allowed states to participate in a pilot program for adequate yearly progress. Additionally, waivers were granted for Indian education under ESEA Title VII, Part A, and for various other ESEA program requirements. LEAs identified as needing improvement can act as SES providers. 10 \"general programmatic waivers\" allowed exceptions to ESEA Title I-A requirements for fiscal accountability or school selection and allocation. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on waiver effects and effectiveness starting in FY2002. A separate waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program, with no limitations on types of requirements that may be waived. The PCS waiver authority under ESEA Section 5204(e) allows for waivers of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education has administrative authority, with the exception of requirements related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. This authority is used infrequently and for limited purposes. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can use federal funds for schoolwide programs, offering flexibility in fund usage across various education programs. These programs aim to improve services for all students, exempting them from certain regulations if they align with program goals and intended beneficiaries. Schoolwide programs for schools with 40% or more low-income students aim to improve services for all pupils, exempting them from certain regulations if they align with program goals and intended beneficiaries. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other federal and non-federal funds, with flexibility in fund usage authorized for IDEA requirements. The federal program funds for schoolwide programs must supplement, not supplant, other funds. Commingling or flexibility in fund usage is allowed for IDEA requirements, but all programmatic requirements must still be met. The schoolwide program authority primarily applies to Title I-A programs, which focus on groups of pupils with specific educational needs. The ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, combining them with state and local funds without separate accounting, provides significant flexibility compared to traditional targeted assistance programs. Schoolwide programs have few additional requirements and have grown rapidly in recent years, serving a large majority of Title I-A pupils. The Title I-A program allows funds to be used to serve the lowest achieving pupils in a school through schoolwide programs. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB. This change has led to a rapid growth in the number of schoolwide programs, with a large majority of Title I-A pupils now being served by them. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families, leading to a rapid increase in the number of these programs. This change aims to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils in high poverty schools, rather than just the lowest-achieving individuals. The NCLB has reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income pupils, impacting high poverty schools. There is little evidence on the achievement effects of this expansion, and flexibility allows rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) supports rural and/or small high poverty LEAs. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs with specific criteria to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. LEAs meeting certain attendance and location requirements can combine funds from various programs including teacher training, technology, safe schools, and innovative programs. Small, rural LEAs with a population density of fewer than 10 persons per square mile and all schools classified as rural can combine or transfer funds from ESEA programs for teacher training, technology, safe schools, and innovative programs. This flexibility is granted due to the small size of grants received by these LEAs, which are often too small to support effective separate programs. Small, rural LEAs with low population density can combine or transfer funds from ESEA programs for various educational activities due to the small grant sizes they receive. This flexibility allows for more effective use of funds compared to separate programs. Small, rural LEAs can transfer funds from ESEA programs for educational activities under the \"REAP Flex\" authority, which allows for more effective fund utilization. This authority applies to 100% of funds and includes programs like ESEA Titles III and IV-B. Participation in REAP Flex is widespread, with approximately 4,781 eligible LEAs, of which an estimated 51% are participating. Small, rural LEAs can transfer funds from ESEA programs under the \"REAP Flex\" authority, allowing for more effective fund utilization. Approximately 4,781 LEAs are eligible, with 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority. Funds are often transferred from Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A for school improvement activities due to small formula allocations. Small, rural LEAs can transfer funds from ESEA programs under the \"REAP Flex\" authority, allowing for more effective fund utilization. This flexibility is particularly useful for rural LEAs with small formula allocations, enabling them to fund substantial school improvement activities. There is confusion at the LEA level between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, provides special flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is a block grant program in K-12 education that offers states and LEAs flexibility in using federal aid funds. It covers a wide range of educational activities and student types, consolidating previous categorical programs for greater flexibility. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is a block grant program in K-12 education that offers states and LEAs flexibility in using federal aid funds. Funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17, with a majority going to LEAs using state-developed formulas. Title V-A funds are allocated by SEAs to LEAs based on state-developed formulas, considering enrollment of pupils in public and private schools. Adjustments are made to provide increased grants per pupil to LEAs with high-cost pupils, including those from economically disadvantaged families. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received under this program for FY2002 to LEAs. The amount of funds suballocated to LEAs varies based on the program's funding level and whether the state receives the minimum grant amount. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received under the program for FY2002 to LEAs. Additionally, states can retain up to 15% of the funds for administrative costs, with the rest used for specified programs and services. States can retain up to 15% of funds for administrative costs, with the remainder used for specified programs and services including pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, school choice options, repair and renovation, and education reform programs. LEAs can use their funds for various innovative assistance programs. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for a variety of innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, same gender schools, school nurses, education reform projects, and programs to improve academic achievement. This flexibility in fund usage categorizes Title V-A as a block grant. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for various innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, school nurses, and education reform projects. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating over 40 federal K-12 education programs. This flexibility in fund usage categorizes Title V-A as a block grant. The Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) consolidated over 40 federal K-12 education programs into Chapter 2. The block grant reduced the number of federal education programs initially, but new categorical programs were authorized later. A study found that 58% of LEAs used Title V-A funds for instructional materials. The Title V-A funds were used by 58% of LEAs for instructional materials, 39% for educational technology, and 34% for targeted academic services. Large LEAs used the funds for teacher professional development and school improvement. The resources were not often targeted at high-need pupils or schools, with decisions influenced by long-term plans and school priorities. Appropriations for Title V-A have decreased over time. The Title V-A program's funding has declined significantly over the years, from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 provided zero funds for Title V-A, indicating a possible termination of the program. The lack of advocacy for increased funding has contributed to this trend, despite its popularity among education officials. The Title V-A program's funding has declined significantly over the years, with limited advocacy for increased funding leading to its possible termination. Despite being popular among education officials, the program lacks targeted funding and evidence of improved educational outcomes, resulting in a shift towards alternative funding sources like REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. Title V-A program's funding decline may lead to its termination as the only funding source. Limited data on its impact reduces funding incentives. NCLB amendments require states to show how Title V-A improves student achievement. SEAs and LEAs can increase funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. The NCLB allows SEAs and LEAs to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions for flexibility are also available, but their impact is marginal compared to the funding transfer authority. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, including consolidated SEA or LEA applications and funds consolidation for administrative convenience. These authorities are currently provided in Parts B and C of ESEA Title IX. The NCLB Act of 2001 introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing LEAs to transfer funds among specified programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can also transfer funds. The NCLB Act of 2001 introduced flexibility for LEAs to transfer funds among specified ESEA programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer up to 30% of their grants to address the failure. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds, except for administrative funds, among specified programs. States under Title I-A can transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs, excluding funds for state administration and funds required to suballocate to LEAs. The total appropriations for the programs subject to this authority amount to approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008. The process is simple and does not require specific approval, but LEAs must modify their plans and inform their SEA of any transfers. In FY2008, LEAs can transfer up to 50% of approximately $3.5 billion in appropriations for four programs without specific approval. Funds can be shifted to a wide range of purposes, including the Innovative Programs block grant. However, all program requirements still apply to transferred funds, and funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years. In FY2008, LEAs can transfer up to 50% of $3.5 billion in appropriations for four programs without specific approval. Program requirements still apply to transferred funds, and funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with approximately 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. The confusion at the LEA level between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, along with conflicting reports on the use of Transferability, led to LEAs mostly moving funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. Transferability was used to offset reductions in formula grants under Title I-A and V-A, target resources on schools failing to meet standards, and provide flexibility in fund usage. Many LEAs used Transferability to offset reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, target resources on underperforming schools, and provide flexibility in fund usage. Reasons for not participating included lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, and insufficient funding levels. Up to seven states may consolidate all their funds under the new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act. Under a new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act, up to seven states may consolidate all their state administration and activity funds under various education programs. This \"State-Flex\" authority allows for flexibility in fund usage for any purpose authorized under ESEA programs. Under the State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act, up to seven states can consolidate their education program funds, allowing flexibility in fund usage for any purpose authorized under ESEA programs. States must meet AYP requirements to maintain this authority for five years, with the option for renewal if all requirements are met. Each state must enter into local performance agreements with 4 to 10 LEAs. The State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate education program funds for flexibility in fund usage. States must meet AYP requirements to maintain this authority for five years, with the option for renewal if all requirements are met. Selected states must enter into local performance agreements with 4 to 10 LEAs, aligning fund usage with state's purposes. The State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows states to consolidate education program funds for flexibility in fund usage. Participating states must align fund usage with state purposes, and up to 80 LEAs can participate in the Local-Flex authority. Florida was granted State-Flex authority but withdrew before implementation, so no state has participated in the program yet. No state has ever participated in the State-Flex program, as Florida withdrew before implementation. Under the Local-Flex authority, up to 80 LEAs can consolidate funds for various educational programs and use them for authorized purposes. LEAs can use up to 4% of the funds for administration, and the authority is granted for five years, contingent on meeting state AYP requirements. LEAs can consolidate funds from Title IV-A-1 and Title V-A programs for authorized purposes, with a 4% limit for administration. The authority is granted for five years, contingent on meeting state AYP requirements. Renewal is possible if goals are met, but certain requirements like civil rights and fiscal accountability cannot be waived. Under the state and local flexibility demonstration programs, certain requirements such as civil rights, fiscal accountability, and equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers cannot be waived. Participating states and LEAs must report annually on the use of consolidated funds. Seattle, Washington, is the only LEA to have participated in the Local-Flex program, but its eligibility was temporarily suspended for failing to make AYP. Seattle has applied for a new agreement. Seattle, Washington is the only LEA to have participated in the Local-Flex program, but its eligibility was temporarily suspended for failing to make AYP. Despite a series of competitions for State-Flex and Local-Flex authority, there has been little interest from states and LEAs. Only one LEA has participated in Local-Flex, and no states in State-Flex. Barriers to participation include additional responsibilities with few clear benefits. The Local-Flex program had limited participation, with only one LEA, Seattle, Washington, involved. Barriers to participation included additional responsibilities with few clear benefits. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex began in 2004, offering preference in future grant competitions for participants. On March 18, 2004, ED announced a new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex programs in the Federal Register. Participants would receive preference in future grant competitions due to their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement. State-Flex and Local-Flex allow for broad use of funds authorized under ESEA. State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer flexibility in using ESEA funds for improving teacher quality and academic achievement. Participation is limited to a few states and LEAs, but interest has been low despite multiple invitations to compete. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer limited flexibility for a few states and LEAs to use ESEA funds. Despite multiple invitations, interest has been low. State-Flex authority allows states to use funds for other purposes but still requires meeting administrative responsibilities. The share of funds for state administration is small, especially for the largest affected program. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs provide limited flexibility for states and LEAs to use ESEA funds. States are responsible for meeting administrative responsibilities under each program, with a small share of funds allocated for state administration. The share of funds for state administration varies across programs, with the largest program having the smallest share. Participating states have influence over the use of funds consolidated by LEAs with local performance agreements. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs provide limited flexibility for states and LEAs to use ESEA funds. Participating LEAs in the state demonstration program may have diminished flexibility as their use of funds must align with state use and state authority over Title V-A funds. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex with earlier flexibility authorities in H.R. 1 shows differences in provisions. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer limited flexibility for states and LEAs to use ESEA funds. Comparing them with earlier flexibility authorities in H.R. 1 shows differences in provisions. The final provisions are similar to the House version of H.R. 1, authorizing local flexibility demonstrations in up to 100 LEAs. The Senate version had a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which sparked debate during the legislative process. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a flexibility/performance agreement authority that was not included in the final legislation. It would have provided greater flexibility than the State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. The scope allowed for 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority proposed during the 106th Congress was more limited than previous consolidation proposals. It allowed for 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states, with similar program requirements but a broader range of ESEA programs and higher funding levels. The performance agreement authority proposed during the 106th Congress involved higher funding levels and a broader range of ESEA programs, allowing for reallocation of funds among LEAs targeting concentrations of poor children. The Senate version of H.R. 1 requires states and LEAs to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount, ensuring achievement gains are not due to random variations in pupil scores. State-Flex does not allow for reallocation of funds among LEAs, unlike the proposed performance agreement authority from the 106th Congress. The AYP standards must be significantly large to avoid being attributed to random variations in pupil achievement scores. This report discusses cross-cutting issues related to flexibility in federal aid funding for states and LEAs, allowing them to prioritize their own needs over federal priorities. The flexibility authorities for federal aid funding allow states and LEAs to prioritize their own needs over federal priorities by waiving certain program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. Under the Transferability authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and Title I-A schoolwide programs, states and LEAs can waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. These flexibility authorities, especially those from the NCLB, offer increased attention to outcome accountability requirements applicable to all participating states and LEAs. Around 12-16% of LEAs have utilized the Transferability authority, while interest in other flexibility authorities has been limited. The NCLB has introduced increased accountability and flexibility in the ESEA and federal programs. Transferability is utilized by 12-16% of LEAs, while other flexibility authorities like State-Flex and Local-Flex have limited interest. REAP Flex is widely used by small, rural LEAs. Reporting on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement is required, but specific impacts are not well-documented. Common characteristics and cross-cutting issues of flexibility authorities are discussed. The current flexibility authorities have limitations in addressing the primary concerns of states and LEAs regarding federal fund usage and administrative burdens. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is broad but limited to schools with slightly above average low-income pupil rates. The specific impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement is not well-documented. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is limited to schools with slightly above average low-income pupil rates. The Secretarial case-by-case waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. States and LEAs can exercise fund Transferability authority but are limited to transferring 50% of funds received. Rural LEA flexibility authority is also mentioned. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. States and LEAs can transfer up to 50% of funds received but must still meet program requirements. Rural LEA flexibility authority is limited to low-enrollment LEAs. State-Flex authority is limited to seven states. Local-Flex authority is available in a maximum of 80 LEAs. Participation in these authorities is low due to limited flexibility. Certain requirements cannot be waived under these authorities. The Ed-Flex authority allows for waivers in a limited number of LEAs and State-Flex states, with low participation rates due to limited flexibility. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards, cannot be waived. The flexibility authorities do not include Title I-A and do not allow for reallocation of funds among LEAs. The Ed-Flex authority allows for waivers in a limited number of LEAs and State-Flex states, with low participation rates due to limited flexibility. However, the flexibility authorities do not include Title I-A and do not allow for reallocation of funds among LEAs. The 1999 GAO report found that the current flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, such as requirements under IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental regulations. Some SEA staff believe Ed-Flex is of limited value due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived. The GAO report highlights varying opinions among SEA staff regarding the usefulness of Ed-Flex authority. Some states see it as encouraging innovation and flexibility, while others find it of limited value due to the few programs that can be waived. These new authorities have been adopted during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements, particularly in programs like ESEA Title I-A. The special authorities described in the curr_chunk provide additional flexibility in federal education programs, but their impact may be relatively marginal compared to the increased flexibility already seen in programs like ESEA Title I-A. These authorities have been adopted during a period of greater flexibility in federal program requirements, especially in schoolwide programs, consolidating programs related to teachers and educational technology. The special authorities described in the curr_chunk offer flexibility in federal education programs, but their impact may be limited compared to existing flexibility in programs like ESEA Title I-A. Limited information is available on the use of these new flexibilities, with waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation or reform. Some requirements frequently waived in the past have been eliminated or made less restrictive for all states and LEAs by the NCLB. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used for a growth model pilot to determine AYP, a modification widely supported. Recent study shows REAP Flex and Transferability were mainly used to move funds from Title II-A and Title IV-A. Recent studies show that flexibility authorities like REAP Flex and Transferability are often used to move funds between different ESEA titles, such as Title II-A and Title IV-A, to compensate for reductions in formula grants and target resources more effectively. LEAs use these authorities to address schools failing to meet progress standards or to utilize funds with greater flexibility. In the pre-NCLB era, similar flexibility authorities were commonly used in the mid- to late-1990s. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers, Ed-Flex, and other flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements related to ESEA Title I-A and V-A, targeting resources on schools failing to meet progress standards or using funds with flexibility. This included waiving thresholds for schoolwide program eligibility, targeting funds on schools with high numbers of low-income students, deadlines for standards and assessments, and limitations on funds for teacher recruitment and training programs. In the pre-NCLB era, flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements related to ESEA Title I-A and V-A, targeting resources on schools failing to meet progress standards or using funds with flexibility. This included waiving thresholds for schoolwide program eligibility, targeting funds on schools with high numbers of low-income students, deadlines for standards and assessments, and limitations on funds for teacher recruitment and training programs. Schools with low percentages of low-income students may not be suitable for schoolwide programs under Title I-A due to limited impact and potential dispersion of funds away from high-poverty schools. There is no clear evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs in improving education for disadvantaged students. The use of waivers in Title I-A programs can disperse funds away from high-poverty schools, impacting the education of disadvantaged pupils. Waivers may delay meeting accountability requirements, affecting the effectiveness of federal education programs. LEAs and states often request waivers to focus on specific requirements, such as teacher hiring in early grades. The use of waivers in federal education programs, such as CSR and Eisenhower, allowed LEAs and states to request exemptions from specific requirements, like teacher hiring in early grades and limits on fund usage. These waivers were often requested to adapt to local conditions. The NCLB changed the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income students nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were merged into a more flexible ESEA Title II program. Few waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB. The ESEA Title II program consolidated the CSR and Eisenhower programs to support teacher and principal recruitment and training. Limited information is available on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement. Anecdotal information suggests that the achievement effects of waivers granted under the Ed-Flex authority are not well-documented. The information reported by the original 12 Ed-Flex states on waivers granted and their impact was of limited value. No reports have been published on the actual purposes of waivers or their effects under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. Anecdotal information on achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a limited number of LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. Supporters of special flexibility authorities often point to broader evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems. Supporters of special flexibility authorities often cite evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems. A 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex highlighted three major ways in which Ed-Flex authority supports standards-based reform: facilitating program coordination and planning, streamlining program administration, and optimizing resource use to implement standards-based approaches. Ed-Flex allows states to streamline program administration by reducing paperwork and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement. Limited data on the effectiveness of special flexibility authorities raises questions about their impact on pupil outcomes. The effectiveness of special flexibility authorities in improving pupil achievement outcomes is questioned due to limited data availability for analysis. The lack of information dissemination by ED makes it challenging to evaluate the benefits and impact of waivers and other special authorities granted to states, LEAs, or schools. The limited dissemination of information by the Department of Education (ED) regarding the use of waivers and special authorities makes it difficult to assess their impact on pupil achievement. It raises questions about whether outcome accountability requirements associated with these flexibilities adequately replace other forms of accountability measures. The outcome accountability requirements associated with special flexibility authorities may not fully replace other forms of accountability measures. These requirements include goals set by states and LEAs, as well as meeting state-established AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. Some programs lack a direct link between flexibility authority and outcome accountability. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority differed in clarity and specificity of outcome goals. Five states had set no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers, with only one state linking outcome objectives to affected entities. The GAO study found that Ed-Flex states varied in setting outcome goals for waivers, with limited oversight from the ED. Only one state had specific outcome objectives linked to affected entities, while others lacked clarity in objectives. This lack of accountability may hinder substantial outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements. The current flexibility authorities do not require additional outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements for participating LEAs and states. Instead, they emphasize consequences for failing to meet generally applicable outcome accountability requirements. This emphasis is significant as states continue to implement AYP and related NCLB requirements. The current flexibility authorities do not require additional outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements for participating LEAs and states. However, those with special flexibility authority would have an additional incentive to meet the requirements to maintain their eligibility, and face additional consequences for failing to do so. This enhancement of outcome accountability requirements may be consistent with the nature of special flexibility authorities described in the report. The current flexibility authorities do not require additional outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements for participating LEAs and states. Those with special flexibility authority would have an additional incentive to meet the requirements to maintain their eligibility and face consequences for failing to do so. This enhancement of outcome accountability requirements may align with the special flexibility authorities described in the report. The provisions take effect in the context of recent legislation, such as the NCLB, which expands outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in the use of federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools. Some proponents argue that no increase in outcome or other accountability requirements is necessary to justify state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds. Some proponents argue that increasing state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds is justified without additional outcome accountability requirements. Critics may argue against granting special flexibility without more accountability. Critics argue against granting special flexibility in education aid funds without additional outcome accountability requirements, as they believe it may not lead to improved pupil outcomes and lacks sufficient accountability provisions."
