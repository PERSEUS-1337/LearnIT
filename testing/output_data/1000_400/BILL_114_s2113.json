    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges by Federal agencies, including paying only for success, setting ambitious goals without predicting the outcome, involving a broader group of people to tackle problems, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. The Congress acknowledges the advantages of using incentive prizes and challenges by Federal agencies, such as involving a broader group of people to tackle problems, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. Granting Federal agencies the authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity, encourage appropriate use, and stimulate broader public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits, including improving the delivery of government services with lower costs. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits such as improving government service delivery with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to federal agency missions, and acquiring data at a greater geographic extent and frequency than conventional methods. Citizen science promotes open government, volunteerism, and enables citizens to gather, analyze, and share data to address community concerns. It accelerates scientific research through group discovery and diverse perspectives, improves science literacy, and provides skills for excelling in STEM fields.

SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" involves individuals and organizations collaborating in various ways in the scientific process, while \"crowdsourcing\" is a method of obtaining services or content by seeking contributions from a group, especially online. The term \"crowdsourcing\" is defined as a method to obtain services, ideas, or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from a group of individuals or organizations, especially from an online community. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the term \"Federal agency\" includes Executive agencies and military departments, but excludes legislative branch agencies. The term \"participant\" refers to individuals or entities volunteering in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. A \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, or detailees of a Federal agency. Federal agencies can utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches to advance their missions. The head of a Federal agency may accept voluntary services from participants, including Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, or detailees of a Federal agency. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, as long as the services are not financially compensated and do not displace any federal employees. The agencies must also advertise and promote these projects to encourage participation. Each Federal agency engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote and encourage broad participation. Agencies can determine the level of consent, registration, or terms of use required from participants on a project-by-project basis. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose various terms to participants in a clear manner. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing for volunteer service terms. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects can obtain consent electronically or in written form from participants. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations, and data collected should be made open and available to the public in machine-readable formats. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must make data collected available to the public in machine-readable formats. Participants must be informed of the expected uses of the data, ownership rights, data availability for public use, and their authorization to publish the data.
