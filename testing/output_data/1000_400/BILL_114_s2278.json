    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act, known as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015,\" defines key terms including \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" \"Federal entity,\" and \"Spectrum Relocation Fund.\" The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms such as \"Spectrum Relocation Fund\" and \"unlicensed operations\" as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms related to spectrum allocation and allotment by the Federal Communications Commission. The Commission must ensure a balance between exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules must be established to achieve this balance and consider allowing unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until commercial use begins. These rules must be included in the service rules of spectrum auctions. The Commission must establish rules within 18 months of the Act's enactment to balance exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Consideration should be given to allowing unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until commercial use begins, with these rules included in the service rules of spectrum auctions. Additionally, the Commission must ensure that reports submitted to Congress reflect the rulemaking required under this section. The National Strategy for Unlicensed Spectrum is outlined in Section 4 of the Act, which requires the Commission to establish rules within 18 months to balance exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. This includes allowing unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until commercial use begins, with these rules incorporated into the service rules of spectrum auctions. Additionally, the Commission must ensure that reports submitted to Congress reflect the rulemaking required under this section. The United States aims to maximize spectrum utility, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. Within a year of this Act's enactment, the Commission, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary, must develop a national strategy for expanding radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations, including identifying bands to be cleared for such use. The Assistant Secretary will develop a national strategy to make more radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for such use and considering spectrum sharing models. The FCC is considering rules for spectrum sharing to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations in various frequency ranges, including underlay operations in allocated spectrum. They are also exploring ways to improve spectrum utilization accuracy. The FCC is exploring ways to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations in spectrum bands and improve spectrum utilization accuracy. They are also examining ways to enhance existing databases and access systems for spectrum sharing and considering harmonizing additional bands for unlicensed operations. A report describing these efforts is required to be submitted to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment. The FCC is required to submit a report to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment, detailing the strategy developed for expanding opportunities for unlicensed operations in spectrum bands and improving spectrum utilization accuracy. The report will also include any recommendations for legislative change and will be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days of this Act's enactment on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations in the report should address costs and solvency of the Spectrum Relocation Fund. The report to Congress must include recommendations on reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs for Federal entities sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed operations, ensuring the Fund's solvency, exploring the possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in Federal spectrum bands without interference, and considering other spectrum sharing techniques for unlicensed operations. The report to Congress must include recommendations on reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs for Federal entities sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed operations, ensuring the Fund's solvency, exploring the possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in Federal spectrum bands without interference, and considering other spectrum sharing techniques for unlicensed operations, including access by radio technologies to Federal spectrum."
