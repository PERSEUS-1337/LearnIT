    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from income tax. This favorable treatment was made permanent in 2006. 529 plans help middle-class families save for college, with 11.83 million accounts nationwide totaling $244.5 billion in assets. The average account size is $20,671. States sponsoring these plans benefit families seeking to offset rising college costs. The latest data shows 11.83 million 529 accounts open nationwide with $244.5 billion in assets. States encourage saving for college with minimum contributions as low as $25 per month. The President's proposed tax on 529 plans may deter usage, leading to increased student debt. The President's fiscal year 2016 Budget proposes taxing future distributions from 529 college savings plans, which could discourage their use and increase student debt. The Act aims to strengthen and modernize 529 plans to better support students. Computer technology and equipment are now permanently allowed as qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. Computer technology and equipment expenses, including computer software and Internet access, are now considered qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. Additionally, distribution aggregation requirements have been eliminated. SEC. 3 eliminates distribution aggregation requirements in Section 529(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by striking subparagraph (D). The amendment applies to distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4 allows for the recontribution of refunded amounts. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days of the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days of the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount, effective for refunds after December 31, 2014. The House of Representatives passed a bill on February 25, 2015, regarding the recontribution of refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days."
