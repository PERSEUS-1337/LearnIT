    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policy emphasizes the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. This includes a competitive grant program for reforms in select programs and reporting requirements for all teacher preparation programs at the state level. Title II-A of the Higher Education Act supports teacher preparation programs through a grant program and accountability measures. The 115th Congress is considering reauthorization bills that would either repeal or amend and extend Title II. Authorization for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but was extended for an additional fiscal year. The 115th Congress is considering reauthorization bills for Title II-A of the Higher Education Act, which supports teacher preparation programs. Authorization for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been extended under various appropriations legislation. Congressional action to reauthorize the HEA may continue, with key issues identified for debate. The report provides a description of current programs and provisions in Title II-A of the Higher Education Act, focusing on teacher preparation programs. It discusses the challenges posed by alternative approaches to traditional teacher preparation and the need for accountability in program quality. The federal effort in supporting teacher preparation has historically focused on traditional programs in higher education institutions (IHEs). The rise of alternative approaches to teacher preparation programs has posed challenges to federal policy, especially regarding program quality accountability. Most U.S. teachers have been trained at IHE programs since the early 20th century, following the transition from normal schools to schools and colleges of education within universities. The growth of teacher preparation programs at universities began with the incorporation of normal schools. The split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines became formalized, emphasizing the importance of both areas for educators. Alternative routes to teacher certification have widened the gap between teaching practice and subject-matter expertise. Teachers in schools of education are now seen as the new leaders in the teaching profession, emphasizing the importance of pedagogy courses and passing related tests. Alternative routes to teacher certification focus on candidates' prior subject knowledge and training for classroom instruction. The Secretary of Education is required to prepare an annual report on teacher preparation in the US, with the most recent data from the 2012-2013 academic year. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 mandated the Secretary of Education to prepare an annual report on teacher preparation in the US. The most recent report, the Tenth Annual Report, includes data for the 2012-2013 academic year. Online data for 2015-2016 shows that 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. This report provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs across the US, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. 70% of the programs were traditional teacher preparation programs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs. 70% of the programs were traditional, while 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Among the 499,800 teacher candidates enrolled, over 89% were in traditional programs, 5% in alternative route programs at IHEs, and nearly 6% in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 89% of teacher candidates were enrolled in traditional programs, 5% in alternative route programs at IHEs, and nearly 6% in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of teacher preparation program completers, with Texas leading in alternative route completers. New York led in traditional program completions. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. New York led in traditional teacher preparation program completion, while Texas led in completers of alternative routes. Traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not have such requirements. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs are online: Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix. The largest traditional teacher preparation programs enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, with Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix being the two largest online programs. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. The most common subject areas of program completion in traditional programs are elementary education, special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The completion rates for alternative teacher preparation programs are 65% at programs based at an IHE and 59% at programs not based at an IHE. For African-American enrollees, the completion rates are 18%, 16%, and 9% respectively. The most common subject areas for program completion in both traditional and alternative programs are elementary education, special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score for teacher assessments is 74.4%, with over 95% of candidates passing the test. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting/accountability provisions for teacher preparation programs. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program, the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, which aims to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers through enhanced preparation and professional development activities. The TQP program supports traditional teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs. The TQP program aims to enhance teacher quality by improving preparation and professional development for prospective and new teachers. It supports traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year programs and teacher residency programs, providing grant funding for school leadership activities. The program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to around two dozen partnerships. Awarded projects include pre-baccalaureate/fifth-year programs, residency programs, and a combination of both. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to around two dozen partnerships. Among awarded projects, 30% are pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, 48% are residency programs, and 23% are a combination of both. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, a school or department of education, and a school or department of arts and sciences. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires partnerships with high-need schools or early childhood education programs, higher education institutions, and arts and sciences departments. Grantees must match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Reforms in teacher preparation programs include curriculum changes, assessment of teaching skills, and implementation of research-based teaching and learning practices. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires partnerships with high-need schools or early childhood education programs and higher education institutions. Reforms in teacher preparation programs involve implementing curriculum changes, assessing teaching skills, using research-based practices, providing clinical education with mentoring, creating induction programs, increasing compensation for qualified educators, offering professional development, and developing recruitment mechanisms. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program focuses on creating high-quality induction programs for new teachers, increasing compensation for early childhood educators with degrees, providing professional development for teachers in high-need schools, recruiting qualified individuals into teaching, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grants support teacher residency programs that prepare teachers for success in high-need schools through rigorous graduate-level coursework and teaching apprenticeships. Teacher residency programs funded by grants aim to prepare teachers for success in high-need schools by offering rigorous coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for professional collaboration. Cohorts receive a living stipend or salary, with a requirement to teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school and subject. Grants also support the development of effective school leadership programs. Teacher residency programs funded by grants aim to prepare teachers for success in high-need schools by offering rigorous coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for professional collaboration. Cohorts receive a living stipend or salary, with a requirement to teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school and subject. Grants also support the development of effective school leadership programs to prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, or other school leaders. Such programs promote strong leadership skills, understanding of teaching and assessment techniques, data-driven evaluation of instruction, resource management for academic improvement, parent and community engagement, and overall school climate conducive to professional development. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to create a school climate conducive to professional development for teachers, improve classroom instruction through teaching and assessment skills, use data to drive teacher and student learning, manage resources to enhance academic achievement, engage parents and community stakeholders, and understand student learning to increase academic success. Grant funds must be used for a yearlong clinical education program, mentoring and induction programs, and recruiting qualified school leaders. Title II of the Higher Education Act holds teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and institutions to report program performance. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to create a conducive school climate for professional development, improve classroom instruction, use data for teacher and student learning, manage resources, engage stakeholders, and enhance academic achievement. Title II of the Higher Education Act requires states and institutions to report on teacher preparation program performance to receive funding. States and institutions must issue report cards to the Department of Education and the public based on Section 205 of the HEA. The Higher Education Act mandates that states and institutions report on teacher preparation program performance. States must evaluate programs based on criteria such as teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Additionally, states are required to identify low-performing programs and report the results to the Department of Education and the public. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs based on criteria like teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Some less common criteria included improving student academic achievement, raising entry standards, and increasing professional development opportunities. 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk programs, while 30 states and jurisdictions have never identified any programs as low-performing. A total of 45 programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk in 2014. In 2014, teacher preparation programs were evaluated for performance, with 45 programs identified as low-performing or at-risk. Legislation such as H.R. 4508 and H.R. 6543 aimed to reform the Higher Education Act, with differing approaches to improving education quality. The Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (H.R. 4508) was approved, making amendments to the Higher Education Act (HEA) including the repeal of Title II provisions. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending Title II provisions such as changes to the TQP program, expansion of accountability provisions for institutions, and changes to accountability for states. The HEA reauthorization bill includes provisions for grantees to receive a second grant, expanded accountability for institutions and states, and the requirement for report cards to be submitted. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II. On March 27, 2017, the President signed a resolution nullifying a congressional disapproval. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II. On March 27, 2017, the President signed a resolution nullifying a congressional disapproval, which would have added new regulations to Title II. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including provisions related to reporting, accountability, and penalties for poor performance. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has discussed HEA reauthorization but has not proposed changes to Title II. Potential considerations for reauthorization include the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, the mix of TQP activities, and the effectiveness of current reporting and accountability measures. Some argue for a more substantial federal role in teacher preparation, stating that the current TQP program mainly supports demonstration projects. Some argue for a more substantial federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities under the TQP program, with traditional teaching routes seeking greater support for program enhancements. Some argue for a more substantial federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. Debate exists over the optimal mix of activities under the TQP program, with traditional teaching routes seeking greater support for program enhancements. Those favoring alternative routes want fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Expansion of federal policy around program quality is also advocated for. Some argue for greater accountability in teacher preparation programs, advocating for program evaluations tied to student performance outcomes. However, others believe federal accountability requirements are unnecessary and burdensome, as current reporting already places a strain on state and local administrators. Less than 3% of programs are identified as low-performing, with many states never identifying a program in this manner."
