    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with only FERS employees receiving employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which applies to private sector retirement plans. ERISA does not apply to CSRS and FERS, which are governmental retirement plans. ERISA protects spouses and former spouses of private-sector plan participants, requiring certain benefits and compliance with qualified domestic relations orders. Consent is needed to name a non-spouse beneficiary in a defined contribution plan. Retirement benefits for federal employees under CSRS and FERS are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code, similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. A QDRO from a state court is required to divide retirement benefits in a divorce. Written consent is needed to name a non-spouse beneficiary in a defined contribution plan. The default form of annuity in such plans must be a joint and survivor annuity. Title 5 of the United States Code (CSRS and FERS) establishes rights for spouses of federal employees similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. Both require written consent for waiving survivor annuity, but differ on when pension payments to former spouses can begin. ERISA allows payments when the participant reaches retirement age, while Title 5 has different criteria. Under ERISA, a court can order pension payments to a former spouse to start when the plan participant reaches retirement age, regardless of whether they have retired. In contrast, Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a federal employee's retirement annuity to a former spouse until the employee has left federal service, is eligible for the annuity, and has applied for it. ERISA also differs from Title 5 in the requirement for spousal consent in naming beneficiaries in defined contribution plans. Under ERISA, a court can order pension payments to a former spouse to start when the plan participant reaches retirement age, regardless of whether they have retired. In contrast, federal regulations allow a participant in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees to name anyone as the plan beneficiary in the event of the participant's death \"without the knowledge or consent of any person, including his or her spouse.\" A state court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation can award a former spouse of a federal employee either a share of the employee's retirement annuity, a survivor annuity, or both types of annuity.

Section 8346 of Title 5 generally exempts CSRS from the proceedings of state courts, but Section 8345 allows a former spouse of a federal employee to be awarded a share of the employee's CSRS retirement annuity in accordance with a state court decree. Section 8345 of Title 5 allows a former spouse of a federal employee to be awarded a share of the employee's CSRS retirement annuity in accordance with a state court decree.
