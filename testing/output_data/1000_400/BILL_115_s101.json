    "content": "The Act titled \"King Cove Road Land Exchange Act\" finds that the land exchange is in the public interest and includes the designation and construction of a road corridor. The Act defines \"Federal land\" as 206 acres within the Refuge and includes 131 acres in the Wilderness for road construction. \"Non-federal land\" refers to 43,093 acres owned by the State. \"Refuge\" means the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in the State. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"non-Federal land\" (43,093 acres owned by the State), \"Refuge\" (Izembek National Wildlife Refuge), \"road corridor\" (designated under section 4(b)(1)), \"Secretary\" (Secretary of the Interior), \"State\" (State of Alaska), and \"Wilderness\" (Izembek Wilderness designated by law). The curr_chunk states that a land exchange is required. The curr_chunk outlines the process for a land exchange between a State and the Secretary, involving conveyance of Federal land for the purpose of designating a road corridor and constructing a gravel road. Valuation and equalization of the exchanged lands are also addressed. The process for a land exchange between a State and the Secretary involves appraisals to determine the value of Federal and non-Federal land, ensuring equality in the exchange. Appraisals must adhere to nationally recognized standards. The appraisals for a land exchange between a State and the Secretary must adhere to nationally recognized standards, including the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. If the final appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land in the exchange, the values must be equalized. If the appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land in a land exchange, the values can be equalized by conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or using a combination of both methods. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land is higher, the surplus can be addressed accordingly. In a land exchange, if the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage of the non-Federal land to be conveyed to equalize the values. The Secretary may also accept a payment in excess of 25 percent of the value of the Federal land conveyed. The Secretary may accept a payment in excess of 25 percent of the value of the Federal land conveyed in a land exchange. Upon completion of the exchange, the boundary of the Wilderness will be modified to exclude the Federal land, and the non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness and administered according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The land exchange must be completed by a deadline. The non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness and administered according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road, including usage, barrier cables, and dimensions, will be in accordance with the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. SEC. 6 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 applies requirements to the road constructed in the road corridor. SEC. 7 states that the exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land, and the construction of the road under this Act, will not require a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
