    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) under the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) buys fuel for all DOD services and agencies in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, initially under the Army-Navy Petroleum Board before becoming part of the Defense Logistics Agency in 1962. The Board fell under the Department of the Interior before transferring to the War Department in 1945 and becoming the Joint Army-Navy Purchasing Agency. In 1962, it became part of the Defense Supply Agency, now known as the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Renamed the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) in 1964, it managed the DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it was re-designated the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded mission to manage energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on lowest cost for various categories including bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, refueling at airports, and post-camp-and-station. DESC typically awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost for various categories including bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, refueling at airports, and post-camp-and-station. DOD's fuel purchases over the current decade (FY2000-FY2008) are summarized, comparing fuel spending to overall DOD spending, prices paid for fuel, quantities purchased, and refining for jet fuel. The report discusses DOD's fuel requirements, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices paid for fuel, quantities purchased, and refining for jet fuel. It also addresses recent legislation and policies aimed at stimulating private sector interest in producing alternative fuels. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying them. High fuel prices have sparked interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no projects have reached commercial operation yet. New legislation aims to prevent federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars on fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas emission reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. Legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations and their responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. Proposed rules mandating greenhouse gas emission reporting may minimally affect refineries. Legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could impact some refinery operations and their responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. DESC's bulk fuel purchases mainly consist of JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army being primary consumers. Total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 purchases peaking in FY2004 and declining since then. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion. JP-8 purchases peaked in FY2004 and have been declining since. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% increase. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% over the same time period. DESC's petroleum product purchases, summarized by volume and total cost, do not necessarily correspond with DOD's actual consumption. DOD may draw fuel down from storage to supplement demand and may replenish fuel stores with purchases. Fuel costs and average prices continued to rise due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of all petroleum products purchased increased from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, a 370% increase. The cost of petroleum products purchased by DESC rose significantly from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. Jet and diesel fuel prices also increased during this period, leading to a higher margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices. The margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices increased as fuel prices rose. DOD responded by purchasing commercial jet fuel at lower prices and increasing purchases of alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel. Outlays represent DOD's actual spending. In FY2000 through FY2007, total defense outlays increased by 200%, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497%, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, with the rest imported. Fuel costs increased by 497% from FY2000 to FY2008, representing 1.2% to 3% of DOD's spending. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, with the rest imported from various countries. Refineries have shifted to heavier sour crudes due to diminishing supply of sweet crudes like West Texas Intermediate. Refineries have shifted to heavier sour crudes like West Texas Intermediate due to diminishing supply of sweet crudes. Crude oil is processed into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel through refining processes like hydrocracking and catalytic cracking. Refineries process residuum from atmospheric distillation into gasoline and middle distillate products using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. They may also produce kerosene/jet fuel and diesel fuel. Specifications for jet fuel are more rigorous than for kerosene. Refineries are set up to run specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process. Sour crudes require desulfurization. Refineries are set up to process specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process. Different types of refineries include topping refineries, hydroskimming refineries, cracking refineries, and coking refineries, each with varying levels of complexity in processing crude oil. Naphtha reforming and sulfur treatment processes are essential in refineries. Hydroskimming refineries run light sweet crude to produce gasoline, while cracking refineries add vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking to process light sour crude for distillates. Coking refineries, on the other hand, use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. The complexity of a refinery is determined by its atmospheric distillation capacity and the proportion of secondary processing units to primary distillation, as measured by the Nelson Complexity Index. Secondary processing units like cracking and coking increase refinery complexity and output volume. The Nelson Complexity Index rates this complexity, with U.S. refineries averaging a complexity index of 10. Gulf Coast refineries with a complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries may upgrade processes due to changes in crude oil supplies. Gulf Coast refineries with a complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries have upgraded processes to handle heavier sour crude oils and meet EPA regulations for ultra-low sulfur diesel by 2010. Petroleum product pipelines transport various fuels in sequence. The EPA regulations limit diesel fuel in the US to 15 ppm sulfur content, termed \"ultra-low sulfur diesel.\" Refiners must produce lower sulfur diesel to prevent contamination during pipeline transport. DOD has shifted to using JP-8 instead of diesel for land-based equipment. The DOD has adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, using JP-8 for land-based equipment to minimize the fuel supply chain length. The Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm. The U.S. Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8 for operations, with sulfur content limited to 3,000 ppm by ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E. Most kerosene has a sulfur content of 400 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 for readiness. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. The EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles under the Clean Air Act. In 2009, they found that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health. A recent proposal would require petroleum refineries to report emissions from refining processes and other sources. Petroleum refineries emit around 205 million metric tons of CO2. The EPA proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, including emissions from petroleum refineries. Refineries emit 205 million metric tons of CO2 annually, representing 3% of US GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations to cap emissions. Proposed bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Recently introduced bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. The bill would cap emissions from refineries and allow trading of emissions permits. The provisions of H.R. 2454 would gradually reduce the cap, forcing industries to either reduce emissions or purchase allowances from others. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation, operating a total of 31 refineries in the United States with a combined crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. These refineries have an average Nelson Complexity Index rating of 10 and two-thirds have the coking capacity for medium sour crude. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141, but the crude oil distillation capacity increased from 17.8 million to 18.6 million barrels per day. The increase in capacity is partly due to a rise in diesel fuel capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day. The median capacity of currently operating refineries is around 80,000 barrels per day, with the majority of refineries above this median making up 85% of U.S. refining capacity. The increase in U.S. refining capacity is attributed to a rise in diesel fuel capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day. Refineries above the median capacity make up 85% of overall U.S. refining capacity. Gulf Coast refineries yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of U.S. net production of jet fuel. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded the U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years. U.S. refineries do not meet all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel, leading DESC to increase purchases of commercial jet fuels. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending on fuel. DESC has increased purchases of commercial jet fuels, such as Jet A, to make up for the lack of U.S. refining capacity meeting DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending on fuel as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. DESC also relies on contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces and installations outside the continental United States. DESC purchases commercial jet fuels like Jet A to compensate for insufficient U.S. refining capacity. They also rely on contracts with foreign suppliers to support forces outside the continental U.S. The authority to procure fuel stems from the Navy's power, as outlined in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229. DESC relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel for DOD customers in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund. This allows for price breaks on large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. DESC purchases fuel for DOD customers in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund, taking advantage of price breaks and providing stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. The terms \"acquisition\" and \"procurement\" are defined by Title 41 and Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137, respectively, governing the Armed Forces acquisition process. The procurement process for acquiring property or services is governed by Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR outlines federal agency acquisition regulations. The Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) in 48 CFR Parts 201-299 is used by the Department of Defense. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. They use economic price adjustment provisions in contracts when general economic factors make future cost estimation unpredictable. Supplies and related services are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions under FAR17.105-1(b) and DFARS 217.170(a) and 217.172(b). DESC has adopted contracting instructions for multiyear contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station services for the period of October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas storage, handling, or distribution with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. Authorized to enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922 with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. Multiyear contracts buy more than one year's requirement without the need for yearly options, while multiple year contracts have a set term. Multiyear contracts allow for cancellation payment if funds are not appropriated by Congress. They differ from multiple year contracts in that they cover more than one year's requirement without yearly options. Authority for multiyear contracts for supplies comes from procurement statutes under 10 U.S.C. 2306b. DOD agencies can use multiyear contracts for supplies under 48 CFR 17.172 to promote national security and achieve cost savings. Multiyear contracts for supplies under 48 CFR 17.172 allow DOD agencies to enter into contracts that promote national security and result in cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. This type of contracting is encouraged to take advantage of lower costs and other objectives. A multiyear contract for supplies can be entered into under 48 CFR 17.105-2 to promote national security and cost savings. The contract cannot exceed $500 million without approval from the Secretary of Defense. DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, with the ability to enter into multi-year contracts. The Secretary also has broad waiver authority over the acquisition of alternative fuels, allowing for waivers on contract formation, terms, and conditions if market conditions affect fuel acquisition. The term \"defined fuel source\" includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) determines contract terms and conditions, including a five-year limit on multi-year contracts that can be waived by the Secretary. DESC bases contract delivery prices on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, without risking jeopardizing sales authority granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e. DESC determines contract terms and conditions, including a five-year limit on multi-year contracts that can be waived by the Secretary. Contract delivery prices are based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government. DESC levels the price of fuel for all DOD's customers and includes a surcharge for its operating costs. Additional costs may be incurred by the operational command for fuel delivery forward. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 addresses hidden costs in fuel pricing. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider hidden costs in fuel logistics, including additional costs for fuel delivery forward. It also mandates a life-cycle cost analysis that includes the fully burdened cost of fuel and appoints a director responsible for overseeing energy requirements for military operations. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 mandates a life-cycle cost analysis that includes the fully burdened cost of fuel. The Act also appoints a director responsible for overseeing energy requirements for military operations. The Department of Defense experienced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade, impacting training and operations. Fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD's spending, affecting budget allocations. The Air Force had to reduce funding for flying hours used to train aircrews due to high fuel costs from military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike the airline industry, DOD's only recourse for increased fuel costs has been to request supplemental appropriations. DOD identified $0.5 billion in the FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Request for baseline fuel cost increases. DOD has sought supplemental appropriations to cover increased costs and supplies, including $0.5 billion in the FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Request for higher fuel costs. To limit vulnerability to fuel price fluctuations, DOD has explored options like fuel hedging, multi-year contracts, and alternative fuels such as commercial Jet A fuel. DESC's business model allows flexibility to meet changing operational needs, using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel price fluctuations. They use hedging strategies to minimize the risk of future jet fuel price increases. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel price fluctuations. They use hedging strategies, such as buying \"futures\" contracts, to minimize the risk of future jet fuel price increases. The Defense Business Board explored ways for DOD to hedge fuel purchases in commercial markets to reduce exposure to price volatility. The Defense Business Board explored ways for DOD to hedge fuel purchases in commercial markets to reduce exposure to price volatility. They considered engaging in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service, utilizing additional oil revenues to offset increasing DOD fuel costs. The Group suggested seeking legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on price changes, but noted the challenge due to Congress already allocating revenues from Outer Continental Shelf leases. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may seek legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on price changes. Interior's revenues come from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, with royalties-in-kind paid in oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR was created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions, holding roughly 70 days of imported supply when filled to capacity. A drawdown under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can involve a sale or exchange of oil. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions. It holds roughly 70 days of imported supply when filled to capacity. A drawdown under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can involve a sale or exchange of oil. President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization during the 1991 Persian Gulf War led to a rapid crude oil price decline. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of the crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR, causing operational issues for some refineries. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of the crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Refineries processing heavy oil would face operational issues if they had to use SPR oil, leading to a substantial reduction in refining throughput. The SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially involving heavy oil, could be compromised. Additionally, the SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not be effective in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption, especially if it involves heavy oil. Refineries processing heavy oil may face operational issues if they have to use SPR oil, limiting the SPR's role in supporting DOD's requirements. As a last resort, DOD may seek alternative or synthetic fuels, but federal agencies are restricted from procuring them unless they meet specific emissions criteria. The DOD may consider alternative or synthetic fuels as a final option, but federal agencies are limited in procuring them unless they meet emissions criteria. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant, but DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. The Air Force has abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant, but DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. Despite declining crude oil prices, the possibility of supply shortages and price spikes remains. DOD is focusing on efficiency and may report on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations to Congress. The refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices could be a concern for Congress. DOD is shifting towards efficiency and may report on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations to Congress. Congress may also be concerned about the refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits and the continued operation of marginally profitable refineries. Congress may worry about potential refinery shutdowns reducing defense fuel suppliers. For more on alternative fuel sources, refer to CRS Report RL34133 and CRS Report RL33359. In the long term, Congress may be concerned about potential refinery shutdowns reducing defense fuel suppliers. Background information on alternative fuel sources, greenhouse gas legislation, and different types of fuels like Avgas and DF2 is available in various CRS reports. Avgas is high octane fuel for light aircraft, DFM is used in ship propulsion, DF2 is for ground vehicles, FSII prevents icing, and FOB is a trade term for delivery of goods on board a vessel. The trade term \"free\" obligates the seller to deliver goods to a specified place for transfer to a carrier. International transportation contracts often use abbreviated terms to specify delivery, payment, risk transfer, and cost responsibilities. Jet A-1 is a kerosene-based turbine fuel for international commercial aviation, with ASTM specification D16555 and NATO designation F-35. Jet A is a similar fuel available in the US with a higher freeze point than Jet A-1. Jet A-1 (D16555) is a kerosene-based turbine fuel for international commercial aviation, with NATO designation F-35. Jet A is a similar fuel with a higher freeze point, mainly available in the United States. Jet B is a distillate used in very cold climates as an alternative to Jet A-1, supplied under Canadian Specification CAN/CGSB 3.23. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with additional additives. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel developed for military aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers, with a higher flash-point than other aviation turbine fuels. It meets U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-5 and British Specification DEF STAN 91-88 AVTAG/FSII. NATO Code is F-40. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with corrosion and icing inhibitors. The Air Force switched to JP-8 in 1996 for safety and combat survivability. It is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, containing less benzene and n-hexane. The Alaska Air Guard still uses JP-4 for cold-climate properties. JP-8, adopted by the Air Force in 1996 for safety and combat survivability, is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4. It contains less benzene and n-hexane, with a stronger smell and oily texture. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Middle Distillate range fuels like kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel are used in military installations. Mogas is the main fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting allows for acquiring known requirements over up to five years. Agency funding for multiyear contracts must adhere to OMB Circulars A-11. Multiyear contracting allows for acquiring known requirements in quantities and total cost not exceeding planned limits for up to five years. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used as a feedstock in gasoline production for catalytic reforming."
