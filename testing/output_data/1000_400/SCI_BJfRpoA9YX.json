    "content": "We propose a generative model to learn image representations that separate object identity from attributes. For example, a person's identity remains the same whether they wear glasses or not. Our approach successfully synthesizes images with and without specific attributes. In this study, a factorization approach is used to learn image representations that separate object identity from attributes. The success of this approach is demonstrated through image attribute manipulation, where the same face is synthesized with and without a chosen attribute. The model achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks, showing that latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs can map latent encoding space to data space effectively. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) learn a mapping from latent encoding space to data space, with the latent space often organized linearly. Directions in latent space correspond to changes in attributes, useful for image synthesis and editing. Semantically meaningful changes can be made by manipulating the latent space. Latent space in generative models allows for image synthesis, editing, and avatar creation by manipulating semantically meaningful changes. Research explores class conditional image synthesis for specific object categories, such as fine-grained subcategories like different dog breeds or celebrities' faces. The research explores latent space generative models for synthesizing images from fine-grained categories like different dog breeds or celebrities' faces. Instead of fine-grain categories, the focus is on image attribute manipulation, aiming to synthesize images with only one element or attribute changed, such as a person's smile in a face synthesis scenario. This differs from synthesizing two different faces, as the goal is to create two similar faces with a single chosen attribute altered. The paper proposes a new model for image attribute manipulation, focusing on synthesizing similar faces with a single chosen attribute changed. The model learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the facial representation. The core contribution is a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to learn a latent representation that factorizes attributes. The new model learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information. Contributions include a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder, extensive quantitative analysis of loss components, competitive classification scores, and successful editing of the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. Latent variable generative model achieves competitive classification scores and successful editing of 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. Discusses distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing. Provides code for experiment reproduction. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow synthesis of novel data samples from latent encodings. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x). The encoder predicts \u00b5 and \u03c3 for a given input x, and a latent sample is drawn from the encoder. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) offer a generative model and an encoding model for image editing in the latent space. New data samples are synthesized by drawing latent samples from a prior distribution and then generating data samples from the decoder. Samples from VAEs are often blurred. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide an alternative to VAEs for generating sharper images. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator trained using convolutional neural networks in a mini-max game to synthesize realistic samples. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) involve a generator and discriminator trained with convolutional neural networks in a mini-max game. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between 'fake' samples from the generator and 'real' samples from the data distribution, while the generator aims to produce samples that confuse the discriminator. The objective function includes the distribution of synthesized samples and a chosen prior distribution like a multivariate Gaussian. The vanilla GAN model lacks a straightforward method to map data samples to latent space, but some variants incorporate an encoder model. The approach presented involves combining a VAE with a GAN to enable faithful reconstruction of data samples. This alternative latent generative model uses the VAE for encoding and decoding, with a discriminator ensuring higher quality output from the decoder. Training adversarial networks on high dimensional data samples remains a challenge despite proposed improvements. The VAE is combined with a GAN to improve data sample reconstruction quality. Various suggestions exist on how to merge VAEs and GANs, but none are tailored for attribute editing. Image synthesis from a VAE or GAN depends on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution. The content discusses how image samples synthesized from a vanilla VAE or GAN depend on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution. Well-trained models will produce samples resembling the training data, which may include images from multiple categories. Vanilla VAEs cannot synthesize samples from a specific category, but conditional VAEs and GANs offer a solution by allowing class-specific data synthesis. Autoencoders can be augmented for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to the encoder and decoder inputs. Autoencoders can be augmented for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to the inputs. Another approach involves the encoder outputting a latent vector and an attribute vector for classification loss minimization. Incorporating attribute information in this way may have drawbacks. Incorporating attribute information in a model for category-conditional image synthesis can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. Modifying the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector may not always result in the intended changes, indicating that information about the attribute is partially contained in the latent vector. This issue has been discussed and addressed to some extent. Incorporating attribute information in category-conditional image synthesis can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. Modifying the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector may not always result in the intended changes, suggesting that information about the attribute is partially contained in the latent vector. To address this issue, a process is proposed to separate the information about the attribute from the latent vector using a mini-max optimization involving the encoder E \u03c6 and an auxiliary network A \u03c8. The proposed process, 'Adversarial Information Factorization', aims to separate attribute information from a latent vector in image synthesis. By using a mini-max optimization involving the encoder E \u03c6 and an auxiliary network A \u03c8, the process aims to ensure that the latent vector \u1e91 does not contain information about the desired attribute y, which should be encoded within the attribute vector \u0177. The proposed method involves training an auxiliary network to predict a desired attribute y from a latent encoding \u1e91, while updating the VAE encoder to output \u1e91 values that prevent accurate prediction. This process aims to separate attribute information from \u1e91, ensuring that \u0177 contains the necessary information to minimize reconstruction loss. The novel approach involves training the VAE encoder to factor out information about the desired attribute y from the latent encoding \u1e91. This is achieved by integrating an adversarial method to separate y from \u1e91, with the help of an auxiliary network A\u03c8. The encoder also functions as a classifier, outputting attribute vector \u0177 along with latent vector \u1e91. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and auxiliary network A\u03c8. The encoder acts as a classifier, outputting attribute vector \u0177 and latent vector \u1e91. Parameters of the decoder are updated using a loss function involving binary cross-entropy. The encoder's parameters can be updated by minimizing a function with additional regularization coefficients. The encoder's parameters can be updated by minimizing a function with additional regularization coefficients, including binary cross-entropy loss. The proposed model involves a VAE with information factorization, split into E z,\u03c6 and E y,\u03c6 for latent encoding and label extraction. The architecture also includes a decoder D \u03b8 and an auxiliary network A \u03c8. The current work introduces an adversarial information factorization model with a VAE core split into E z,\u03c6 and E y,\u03c6 for latent encoding and label extraction. It incorporates a GAN architecture with a discriminator C \u03c7 to classify decoded samples. In contrast, previous work like cVAE-GAN lacks an auxiliary network for information factorization and only predicts a label for the reconstructed image. The current work introduces an auxiliary network, A \u03c8, to factor label information out of the latent space \u1e91 in the cVAE-GAN architecture. The encoder is updated to prevent attribute information from being encoded in \u1e91, resulting in an Information Factorization model. Training is complete when the auxiliary network is unable to predict the true label y from the latent output E z,\u03c6(x) of the encoder. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) is trained using an auxiliary network to prevent attribute information from being encoded in the latent space. Attribute manipulation is achieved by encoding the image, appending the desired attribute label, and passing it through the decoder for synthesis. This approach allows for easy attribute manipulation through 'switch flipping' in the representation space, as demonstrated with quantitative and qualitative results.

Attribute manipulation is achieved by appending the desired attribute label and passing it through the decoder for synthesis, enabling easy 'switch flipping' in the representation space. Quantitative and qualitative results evaluate the model's performance, including an ablation study and facial attribute classification using a DCGAN architecture with residual layers for competitive results. The curr_chunk discusses updates on an ablation study and facial attribute classification using a DCGAN architecture with residual layers to achieve competitive results. The model is qualitatively evaluated for image attribute editing, distinguishing between a naive cVAE-GAN and an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) for training. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of cVAE-GAN models for image attribute manipulation, focusing on reconstruction quality and the proportion of edited images with desired attributes. An independent classifier is trained to classify attributes, and the contributions of each component in the novel function are shown in TAB0. The evaluation of cVAE-GAN models for image attribute manipulation involves training an independent classifier to classify attributes and analyzing the contributions of each component in the novel function. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. Our model demonstrates successful attribute editing, achieving 81.3% accuracy in changing images to 'Not Smiling' and 100% accuracy in changing images to 'Smiling'. The inclusion of a classification loss on reconstructed samples was explored, showing the importance of our proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function for effective attribute editing. The synthesized images are the same for different values of \u0177. The effect of including a classification loss on reconstructed samples was explored, but it did not provide clear benefits in the model. The IcGAN was included in the study, showing similar reconstruction error to the model but performing less well in attribute editing tasks.

The model learns a representation for faces that factors the identity of the person from facial attributes by minimizing mutual information between them. The training procedure encourages putting label information into \u0177 rather than \u1e91, making the model useful for facial attribute classification.

In this section, attribute manipulation is discussed, focusing on the limitations of a cVAE-GAN in editing desired attributes. The need for models that learn a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction quality is highlighted. The need for models that learn a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction quality is highlighted in attribute manipulation. The cVAE-GAN model failed to edit samples for the 'Not Smiling' case, emphasizing the importance of such models. The IFcVAE-GAN model was trained with specific weightings on loss terms and hyper-parameters, achieving good reconstruction quality. The IFcVAE-GAN model was trained with specific weightings on loss terms and hyper-parameters, achieving good reconstruction quality. It was able to synthesize images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute with a 98% success rate, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN model. Our IFcVAE-GAN model outperforms the naive cVAE-GAN in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute, achieving a 98% success rate compared to 22%. This demonstrates the model's ability to change desired attributes while maintaining good reconstruction quality. Our IFcVAE-GAN model outperforms the naive cVAE-GAN in synthesizing images without smiles, achieving a 98% success rate compared to 22%. This showcases the model's capability to manipulate facial attributes while maintaining high reconstruction quality. The IFcVAE-GAN model successfully manipulates facial attributes by factorizing them from identity, using an auxiliary classifier for representation. The IFcVAE-GAN model utilizes an auxiliary classifier to factorize facial attributes from identity, achieving competitive scores on attribute classification tasks. Adversarial training is used to extract attribute label information from the encoded latent representation. Similar techniques are employed by other models like Schmidhuber FORMULA3 and BID16, but with differences in implementation. Our work incorporates adversarial training to factor attribute label information out of the encoded latent representation, similar to other models like Schmidhuber FORMULA3 and BID16. Unlike BID16, our model predicts attribute information and can be used as a classifier. We minimize mutual information between latent representations and labels through adversarial information factorization, different from BID4's approach of predicting mutual information. Our work is most similar to the cVAE-GAN architecture proposed by BID3, which focuses on synthesizing samples of a particular class. Our work, similar to cVAE-GAN proposed by BID3, focuses on synthesizing samples of a particular class. Unlike BID3, we aim to manipulate specific attributes of an image, such as making \"Hathway smiling\" or \"Hathway not smiling\". This requires a different approach to factorization in the latent representation. Additionally, our model learns a classifier for input images simultaneously. Separating categories is simpler as distinct categories result in noticeable image changes. Changing attributes requires targeted changes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. Our model learns a classifier for input images, unlike BID3. BID0 also emphasizes \"identity preservation\" in the latent space through an identity classification loss. BID17 uses a VAE-GAN architecture but does not condition on label information. Our work focuses on attribute editing rather than category conditional image synthesis. Our work focuses on attribute editing in images, highlighting the importance of separating label information from the latent encoding for successful editing. Unlike category conditional image synthesis, attribute editing requires targeted changes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. Our approach in latent space generative models allows for semantically meaningful changes in image space. In this paper, the focus is on attribute editing in images by separating label information from the latent encoding. The approach in latent space generative models enables semantically meaningful changes in image space by simply adjusting a single unit of the encoding. In latent space generative models, attribute editing in images is achieved by changing a single unit of the encoding, allowing for semantically meaningful alterations in image space. This approach differs from image-to-image methods and utilizes factorization in the latent space to enable efficient editing of attributes. In latent space generative models, attribute editing in images is achieved by changing a single unit of the encoding, allowing for semantically meaningful alterations in image space. The \u03b2-VAE objective minimizes mutual information, forcing the model to learn a disentangled representation. A novel supervised factorization of the latent space is proposed, allowing for modification of image elements. This approach was demonstrated on human face images but is generalizable to other objects. The Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN model allows for attribute editing in images without affecting the object's identity. It separates the object's identity from its attributes, enabling accurate and easy attribute editing. The model outperforms pre-existing models in this aspect. The conditional VAE-GAN model encourages attribute information to be factored out of identity representation through adversarial learning. It captures identity accurately and enables easy attribute editing without impacting identity. The model outperforms existing models for category conditional image synthesis and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in facial attribute classification. This approach to learning factored representations for images is a novel and significant contribution to representation learning. Our approach to learning factored representations for images is a novel and important contribution to representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on facial attribute classification. Ablation studies demonstrate the need for L aux loss and show that increased regularization reduces reconstruction quality. There is no significant benefit to using the L class loss. Results show that small amounts of KL regularization are effective. Regularization reduces reconstruction quality, with no significant benefit from using the L class loss. Results without L KL and L gan show that some KL regularization is necessary for good reconstruction. Models without L gan have slightly lower error but produce blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can still accurately edit attributes, although sample visual quality is poor. This highlights the importance of factored representations in the model. In our model, even without L gan or L KL loss, it can accurately edit attributes but with poor sample visual quality. This emphasizes the importance of factored representations. Other models can also learn factored representations from unlabelled data, with DIP-VAE being one of the best for this purpose."
