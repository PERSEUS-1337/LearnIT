For example, payments can be adjusted to reflect higher costs for women compared to men, ensuring insurers are not financially incentivized to enroll one gender over the other. The mechanism for leveling the playing field in risk adjustment involves paying insurers $100 more for women than for men, or $100 less for men than for women, to reflect their different expected health expenditures. Risk adjustment models consider factors like age, geography, health status, and tobacco use, but still do not fully explain variations in healthcare spending. This report also discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage. The report discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, including risk adjustment models that consider factors like age, geography, health status, and tobacco use. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Medicare Parts A and B. Risk-adjusted MA payments are made to private health plans under Medicare Advantage, which offer managed care options for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Health plans receive a capitated monthly payment adjusted for demographics and health status of enrollees. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments but can retain savings if costs are lower. Payments are based on each plan's bid compared to the maximum federal payment for benefits provided. The Medicare Advantage (MA) payment system involves private health plans receiving capitated monthly payments based on their bids compared to the federal payment for benefits provided. Plans can retain savings if costs are lower and are at-risk if costs exceed payments. CMS sets a benchmark for bids, with plans receiving a base rate equal to the benchmark if their bid is above it, and a base rate equal to their bid if it is below the benchmark. Payments are adjusted based on the characteristics of enrolled Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare Advantage (MA) payment system involves private health plans receiving capitated monthly payments based on their bids compared to the federal payment for benefits provided. CMS sets a benchmark for bids, with plans receiving a base rate equal to the benchmark if their bid is above it, and a base rate equal to their bid if it is below the benchmark. Payments are adjusted based on the characteristics of enrolled Medicare beneficiaries, such as age, gender, and health history. The current MA risk adjustment methodology uses demographic and health factors to adjust payments to plans in the following year. The current MA risk adjustment methodology adjusts payments to plans based on demographic factors like age and gender, as well as health history. CMS estimates future healthcare expenditures by considering beneficiary characteristics from the current year, including age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. The payment system incorporates variables like age and disability status, with data on how beneficiaries became eligible for Medicare. The MA risk adjustment methodology adjusts payments based on demographic factors like age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. Health status is determined by diagnosis using ICD-9-CM codes, which denote signs, symptoms, injuries, diseases, and conditions. Physicians submit these codes for Medicare reimbursement. The process of diagnosis for Medicare reimbursement involves using ICD-9-CM codes to categorize signs, symptoms, diseases, and conditions. There are over 13,000 codes that are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories. These categories have a hierarchy where only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy based on clinical severity and cost. The hierarchy of condition categories for Medicare reimbursement dictates that only the most severe manifestation of a disease is coded for payment. This ensures that the most costly form of the disease determines reimbursement. Hierarchical coding in Medicare reimbursement prioritizes the most severe disease manifestation for payment, with 70 HCC codes currently used to predict future Medicare expenditures. Starting in 2012, 87 HCC codes will be utilized. Figure 2 illustrates the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes to HCC codes for reimbursement. In 2012, Medicare will incorporate 87 HCC codes into the reimbursement model. Figure 2 shows how ICD-9-CM codes are converted to HCC codes, with an example of a 76-year-old female's diagnoses. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC, as the hierarchy determines the coding priority. In 2012, Medicare will use 87 HCC codes for reimbursement. ICD-9-CM codes are converted to HCC codes based on hierarchy. Not all diagnoses lead to an HCC, as some conditions are excluded if they are not chronic or short-term. The model aims to predict future expenditures by using the highest code in a related disease category. Unrelated disease categories are additive in the model. The model for predicting future Medicare expenditures uses the highest code in a related disease category, with unrelated categories being additive. A beneficiary's total risk score is calculated by summing individual risk factors based on disease hierarchy. This score is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment. For example, a monthly base rate of $621.67 would result in an annual payment of $11,810 for a beneficiary with a risk score of 1.583. The risk score, based on disease hierarchy, is multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to calculate the risk-adjusted base payment. Interaction effects between multiple conditions can lead to higher costs than just their additive effects. For example, the healthcare costs for an individual with both diabetes and congestive heart failure are higher than expected from adding the costs of each condition separately. The interaction effects between certain diseases and disability can lead to higher healthcare costs than just their additive effects. CMS has incorporated these interactions into the CMS-HCC model, which adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses. The model is a linear regression model that determines the size of adjustments mathematically. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model that adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses. It includes interactions between certain diseases and disability, with expenditure data based on actual claims data for original Medicare Parts A and B. The model's relative risk factors are periodically recalculated using current claims data. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, with risk scores standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, with risk scores standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. Risk scores can be standardized to reflect higher or lower costs, allowing CMS to individualize payments based on health status and demographics. The goal is to adjust payments to reflect the likely costs a plan should incur in treating a similarly situated Medicare beneficiary. The CMS adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, with risk scores standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. New enrollees' rates are based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses. The CMS adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, with risk scores standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. For new enrollees, rates are determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses. Non-new enrollees have their risk scores updated periodically based on data collected from MA plans, transitioning from RAPS to EDPS for more detailed encounter level data. The CMS adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, with risk scores standardized to reflect costs compared to average Medicare beneficiaries. Data from physician claims and hospital facilities are used to update risk scores twice a year. Payments are adjusted based on data from the prior 12-month period, not the current service year. Risk scores for Medicare Advantage plans are adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1, based on data from the prior 12-month period. Errors in demographic and health status information provided to CMS by plans can impact risk-adjusted payments. Demographic data, disability status, and Medicaid eligibility come from administrative files, while health status information is submitted by plans to CMS. Plans are responsible for ensuring accuracy in the health status information to justify risk-adjusted payments. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans to ensure that risk-adjusted payments are supported by medical records. Previously, audits only sought to recover errors in payments for sampled enrollees, but in February 2011, the President's FY2011 budget proposed extrapolating the error rate to the entire plan contract, resulting in estimated savings of $2.27 billion. In February 2012, CMS finalized the payment error calculation methodology for Medicare Advantage plans, allowing for the extrapolation of audit findings to estimate payment errors for the entire contract. This change may lead to plans pushing back more aggressively as CMS aims to recover larger dollar amounts. CMS released the final notice of payment error calculation methodology in February 2012, allowing for the extrapolation of audit findings to estimate payment errors for the entire contract. This may lead to plans pushing back more aggressively as CMS aims to recover larger dollar amounts. Audits are conducted at the contract level, with a three-step process involving sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. CMS uses samples to reduce the burden on plans, with 201 enrollees considered a sufficient sample size. CMS engages in a three-step process for auditing contracts: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. A sample size of 201 enrollees is considered sufficient, drawn from eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an MA contract. Enrollees must meet specific criteria to be included in the sample. Eligible enrollees for auditing MA contracts must meet specific criteria, including continuous enrollment, non-ESRD status, non-hospice care, full Medicare Part B coverage, and diagnosis of risk adjustment conditions. They are divided into three groups for sampling, with a target of 201 enrollees. During the data collection period, eligible enrollees for auditing MA contracts were divided into three groups for sampling. Each group consisted of 67 enrollees randomly drawn based on their risk scores. Sampling weights were constructed to ensure representation of each group. The final group for auditing MA contracts consists of 67 enrollees randomly drawn from eligible enrollees with the lowest risk scores. Sampling weights are used to ensure representation of each group, with enrollee sampling weights used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the population it represents. The MA plan is informed of the audited enrollees and their HCC codes for reproduction and delivery to the CMS contractor. The MA plan is directed to provide evidence from medical records to substantiate HCC codes for audited enrollees. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Once received by the CMS contractor, medical records are reviewed to confirm the diagnosis for risk-adjusted payments. If the diagnosis is substantiated, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Plans can appeal findings and request a review by the CMS Administrator. Payment errors result in either overpayment or underpayment for each enrollee. Underpayments must be found in the initial medical record validating the audited CMS-HCC. The CMS notes that payment errors for each enrollee can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). Underpayments must be supported by the initial medical record validating the audited CMS-HCC. Risk scores are corrected based on supported HCCs, and payments are recalculated for each enrollee. Payment errors are the difference between original and corrected payments, with errors being either positive or negative. The RADV medical record review corrects risk scores and calculates payments for each enrollee. Payment errors, either positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment), are determined based on the difference between original and corrected payments. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is derived by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The total payment error for each sampled enrollee is multiplied by their sampling weight to determine the weighted enrollee payment errors. These errors are then summed to estimate the payment error for the MA contract. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster. This adjuster addresses concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries regarding documentation standards. Figure 4 illustrates the payment error calculation process. The documentation standards used in RADV audits differ from those used in developing the risk adjustment model. The payment error calculation process involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review, identifying errors, weighting each enrollee relative to the plan, and summing the errors. In a hypothetical example, the estimated plan level error is $1,187.50 with a 99% confidence interval. The payment error calculation process involves weighting each enrollee relative to the plan, summing errors for 201 sampled enrollees, and calculating a 99% confidence interval for the estimated plan error. In a hypothetical example, the confidence interval ranges from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50, indicating a certainty of greater than 99% that the error in payment to the plan is at least $1,037.50. If the interval includes $0, the recovery amount would be limited to $0. In a hypothetical example, the confidence interval ranges from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50, indicating a certainty of greater than 99% that the error in payment to the plan is at least $1,037.50. If the 99% confidence interval does not include $0, then the lower bound is adjusted by a fee-for-service adjuster to determine the reimbursement amount to the government. The RADV audit results do not lead to additional payments to MA plans. Recent studies have raised concerns about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. Recent academic studies and preliminary research by MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. The application of the FFS adjuster will not result in additional payments to MA plans. Plans may manipulate enrollment to disproportionately enroll beneficiaries who are below average cost into their plan. Recent academic studies and preliminary research by MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. Plans may manipulate enrollment to disproportionately enroll beneficiaries who are below average cost into their plan, leading to below average expenses while being reimbursed at rates established for average beneficiaries. MedPAC is concerned that some Medicare Advantage plans may disproportionately enroll high-cost individuals but be reimbursed for average cost enrollees. Brown et al. suggest exploring improvements to the CMS risk adjustment model, while being skeptical of its prospects. Some Medicare Advantage plans, like special needs plans and PACE plans, may enroll high-cost individuals but get reimbursed for average cost enrollees. Stakeholders, including the American Academy of Actuaries, have concerns about the audit process and the accuracy of risk adjustment models used by CMS. The AAA is worried that the methodology used to estimate payment errors may not accurately reflect the risk profiles of actual enrollees. The AAA's primary concern is that the Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments was never validated, leading to potential errors in estimating premiums. They argue that the methodology designed for payment errors may not accurately reflect the risk profiles of actual enrollees, creating inconsistency in how the risk adjustment factors are applied. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply those factors only to MA data that are validated, leading to potential payment errors if discrepancies exist in the data used for risk adjustment. The audit process aims to address data inconsistencies in risk adjustment factors, which could lead to payment errors in Medicare Advantage. If lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic, it may result in inadequate payments for diabetic members. This inconsistency may cause systematic underpayment and undermine the risk adjustment system's purpose. The notice of final calculation methodology for Medicare Advantage plans raised concerns about data inconsistencies in risk adjustment factors, potentially leading to payment errors. This could result in inadequate payments for diabetic members and create systematic underpayment, undermining the risk adjustment system's purpose. The Health Practice Council is worried that the modified payment methodology may not accurately reflect the relative risk profile of enrollees in affected MA plans. The Health Practice Council is concerned about potential payment errors in RADV calculations for Medicare Advantage plans. The new payment methodology may not accurately reflect the risk profile of enrollees. A fee-for-service adjustment has been added to address these concerns, but there are still worries about under or overcompensation for plans enrolling sicker or healthier beneficiaries. Plans enrolling sicker or healthier Medicare beneficiaries may be under or overcompensated due to concerns about the accuracy of risk adjustment coefficients. Some plans fear financial risk from RADV audits. The Secretary's approach to addressing methodological concerns in risk adjustment implementation remains uncertain. The history of Part C risk adjustment payments to private plans under Medicare involves various models that have evolved in complexity over time. These models aim to account for the variation in healthcare costs among Medicare beneficiaries. The R2 measure is used to assess how well each model predicts individual beneficiary expenditures. The R2 measure is used to assess how well Medicare private plan payment models predict individual beneficiary expenditures, ranging from $0 for healthy beneficiaries to hundreds of thousands for ill beneficiaries. The models aim to predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics, with the Average Adjusted Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) model having an R2 value. The R2 measure quantifies how well Medicare private plan payment models predict individual beneficiary expenditures based on their characteristics. The AAPCC model has an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of the expenditure variation. Subsequent models have increased this percentage, with the most recent proposed model explaining approximately 12.5% of the variation in expenditures. The AAPCC model, prior to 2000, adjusted private plan payments under Medicare programs for demographic characteristics like age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, and more. These variables explained less than 1% of expenditure variation. The model did not consider health costs or adjust for enrolling very ill beneficiaries. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology that took into account beneficiary health status by no later than January 1, 2000, using the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model. This model considered demographic variables and beneficiary health to determine private plan payments under Medicare programs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by January 1, 2000, using the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model. This model considered beneficiary health status and the worst principal inpatient diagnosis for payment calculations. The PIP-DCG model explained more of the variation in Medicare expenditures than the AAPCC model but had limitations such as not accounting for illnesses with high costs that did not require hospital admission. Additionally, efforts to reduce hospital admissions could lead to lower risk-adjusted payments. The PIP-DCG model, mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, aimed to adjust Medicare plan payments based on beneficiary health status and principal inpatient diagnosis. While it explained more expenditure variation than the AAPCC model, it had limitations like not counting high-cost illnesses not requiring hospital admission. Subsequent legislation maintained a 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method phase-in schedule until 2003 to ease the financial impact on M+C organizations. In 2004, the CMS-HCC model was introduced, incorporating data from various healthcare settings to adjust Medicare payments. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which considers severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. The model explains nearly 10% of expenditure variation and is detailed in the \"Risk Adjustment Under Medicare Advantage\" section. Updates to the CMS-HCC retain the basic structure. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness, multiple diseases, and interactive effects. Updates to the model, such as Version 12 and Version 21, include recalibration with recent diagnosis and expenditure data to better explain variations in Medicare expenditures. The update to Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model increased the predictive power to approximately 12.5% by including updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data. This version underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. Version 21 is set to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
