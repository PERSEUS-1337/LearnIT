    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detection Canine Augmentation Act of 2005\". The Congress recognizes the importance of detection canines in homeland security for detecting explosives, narcotics, concealed humans, and cadavers in various locations where detection technologies are not feasible. There is a shortage of detection canines available to support law enforcement at all levels. Detection canines are crucial for homeland security, detecting items like explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans. There is a shortage of canines available to assist law enforcement, despite Congress authorizing new Border Patrol agents without a corresponding increase in deployed canines. Canines have been deployed to busy airports, but the Transportation Security Administration needs to expand its training program to meet demand. Detection canines are used for homeland security purposes, including detecting explosives, narcotics, and concealed individuals. Canines have been deployed to busy airports, but there is a need to increase the capacity of training programs to deploy them to mass transit systems, urban search and rescue operations, and National Special Security Events. Various agencies like the Bureau of United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Protective Service regularly use detection canines for security purposes. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing on the shortage of trained detection canines for homeland security activities. Various federal agencies and other organizations highlighted the need for more trained canines to secure National Special Security Events and protect federal buildings and sea ports. Increasing the number of trained detection canines is a priority for homeland security activities. The Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines in various agencies by at least 25% in fiscal years 2007 through 2011. This includes Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Increase by at least 25% the number of trained detection canine teams for Coast Guard, Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, and Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure availability in emergencies. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing training facilities efficiently, and explore partnerships with other agencies to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement. The Secretary of Homeland Security must coordinate canine training programs for security missions and explore partnerships with other agencies to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement. A report detailing the Department's plan to consolidate training programs and coordinate with other Federal agencies is required within 120 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. CANINE PROCUREMENT. The Secretary of Homeland Security prioritizes increasing domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism missions. Consultation with other agencies and the Office of Management and Budget is required to consolidate canine procurement and reduce costs."
