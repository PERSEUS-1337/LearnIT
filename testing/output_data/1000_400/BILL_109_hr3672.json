SEC. 3. Reimbursement of states for TANF benefits provided to assist families affected by Hurricane Katrina from other states. Beginning with the enactment of this Act until August 31, 2006, a State qualifies as needy if it has provided short-term, nonrecurring cash benefits to families displaced by Hurricane Katrina from another State declared a disaster area. The Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act applies to families displaced by Hurricane Katrina who have traveled to a State from another State affected by the hurricane. The State must confirm that the family is not receiving cash benefits from any other State-funded program. The total funding to a needy State under this Act cannot exceed the cash benefits provided to the families. The Act allows for funding to needy States affected by Hurricane Katrina, with the total amount not exceeding cash benefits provided to families. No State match is required for payments made under this section. SEC. 4. AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL TANF FUNDS FOR HURRICANE-DAMAGED STATES. Certain States like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are eligible for loans under the Social Security Act until the end of fiscal year 2006. The loans made to these states cannot exceed 20 percent of the State family assistance grant for that year. Additionally, there will be no penalty for these states if they fail to repay the loans. Notwithstanding section 406 of the Social Security Act, States like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are forgiven from repaying loans made under section 403 for fiscal year 2006. No penalties will be imposed for failure to repay the loans or make interest payments. States affected by Hurricane Katrina are allowed to use unspent TANF funds to support needy families without time limits. Families receiving temporary TANF benefits due to the hurricane are not subject to work requirements or time limits. Benefits provided on a short-term, nonrecurring basis under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, during the period that begins with the date of the enactment of this Act and ends with the end of fiscal year 2006, to meet a subsistence need of a family resulting from Hurricane Katrina shall not be considered assistance for purposes of sections 407 and 408(a)(7) of the Social Security Act. Additionally, families affected by Hurricane Katrina receiving temporary TANF benefits are exempt from work requirements and time limits. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will waive TANF penalties for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama due to Hurricane Katrina until the end of fiscal year 2006. All amounts in the Act are designated as emergency requirements. Each amount provided in this Act is designated as an emergency requirement."
