    "content": "Many observers criticized the premature withdrawal of United Nations security forces from Timor-Leste in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta requested the UN to stay for five more years in May 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. In 2008-2009, many displaced civilians returned home after civil unrest. A failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008 by a group led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was killed in the incident. Reinado's group surrendered in April 2008 after he was killed. In 2008, a failed assassination attempt on President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao was led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was killed in the incident. Reinado's group of over 600 former soldiers surrendered in April 2008. Despite improved security in Timor-Leste, concerns remain about the lack of implemented security reforms following the 2006 mutiny by security forces. The joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999. The Timor-Leste government has yet to address the underlying causes of the 2006 mutiny by security forces. A joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999. Concerns arise over government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009. Timor seeks to benefit economically from gas reserves in the Timor Sea, but faces challenges due to political instability and competition with Darwin, Australia. China's involvement in Timor-Leste has also increased. In 2009, Timor-Leste planned to withdraw funds from the Petroleum Fund to gain economic benefits from gas reserves in the Timor Sea. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased, offering assistance with construction and selling power plants and patrol boats. The government created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, focusing on housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and socio-economic development. IDP camps were closed in June 2009 as part of the resettlement and reintegration framework. Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, covering housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and socio-economic development. The last IDP camps were closed in June 2009, with support needed to decommission them. East Timor was under Portuguese colonial control until 1975 when Indonesia invaded, leading to a period of occupation and significant loss of life. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, leading to a period of occupation and significant loss of life. A national referendum in 1999 resulted in 78% of voters choosing independence, sparking retaliation by pro-integrationist militias. In 1999, a referendum in East Timor, supervised by the UN, saw 78% of voters choosing independence. This led to violent retaliation by pro-integrationist militias, resulting in over 1,300 deaths and widespread destruction of infrastructure. A UN peacekeeping mission, INTERFET, led by Australia, was deployed to restore order. In 1999, militias destroyed schools and medical facilities in East Timor. A U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission, INTERFET, led by Australia, was deployed to restore order. Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, became president in 2006 after the resignation of Mari Alkatiri. In 1975, Ramos-Horta left Timor-Leste before Indonesian troops invaded. He represented Fretilin abroad and advocated for Timor-Leste internationally. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996, he became president in 2006 after Mari Alkatiri's resignation. Ramos-Horta survived an assassination attempt in 2008. Xanana Gusmao, the current Prime Minister, led the resistance against Indonesian occupation after being a civil servant under Portuguese rule. Captured in 1992, Gusmao was released in 1999 by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie. Xanana Gusmao, a former civil servant under Portuguese rule, became the leader of the resistance in Timor-Leste after the death of Fretilin commander Nicolau Lobato in 1978. Captured by Indonesian forces in 1992, Gusmao was released in 1999 by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie. He became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002 and later served as prime minister after forming a coalition with smaller parties. Gusmao survived an assassination attempt by Reinado forces in 2008, who led a group of disgruntled security forces causing insecurity in 2006. Gusmao formed a coalition with smaller parties and survived an assassination attempt by Reinado forces in 2008. Alkatiri, a former prime minister, remains Secretary General of Fretilin and has support in the country. Alkatiri, a minority Muslim in Timor-Leste, has a hostile relationship with Gusmao. Fretilin opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. Timor-Leste has a unicameral parliament of 65 members elected in 2007. The relationship between Alkatiri and Gusmao is hostile as Fretilin opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. Timor-Leste has a unicameral parliament of 65 members elected in 2007, which grew out of a Constituent Assembly that drafted a constitution for East Timor in 2002. East Timor formally became independent on May 20, 2002, with Fretilin leading the resistance to Indonesian rule. East Timor formally became independent on May 20, 2002, with Fretilin leading the resistance to Indonesian rule. The new constitution established a parliamentary government with a popularly elected President. Xanana Gusmao headed a coalition government formed in 2007, consisting of four parties. The main opposition party is Fretilin. The Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority (APM) is a four-party coalition in East Timor, with the main opposition party being Fretilin. The parliament faces challenges with members lacking legislative experience and education, using multiple languages, and limited resources. Committees attempt oversight over the executive branch but have few staff. The 2007 elections resulted in the election of a former prime minister as president. The 2007 parliamentary and presidential elections in East Timor led to the election of former prime minister Ramos-Horta as president, with Xanana Gusmao becoming prime minister. Fretilin party won the most seats but did not have a majority in parliament, leading to protests. Prior to the 2007 elections, East Timor held an election in 2001 to draft a new Constitution. In 2007, Xanana Gusmao became prime minister of East Timor after the parliamentary elections. The Fretilin party did not have a majority, leading to protests. Prior to this, in 2001, an election was held to draft a new Constitution. Gusmao won the 2002 Presidential election with a high voter turnout. Events in 2006 led to the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers, including a large Australian military contingent. In 2006, events led to the deterioration of East Timor's internal security, prompting the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia. The Australian military contingent was the largest with 1,100 troops. UN Security Council Resolution 1704 established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) to support stability and democratic governance. The UNMIT mission in East Timor included civilian and police personnel, as well as military liaison officers, to support stability and democratic governance. The source of the 2006 strife was divisions within the Fretilin party, leading to paramilitary units within the police and splits between the military and police forces. Xanana Gusmao, a former military commander of Fretilin's Falintil, had loyalists in the military, leading to the creation of paramilitary units within the police force in East Timor. Divisions between the military and police stemmed from recruitment processes and tensions between a pluralistic president and an authoritarian ruling party. The dismissal of 591 military members in East Timor by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in 2006 led to political turmoil. The military members protested their conditions and claimed discrimination, causing tensions between the eastern and western districts of East Timor. In March 2006, 591 military members were dismissed in East Timor for protesting conditions and pay, leading to political turmoil. The upper echelons of the military were mainly from eastern districts, while political leadership and police were from western districts. The dismissal sparked rioting, looting, and the fleeing of thousands of eastern East Timorese from the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri stepped down in June amidst accusations of forming \"hit squads.\" In April 2006, rioting, looting, and deaths led to the fleeing of thousands from Dili. Alkatiri resigned in June amid accusations of forming \"hit squads.\" Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced for authorizing weapons transfer to supporters. Major Reinado, a leader in the protests, had support from the west. Interior Minister Lobato had a strained relationship with Gusmao and armed the police. Major Reinado led violent protests and escaped from prison with 50 supporters. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado in March 2007. The government decided to apprehend Reinado after he convinced a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. Reinado had garnered support among young men resentful of the government. Reinado persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles on February 25, 2007. He had support among young men resentful of the government and was involved in escalating violence in East Timor. Gangs of unemployed youth also contributed to the violence in Dili. Unemployment and underemployment in East Timor is estimated to be as high as 70%, leading to gang violence, deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. The instability since April 2006 has affected livelihoods, with 100,000 people remaining displaced by February 2007. Many did not have homes to return to due to damage or destruction. By February 2007, an estimated 100,000 people (10% of the population) remained displaced in East Timor, with 30,000 as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in camps in Dili and 70,000 with host families in the districts. Lack of access to clean water and poor sanitation posed significant health risks for IDPs. The overall context in East Timor included high poverty rates, child mortality due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition, as well as rice shortages and rising food prices. In East Timor, over 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, with high child mortality rates due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages and increased food prices were also concerns. Deteriorating social structures affected healthcare, education, and disaster response. Distribution of essentials and projects focused on IDPs, but needs were significant countrywide. Transitioning from humanitarian to development activities remains challenging due to extreme poverty levels. Funding has increased during times of insecurity and displacement. In Timor, distribution of basic essentials and projects for IDPs were implemented, but needs were significant countrywide. Transitioning from humanitarian to development activities remains a challenge due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increased during times of insecurity and displacement, with the UN providing emergency assistance during periods of violence in 2006. In 2006, nearly $40 million was contributed to a Flash Appeal by UNOCHA. Security incidents in February and March 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, affecting access and safety for displaced individuals and aid organizations. Concerns about displacement due to civil unrest prompted contingency planning by NDMO and MTRC. The international humanitarian aid community, including the UN, NGOs, and donor governments, provided assistance alongside the U.N. peacekeeping operation. In April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery and reintegration packages, and the government began decommissioning some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with assistance from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration. By November 2008, roughly 10,400 families had received recovery assistance. In November 2008, around 10,400 families received recovery packages and returned as the government decommissioned some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity, with help from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration, oversaw the returns process. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remains a challenge for returning IDPs, exacerbated by rising food prices and shortages. Land disputes and home conditions also affect the sustainability of returns. The deteriorating food security situation in East Timor since 2008 is attributed to various factors such as water scarcity, high food prices, shortages of dietary staples, lack of arable land, and the impact of natural disasters. Challenges in reintegration of IDPs include unsettled land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence in their home villages. The U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs emphasized the need for sustainable returns and durable solutions during his visit in December 2008. In December 2008, the U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs visited East Timor and emphasized the need for sustainable returns and durable solutions. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ended its formal mission, but a national staff member continues to work with a small humanitarian team within UNMIT. The U.N. Security Council established the U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste to assist with the fragile security, political, and humanitarian situation. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was established to assist with the fragile security, political, and humanitarian situation in East Timor. The mission includes a civilian component, police personnel, and military liaison officers to support the electoral process. The mandate was extended until February 26, 2008, with temporary reinforcement of police for national elections. Cooperation with the International Security Force (ISF) was also emphasized. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was deployed in 2006 with troops from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Portugal. The mandate was extended multiple times until 2010. East Timor has become relatively more stable, but challenges like reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment persist. In 2009, East Timor is more stable than in 2006, but challenges remain such as reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment. The Secretary General highlighted the need for long-term commitment by the international community to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance. The Secretary General emphasized the importance of long-term commitment by the international community to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance in East Timor. Key areas of focus included political developments, restoration of public security, and support for democratic governance, socio-economic development, and humanitarian relief. The Secretary General's report in early January 2009 focused on political and security developments, promotion of human rights and administration of justice, and increased socio-economic development and humanitarian assistance in East Timor. Key areas included dialogue and reconciliation, improving democratic governance, public security, and capacity building in the justice system. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor since 1999 have evolved in phases, with a focus on justice system, socio-economic development, and humanitarian assistance. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1246 (1999) authorized the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) to oversee the transition period after a national referendum on East Timor's status. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor have evolved in phases since 1999. Resolution 1246 authorized UNAMET to organize a national referendum. After the post-referendum violence, Resolution 1264 authorized INTERFET. UNTAET was established to administer a multi-dimensional peacekeeping operation. On October 19, 1999, Indonesia's parliament confirmed the results of the August referendum. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established on October 25, 1999, to administer East Timor's transition to independence. UNTAET's mandate included providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, establishing a functioning government, and aiding East Timorese refugees. In September 2000, three U.N. humanitarian workers were killed by East Timorese militia groups. The United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) was established in 2002 to assist East Timor in recovering from violence, establishing a government, and aiding refugees. The mission was extended until 2005, and a special political mission, the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL), was established in 2005 for peace-building activities. The United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) was established in 2005 as a special political mission to support state institutions, strengthen democratic governance, and develop a national police force. Activities included capacity building in justice and finance, human rights observance, and progress towards mandated programs. The United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) was established in 2005 to support state institutions, strengthen democratic governance, and develop a national police force, particularly the Border Patrol Unit. Sukehiro Hasegawa, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, highlighted progress in building necessary skills, training national judges, developing expertise in the finance sector, drafting a strategic plan for democratic governance and human rights, and assessing and training the Border Patrol Unit. Progress had been made in the finance sector, drafting a strategic plan for democratic governance and human rights, and training the Border Patrol Unit. However, concerns were raised about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance, unresolved human rights issues, and accountability for crimes in East Timor in 1999. International advisory support was crucial for continued success, with concerns about pending civil and criminal cases, the need for outside supervision of human rights activities, and additional training for the Border Patrol Unit. Despite progress, the situation was described as \"fragile\" by Mr. Hasegawa, emphasizing the importance of stability and peace for the upcoming elections. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times due to escalating violence in 2006. The 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections in East Timor required stability and peace for confidence in the political system. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times in 2006 due to escalating violence. The United States provided bilateral assistance for building a self-sufficient economy and basic public services in East Timor. The United States provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for building a self-sufficient economy, basic public services, and supporting good governance through democratic initiatives. This aid has helped in the economic and political development of East Timor by strengthening institutions and capacity. Experts believe that sustained support is still needed for East Timor's progress. The United States has provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for economic and political development, including support for independent media, civil society organizations, and political parties. Sustained support is still needed for strengthening governmental capacity and the electoral process. The U.S. will focus on re-establishing basic government functions, including security services, according to a 2010 State Department budget document. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provides non-food humanitarian assistance during international crises and disasters, facilitating U.S. government emergency assistance. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) under USAID provides non-food humanitarian assistance during international crises and disasters, facilitating U.S. government emergency aid. OFDA works through grants to partners like U.N. agencies and NGOs. USAID also administers the Food for Peace Program (FFP) for U.S. food aid. In East Timor, both OFDA and FFP are utilized for humanitarian efforts, with OFDA funding partners for tasks like humanitarian coordination and shelter. In East Timor, USAID provided approximately $3.1 million in humanitarian assistance in FY2008, with funding from OFDA, FFP, and CMM. In FY2007, the total assistance was around $3.4 million, and in FY2006, it was approximately $2.2 million. In 2005, supporters argued East Timor was not ready for U.N. departure due to fragile state institutions. Events in 2006 proved them correct, highlighting the need to improve security services, judiciary, transparency, and rule of law. Consideration of U.N.'s presence terms is crucial to prevent destabilization upon departure. The United States' relations with East Timor have been closely tied to its relations with Indonesia. Congress has expressed concern over past human rights abuses in East Timor by the Indonesian military. The East Timorese government is looking to move forward and establish a productive relationship with Indonesia. The Indonesian military and militias have caused concern in the past, leading to restrictions on US-Indonesia military contact. East Timor aims to move forward and improve relations with Indonesia despite past issues. The US considers human rights concerns in its policies towards both countries. Proposed legislation includes Timor-Leste for tariff relief assistance, emphasizing mutual economic growth and development. The proposed legislation, S. 1141, aims to include Timor-Leste for tariff relief assistance, highlighting mutual economic growth and development. Timor-Leste's main external relations are with Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Indonesia, and China, with aspirations to join ASEAN. Australia and New Zealand have been key supporters of peace and security in Timor-Leste since 1999. Australia and New Zealand have been active in supporting peace and security in Timor-Leste since 1999, with Australia viewing Timor as within its strategic interest. Australian and New Zealand troops make up the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Timor, with Australian police also working alongside officers from other countries to provide security in Dili. Australia has a historical connection to Timor, having fought Japanese forces there during World War II. Australia has strategic interest in Timor-Leste and has historical ties to the region. Australian troops fought in Timor during World War II and have been involved in providing security in Dili as part of the ISF. Australia also has economic interests in the hydrocarbon resources in the Timor Sea. The Timor Gap Treaty of December 1989 gave Indonesia control of the province, covering joint hydrocarbon development with Australia. This treaty was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty in 2003 between Australia and Timor-Leste. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, both countries have a working relationship for joint development. Timor-Leste hopes for a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin. Commercial concerns favor the latter due to the geography of the seabed floor and political security issues in Timor. Timor-Leste hopes for a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin. Commercial concerns favor Darwin due to the geography of the seabed floor and political security issues in Timor. Key commercial participants in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a long-standing relationship with Portugal, resulting in a predominantly Catholic population. Timor-Leste has a strong historical connection with Portugal, leading to a predominantly Catholic population. Portuguese is an official language, and Portugal provides foreign assistance, including language teachers and a cultural center in Dili. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste after Portuguese colonial rule ended in 1975, leading to a guerilla movement and significant casualties. After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Timor-Leste was invaded by Indonesia, leading to a guerilla movement and widespread casualties. Indonesian military-backed militias destroyed infrastructure and killed many Timorese, especially after the 1999 referendum for independence. The Indonesian government's actions were seen as a message to other provinces with secessionist movements. Despite efforts for positive relations since 2004, President Ramos-Horta believes those responsible for the atrocities in 1999 will never be held accountable. Since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Timor-Leste has faced challenges including an invasion by Indonesia and atrocities in 1999. President Ramos-Horta has urged the nation to move forward and accept that accountability for the atrocities may never be achieved. Indonesia's involvement in arming and funding militias in 1999 has been acknowledged by a truth commission. Former Indonesian General Wiranto, linked to human rights abuses in East Timor, ran for vice president in the 2009 elections. China has increased investment in its relationship with Timor-Leste since 2005. Former Indonesian General Wiranto, responsible for human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999, ran for vice president in the 2009 Indonesian elections. China has been increasing its investment in Timor-Leste since 2005 to balance U.S. influence, access hydrocarbon resources, and prevent Timor from aligning with Taiwan on the One-China policy. This rise of Chinese influence in Timor may concern Australian strategic planners. China's increasing influence in Timor-Leste is a concern for Australian strategic planners, who see Timor as within their sphere of influence. China has undertaken high-profile projects in Timor, including assisting in the construction of government buildings and selling patrol vessels and defense equipment. Timor's Foreign Minister supports a One-China policy and China's efforts to help Timor join ASEAN. Plans to purchase power stations from China for $381 million are also in progress. Timor-Leste's Foreign Minister supports a One-China policy and China's efforts to help Timor join ASEAN. Plans to purchase power stations from China for $381 million faced criticism for being unnecessary and polluting. Fretilin opposes the proposal and is preparing a legal challenge. Timor became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 2005 and is interested in full ASEAN membership. Timor's off-shore energy resources could be significant if managed properly. East Timor's Fretilin opposes a proposal and is preparing a legal challenge. The country became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 2005 and is interested in full ASEAN membership. Timor's extensive off-shore energy resources could provide necessary financial resources for development. Disagreements with Australia over maritime boundaries have been somewhat resolved through revenue sharing agreements. In 2006, a treaty increased East Timor's share of hydrocarbon revenues. In January 2006, Australia and East Timor signed a treaty increasing East Timor's share of hydrocarbon revenues to 50% for the Greater Sunrise field, earning an estimated $360 million in 2005-2006. East Timor also benefits from a 90%-10% revenue sharing agreement for the Bayu-Udan field. The completion of processing centers in Darwin, Australia has facilitated this revenue sharing. East Timor continues to prefer a pipeline to East Timor for resource extraction. The Greater Sunrise field is estimated to contain 300 million barrels of light oil and 2.53 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Industry favors Darwin over East Timor for processing centers due to seabed configuration and lack of infrastructure. ConocoPhillips has built a new LNG plant near Darwin. East Timor prefers a LNG plant on its southern coast. Bayu-Udan field expected to be depleted by 2023. East Timor has earned $3.2-5 billion in energy revenues since 2005, mostly placed in a Petroleum Fund. East Timor has earned between $3.2 billion and $5 billion in energy revenues since 2005, with most of the funds placed in a Petroleum Fund. The government has been criticized for spending money from the fund, which was intended to save oil and gas revenues for future generations. Timor's top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. The country is described as the poorest in Asia and one of the poorest in the world, with a dual economy and widespread poverty. The violence of 1999 left much of the country's infrastructure devastated. East Timor is the poorest country in Asia and one of the poorest in the world, with a dual economy and widespread poverty. The violence of 1999 left much of the country's infrastructure devastated, with areas lacking basic necessities like electricity, clean water, and good roads. The international community has supported East Timor, but sustained efforts are needed for job creation, infrastructure reconstruction, and improved health and literacy rates. Language barriers exist, as Indonesian is more widely used than the official Tetun or Portuguese. Economic development is crucial for the East Timorese people to improve their living conditions. East Timor's rehabilitation requires sustained efforts for job creation, infrastructure development, and improved health and literacy rates. Economic development is crucial for improving the standard of living, with external assistance remaining critical post-independence. The UNDAF provides a strategic roadmap for U.N. agencies, while challenges include strengthening democratic institutions and education for workforce development. Other economic activities include coffee, tourism, and fisheries. The Timor Gap has increased, with economic activities such as coffee, tourism, and fisheries. Challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, education for workforce development, and rebuilding infrastructure. East Timor is a member of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with interest in ASEAN membership. An international tribunal was recommended for crimes after the 1999 independence referendum, but Indonesia conducted its own investigation. In January 2000, an international commission recommended an international tribunal for crimes after the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor. However, Indonesia conducted its own investigation, leading to dissatisfaction from the United States and other allies. The Serious Crimes Unit of UNMISET indicted over 380 individuals, convicted 55, and acquitted three for their roles in crimes related to the referendum. Only one person has been imprisoned as a result of the Indonesian process. The Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) of UNMISET indicted over 380 individuals for crimes related to the 1999 referendum in East Timor, convicting 55 and acquitting three. President Gusmao supports a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities, with public hearings held in Bali in February 2007. Critics argue that Indonesia has not been held accountable for documented atrocities such as executions, torture, mutilations, and rape in 1999. The first public hearing to address atrocities in East Timor was held in Bali in February 2007. Critics have faulted Gusmao for not holding Indonesia accountable for documented atrocities, including executions, torture, mutilations, and rape in 1999. The 2005 CAVR report detailed these abuses in approximately 2,000 pages. If Gusmao becomes prime minister, it is unlikely that there will be a change in policy regarding past human rights abuses by Indonesians during East Timor's independence. The 2009 State Department Country Report highlighted ongoing human rights issues in Timor-Leste, such as police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and an inefficient judiciary. The 2009 State Department Country Report on Human Rights practices in Timor-Leste highlighted serious human rights issues including police brutality, arbitrary arrests, an inefficient judiciary, and problems with discipline and accountability in the National Police and Defense Forces. Questions were raised about extending the U.N. presence in East Timor beyond the mandate of the UNOTIL mission in 2006. The government had control over the National Police and Defense Forces in East Timor, but there were issues with discipline and accountability. There were debates about extending the U.N. presence in East Timor due to concerns about the country's readiness for independence. East Timor requested continued U.N. assistance to improve security services, judiciary, and institutional transparency. The United States, however, believed East Timor should reduce its reliance on the U.N. East Timor requested U.N. assistance to improve security services, judiciary, and institutional transparency. The United States suggested reducing reliance on the U.N. but continuing support in key sectors like democratic institutions, infrastructure, and security training. Assistance could come from other international sources like the UNDP, World Bank, and expert advisors. The debate surrounds the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states like East Timor, with questions about the duration of UN presence, necessary international support, and criteria for measuring aid effectiveness and national capacity building progress. Donor fatigue and limited budgets add pressure for assistance. Questions arise about the duration of the United Nations' presence in fragile states like East Timor, the required international support, and criteria for measuring aid effectiveness and national capacity building progress.
