    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts fund federal highway and mass transit programs, safety, research, and some rail programs. The most recent authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009, leading to a series of extension acts. The budgetary environment has changed since SAFETEA in 2005, with constrained financial resources. The highway trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel taxes, has seen declining revenues due to economic conditions and vehicle improvements. The highway trust fund (HTF) has been the main source of funding for surface transportation bills since 1956. However, revenues from highway taxes have decreased due to the economy and improved fuel efficiency. The ongoing debate revolves around passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved. In the fiscal context, issues such as alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management are being debated. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on surface transportation reauthorization. The Senate passed MAP-21, a bill reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion, linking transportation reauthorization with provisions for oil and gas production. Controversially, H.R. 7 discontinues funding mass transit with Highway Trust Fund revenues. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The bill includes provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273), and environmental streamlining. The Senate agreed to an amendment that replaced the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with the language of MAP-21, enabling the measure to go to conference for negotiations involving the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica is involved in the negotiations. The House and Senate sent the measure to conference for negotiations involving the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex due to multiple committees involved. The highway trust fund is mainly financed by excise taxes on motor fuels. The highway trust fund is financed mainly by excise taxes on motor fuels, with 90% of revenue coming from fuel taxes. The fund consists of two accounts for highway and mass transit, with specific allocations from the gasoline tax. Fuel tax rates have not been raised since 1993, and revenues do not increase with inflation. The highway account receives revenue from fuel taxes set in cents per gallon, not as a percentage of sale price, leading to stagnant revenues due to inflation. Economic slowdown and improved fuel efficiency have decreased tax revenues below expectations, requiring transfers from the general fund. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $4.6 billion shortfall in the Highway account by FY2013. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $4.6 billion shortfall in the Highway account by FY2013, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is expected to fall into a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014, deepening rapidly thereafter. Without an increase in fuel taxes, authorizers face challenges in moving reauthorization legislation. The general fund transfer in FY2010 will remain above zero through FY2013 but then fall to a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014, deepening to $5 billion by the end of FY2015. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the fuel-based trust fund taxation system will not be able to support transportation spending, leading to a choice for policymakers between finding new revenue sources or settling for a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program faces financial challenges as it administers various programs under FHWA. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (Highway Program) faces financial challenges as it administers various state-run programs with federal funding. State DOTs determine spending but must follow federal guidelines. Projects require state/local matching shares, typically 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. Policymakers must decide between finding new revenue sources or accepting a smaller program due to a shortfall in fuel taxes. The Federal Highway Administration oversees project development and construction, with states/local governments providing matching shares for federally funded highway projects. Funds are distributed through apportionment and allocation, with reimbursement occurring after project approval and costs are incurred. The distribution of funds among states is done through apportionment and allocation, with reimbursement happening after project approval and costs are incurred. Contract authority allows for obligation without appropriation, and limitation on obligations is used for control. The FHWA uses contract authority to legally commit the federal government to reimburse states for project costs before an appropriation is made. The ObLim sets a limit on annual FHWA spending, similar to an appropriation, and there are formula and discretionary programs for distributing funds among states. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through formula-driven programs like Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, Surface Transportation, Highway Bridge, Congestion Mitigation, and Highway Safety Improvement. These programs receive 80% of SAFETEA's contract authority for funding federal-aid highway projects. The core formula programs under SAFETEA receive roughly 80% of the contract authority for federal-aid highway projects. These programs include Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, Surface Transportation, Highway Bridge, Congestion Mitigation, Air Quality Improvement, Highway Safety Improvement, and Equity Bonus Program. Each program's formula determines each state's portion of the total authorized amount. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for Highway Safety Improvement. The Equity Bonus Program is the largest highway program in dollar terms, guaranteeing each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas. State DOTs have increasing flexibility to transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. Some argue that the program structure limits their use of federal highway funds as they see fit. Each state must receive total formula program funding equal to at least 92% of its highway users' tax payments. The Equity Bonus Program, the largest highway program in dollar terms, guarantees each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas. It is seen as limiting states' use of federal highway funds as they wish. Additionally, smaller discretionary highway programs are part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, with most funding earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. The Federal-Aid Highway Program includes various programs controlled by FHWA, with funding earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. The federal transit program, administered by FTA, consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and eligibility rules. The federal transit program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. Funding in two programs, the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, is distributed by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are used for rail modernization. The Program in SAFETEA accounts for 41% of authorized transit funding and provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Funds can be used for various expenses including capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations in urbanized areas with populations of up to 200,000. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds, 16% of authorized transit funding, are mainly for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program, accounting for 18% of overall authorized transit funding, is available on a competitive basis for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. The New Starts program in SAFETEA accounts for 18% of overall authorized transit funding and is available on a competitive basis for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. It has funded projects for various transit modes including busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, automated guideway systems, and vintage trolleys. Additionally, a new \"Small Starts\" program was enacted to fund projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with an annual funding of $200 million from FY2007. The Bus Program funds, totaling 9% of authorized funding, are used to purchase buses and related equipment, as well as for constructing facilities like administrative and maintenance buildings, transfer facilities, bus shelters, and park-and-ride stations. The Bus Program receives $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization starting in FY2007. These funds are used to purchase buses, equipment, and construct various facilities. Other smaller funding programs account for the remaining 15% of transit program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States, with safety primarily the responsibility of the states. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States. States have the primary responsibility for highway safety and Congress has established federal highway safety programs to assist them. Three DOT agencies administer these programs: NHTSA focuses on driver behavior and vehicle safety, FMCSA on commercial driver qualifications and vehicle safety, and FHWA through the Highway Safety Improvement Program. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and FHWA administer highway safety programs authorized in SAFETEA. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant funds. States must submit highway safety plans approved by NHTSA to receive federal traffic safety funds. Plans must identify safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. NHTSA also provides training. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) administers highway safety programs by requiring states to submit approved plans to receive federal traffic safety funds. Plans must identify safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. NHTSA provides grants through various programs to support state efforts in improving traffic safety. FMCSA administers motor carrier safety grant programs to ensure the safety of truck and motor coach operations, including vehicle inspections and licensing of commercial drivers. The programs aim to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries by improving traffic safety measures. The HSIP program aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving road design and operation. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. The program includes set-asides for railway-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and high-risk rural road improvements. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to ensure certain annual funding levels. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to guarantee certain annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects, protecting funds from being reallocated. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 was amended to create \"fire walls\" to prevent funds from being used elsewhere. Appropriators were also prevented from setting lower funding levels by specifying annual funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009. SAFETEA ensured annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects were protected from reallocation. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 created \"fire walls\" to prevent funds from being used elsewhere. Appropriators were prohibited from setting lower funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009. The House rule preventing lower funding levels was eliminated in the 112th Congress, removing the last safeguard. RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway account receipts. The House rule preventing lower funding levels was eliminated in the 112th Congress, removing the last safeguard. RABA allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway account receipts, but Congress has never allowed a negative RABA calculation to lead to a reduction in spending. Despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels, the issue of RABA has been considered moot due to general fund transfers supplementing the HTF. However, a mechanism to align spending with receipts may still be considered in reauthorization. In recent years, the issue of RABA (Revenue Aligned Budget Authority) falling below guarantee levels has been considered moot due to general fund transfers supplementing the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). However, a mechanism to align spending with receipts may still be considered in reauthorization. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions, but exemptions likely mean that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. The \"Super Committee\" failed to reach an agreement in November 2011, leading to exemptions from the sequester process for certain surface transportation programs. While some budget resources are exempt, the $739 million annual contract authority may be subject to sequester. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program could also be affected. The $739 million annual contract authority for Traffic Safety Grants and Motor Carrier Safety Grants may be subject to sequester. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program could also be affected. SAFETEA expired in 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for surface transportation programs through September 2012. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for surface transportation programs through September 30, 2012, and includes new legislative provisions. The Senate substituted the full text of MAP-21 for the House-passed language, leading to a conference between the two chambers. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica has indicated that negotiations will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7. Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica has stated that negotiations on the House extension legislation, MAP-21 and STEA-II, will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7. Provisions in conference proposals must align with the differences between the House and Senate versions. Any out-of-scope provisions in conference reports may face points of order in both chambers. Waivers can be granted in the House through a simple resolution, while the Senate has its own process for waiving points of order. The conference on H.R. 4348 may face points of order if it contains provisions outside the scope. The House can waive the rule with a majority vote, while the Senate requires support from 60 Senators. STEA-II includes unrelated provisions like the North American Energy Access Act, transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. Title II of STEA-II includes provisions from the proposed North American Energy Access Act (H.R. 3548) transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It also establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund financed by 80% of amounts collected from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, financed by 80% of Deepwater Horizon-related penalties under the Clean Water Act. Revenues are distributed to Gulf Coast states, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and research. Unlike a previous bill, future revenue distribution requires an act of Congress. The House-passed H.R. 4348 outlines revenue distribution from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, with 35% to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. Unlike S. 1400, this bill requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution. Title V of the bill includes provisions from the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title V of H.R. 4348 includes provisions from the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. The House and Senate bills aim to expedite project delivery and reduce the number of highway programs. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that funds the Federal-Aid Highway Program with changes to structure, formulas, and funding distribution. Total Federal-Aid Highway Program authorization is $39.5 billion. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that aims to expedite project delivery and reduce the number of highway programs by roughly two-thirds. It would make substantial changes to the structure, formulas, and funding distribution of the federal highway program, with a total authorization of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013. The bill eliminates all formula factors under individual programs and apportions funds to states based on their share of total apportionments and allocations during FY2005-FY2009. The MAP-21 bill replaces individual program formulas with a calculation based on states' shares of total apportionments and allocations from FY2005-FY2009. This change reduces federal and congressional influence on project selection, as there are no longer program formulas or earmarked projects. National interests and needs will be driven by federal planning, performance management, and project delivery. MAP-21 reduces congressional influence on project selection by eliminating program formulas and earmarked projects. National interests will be driven by federal planning, performance management, and project eligibility requirements. The number of programs will be reduced by two-thirds, with program eligibility shifting to core programs. Discretionary grant programs under FHWA control will be eliminated, and the Transportation Enhancements Program will be rolled into the CMAQ program. States will have more flexibility in spending TE funds starting in FY2013. The Senate bill under MAP-21 reduces congressional influence on project selection by eliminating program formulas and earmarked projects. It aims to reduce the number of programs by two-thirds, shifting program eligibility to core programs and eliminating discretionary grant programs under FHWA control. The Transportation Enhancements Program will be merged into the CMAQ program, allowing states more flexibility in spending TE funds starting in FY2013. Additionally, the bill increases funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program and introduces a National Freight Program to increase funding for freight projects. The Senate bill increases funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program nearly ten-fold, but is silent on tolling of federally funded roads. The House bill provides modest increases for federal-aid highways and research/education funding. Existing programs would be folded into new programs under the reauthorization bill. The reauthorization bill includes modest increases for federal-aid highways and research/education funding, folding existing programs into new ones. The Equity Bonus program guarantees a 94% state rate of return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund, while the Mass Transit Account is renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for both mass transit and highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected. The reauthorization bill includes a rate of return guarantee on payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for mass transit and highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected to the Highway Account. Provisions under the streamlining title would change requirements in the National Environmental Policy Act for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total costs. TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold. MAP-21 would fund the Federal Transit Administration at the current level, with the Highway Trust Fund providing 79.9% of the funding. The House bill proposes changes to funding for highway and transit projects, including exempting projects under $10 million or with less than 15% federal funding from certain requirements. TIFIA funding would increase significantly. MAP-21 would fund the Federal Transit Administration at the current level, with the Highway Trust Fund providing majority of the funding. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for a State of Good Repair program and modifications to the New Starts process. The House bill proposes changes to funding for highway and transit projects, including exempting smaller projects from certain requirements. H.R. 7 would authorize funding for the Guideway Modernization Program and the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program. It includes modifications to the New Starts process and renames the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account. Funding for the ATA would come from transferring $40 billion from the general fund and eliminating certain grant programs. H.R. 7 provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account. The ATA would be funded by transferring $40 billion from the general fund and eliminating certain grant programs. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool for intercity passenger services, and positive train control implementation for freight rail. The Bus and Bus-related Facilities Program by formula is included in MAP-21, which also calls for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool for intercity passenger services, and positive train control implementation for freight rail. The bill would amend the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program (RRIF) for freight and passenger railroads, accept state or local subsidies as collateral, and make modest changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The House bill contains provisions on Amtrak funding, RRIF program, and positive train control implementation to close the gap between projected HTF revenues and total authorizations. The House bill includes provisions on Amtrak funding, the RRIF program, and positive train control implementation to bridge the gap between projected HTF revenues and total authorizations. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes and trust fund expenditure authority. It includes measures to raise revenue and provide offsets for the HTF, including transfers from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund balance. The curr_chunk discusses various revenue sources and offsets totaling $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the HTF. This includes transfers from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund balance, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports of tax delinquents, Medicare provider payment levy, future import tariffs on automotive products, and a change in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations. The curr_chunk details revenue sources and offsets totaling $13.872 billion for the HTF over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes funds from various sources such as Medicare provider payment levy, future import tariffs on automotive products, changes in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations, and pension funding stabilization. The curr_chunk outlines revenue sources and offsets totaling $13.872 billion for the HTF over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes transfers of excess pension assets, pension funding stabilization, transfers from the Treasury general fund, phased retirement offerings by federal agencies, reporting of life insurance policy sales, extension of taxes on cigarette manufacturers, and delaying worldwide interest expense allocation. The curr_chunk outlines revenue sources and offsets totaling $13.872 billion for the HTF over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes phased retirement offerings by federal agencies, reporting of life insurance policy sales, extension of taxes on cigarette manufacturers, delaying worldwide interest expense allocation, and authorizing special measures against money laundering. These provisions have raised comments as they exceed the needed offset for HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels, providing an opportunity for deficit reduction or additional spending. The Finance Committee also reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including changing the Small Issuer by -$761 million over ten years. The revenue provisions in the curr_chunk exceed the needed offset for HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels, providing an opportunity for deficit reduction or additional spending. The Finance Committee also reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception, bonds treatment for tax purposes, employer-provided benefits, and the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. The curr_chunk discusses various revenue provisions, including the exclusion of certain bonds from tax preference, extending employer-provided benefits, and the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate bill also includes provisions for TRIP bonds and changes to the depreciation period for long-term assets. The bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds and changes to the depreciation period for long-term highway leases, potentially impacting highway privatization. The Finance Committee expressed concerns about the current amortization period for toll collection rights being shorter than lease terms. The Finance Committee is concerned about the current amortization period for toll collection rights being shorter than lease terms. The bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds and changes to the depreciation period for long-term highway leases, potentially impacting highway privatization. The finance provision would establish a \"solvency account\" for excess amounts appropriated to the HTF under MAP-21. The Senate bill proposes to establish a \"solvency account\" for excess amounts appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund under MAP-21. This account would ensure a financial cushion of $2.8 billion for both the highway and mass transit accounts by September 30, 2013. Additionally, the bill suggests using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund, which was created in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. It receives revenues from a tax on gasoline and diesel fuels, supporting environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. States use the fund for overseeing corrective actions by responsible parties and conducting actions in emergencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities. The LUST trust fund, established in 1986, helps oversee and enforce corrective actions for leaking underground storage tanks. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities and authorized fund use for leak prevention and cleanup programs. Over 85% of reported releases have been addressed, with 88,000 still requiring cleanup. The fund had a $3.392 billion balance in FY2012, estimated to receive $117 million in interest and $181 million in tax. Since the beginning of the LUST program, over 413,000 releases (85%) have been addressed, leaving a backlog of 88,000 requiring cleanup. The LUST trust fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion in FY2012, estimated to receive $117 million in interest and $181 million in tax receipts. States receive a minimum of 80% of the annual appropriation, with the remainder used by EPA for program implementation. States' LUST programs have primarily relied on nonfederal fund sources due to low appropriations. Section 40301 of the Senate bill would transfer $3.0 billion. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Future LUST trust fund receipts from fuel taxes would also be appropriated to the highway trust fund, totaling $3.685 billion over ten years. The LUST trust fund expenditure authority is set to expire on March 31, 2012, but the Senate bill includes a provision to extend it. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Future transfers from fuel taxes would provide $3.685 billion over ten years. The bill extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority and reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016. Highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, would be extended through FY2018. All future transfers to the HTF from the Treasury must be fully offset. H.R. 7, introduced on February 9, 2012, aims to reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, through FY2018. The bill includes provisions to ensure that all future transfers from the general fund to the HTF are fully offset. It seeks to fill gaps in revenue increases or offsets, including the difference between highway account revenues and authorized levels, as well as $40 billion of general fund resources for the proposed alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund. The bill, H.R. 7, aims to reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes. It includes provisions to ensure all transfers from the general fund to the HTF are fully offset. One gap is the difference between highway revenues and authorized levels, and the bill proposes $40 billion from the general fund for alternative transportation. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate LUST trust fund revenues to the Highway Trust Fund. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions as separate bills on February 16, 2012, under a rule specifying they would be incorporated into H.R. 7. The statutory basis for offshore energy development is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, administered by the Department of the Interior. Offshore program allows leasing for oil and gas resources in federal ocean areas for upfront payments, rentals, and royalties. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion. The Department of the Interior administers the offshore energy leasing program, generating $6.5 billion in federal receipts from oil and gas in FY2011. These receipts are allocated to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. Gulf Coast states also receive additional funds from specified leases. H.R. 7 proposes a $40 billion one-time appropriation to the alternative transportation account, renaming the mass transit account of the HTF. It also transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account and includes provisions for offsetting revenues. MAP-21 suggests total authorizations of $80.8 billion. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, eliminating the Equity Bonus Program and highway program earmarks. It guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA and a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. Section 4001 includes a provision for Highway Spending Controls. MAP-21 eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and highway program earmarks, guaranteeing a state share based on SAFETEA and a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. Section 4001 includes a provision for Highway Spending Controls, ensuring the solvency of the highway account of the HTF through a \"ratchet mechanism.\" The Department of Transportation (DOT) will adjust distribution to states if balance falls below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013. Any withdrawn funds would lapse, and contract authority rescinded. Similar calculations for future years, but only under year-long appropriations bills. Provision related to pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21, commits committee to keeping spending within means of HTF and may increase pressure to identify additional revenue options. The provision in H.R. 7 relates to the pending Highway Trust Fund (HTF) shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels. It commits the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to keeping spending within the means of the HTF and may increase pressure to find additional revenue options. Implementing the ratchet mechanism could face resistance in Congress due to past negative RABA calculations. Despite negative RABA calculations in the past, Congress chose to override reductions by drawing down the positive balance in the HTF. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years. H.R. 7 proposes a $4.4 billion downward adjustment in highway program funding levels, overridden by drawing down the HTF balance. The bill authorizes $205 billion over five years, with additional funding from an Alternative Transportation Account. It does not include spending guarantee mechanisms like SAFETEA, but includes a modified Equity Bonus Program. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes funding highway programs through an Alternative Transportation Account with an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. It includes a modified Equity Bonus Program ensuring states receive at least 94% of their motor fuel taxes back. The bill also funds various highway programs like CMAQ, Ferry Boats, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program. Additionally, it allows for expanded tolling of the Interstate system. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes funding highway programs through an Alternative Transportation Account with an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. It includes funding for various highway programs like CMAQ, Ferry Boats, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program. Additionally, it allows for expanded tolling of the Interstate system, with restrictions on adding toll lanes while maintaining the same number of free lanes. H.R. 7 does not include earmarks and differs from previous authorization acts in how funding is allocated to states. H.R. 7 proposes funding highway programs through an Alternative Transportation Account with an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. It includes funding for various highway programs and allows for expanded tolling of the Interstate system with restrictions on adding toll lanes. Unlike previous authorization acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. H.R. 7 proposes funding highway programs through an Alternative Transportation Account with an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. State apportionments for major programs are determined based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. The initial amounts are adjusted to ensure each state's combined apportionments will not be less than 95% of estimated tax payments made by highway users. Adjustments may not be necessary due to excess federal highway spending over HTF revenues. Additionally, a set-aside amount is determined for the new CMAQ program based on each state's CMAQ percentage and Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The funding for highway programs under H.R. 7 includes an additional $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. State apportionments are determined based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. A set-aside amount is determined for the new CMAQ program based on each state's CMAQ percentage and Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The remaining amount is divided among core programs: 58% for the National Highway Performance Program, 29.3% for the Transportation Mobility Program, 7% for the Highway Safety Improvement Program, and 5.7% for the National Freight Program. The remaining amount of each state's \"initial amount\" is divided among core programs: 58% for the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), 29.3% for the Transportation Mobility Program (TMP), 7% for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), and 5.7% for the National Freight Program (NFP). State apportionments may be adjusted based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. This adjustment applies to formerly publicly operated toll roads that have been privatized, reducing state apportionments accordingly. The apportionments of three states - Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado - would be reduced due to privatized highway lane miles. This reduction would result in increased apportionments for all other states. Illinois would see a 0.087% reduction, Indiana a 4.375% reduction, and Colorado a 0.045% reduction. All other states would see a 0.115% increase in apportionments. Table 5 displays the dollar amounts of the aggregate programmatic split. The apportionments of Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado are reduced due to privatized highway lane miles, resulting in increased apportionments for all other states. Illinois sees a 0.087% reduction, Indiana a 4.375% reduction, and Colorado a 0.045% reduction. All other states receive a 0.115% increase in apportionments. MAP-21 does not have an equity program like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program, instead determining the \"initial amount\" for each state based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. The MAP-21 program aims to bring all states to a minimum percentage return on tax payments, with an adjustment mechanism to ensure at least a 95% rate of return. The initial amount for each state is determined based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be needed to guarantee the 95% return. Some states may prefer using the state return on payments to the HTF to determine the initial amount. If Congress does not provide enough funding for the MAP-21 program, adjustments may be necessary to ensure a 95% return for donor states. Some states may want to use their state return on payments to the HTF to determine the initial amount, rather than their share of total funding from FY2005-FY2009. SAFETEA included a high number of earmarks, with a significant portion not bringing additional funds to states due to Equity Bonus reductions. Funding for highway earmarks under MAP-21 was divided into \"below the line\" and \"above the line\" categories. 67% of earmark funding did not bring additional money to states, while 33% increased funds flowing to receiving states. Although individual earmarks were not extended, states that previously received above-the-line earmarks benefited from higher base amounts under extensions. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks, but states that did well in obtaining above-the-line earmarks under SAFETEA continued to receive apportionment shares based on past funding. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks and reduced the number of funding programs by two-thirds. States that did well in obtaining above-the-line earmarks under SAFETEA continued to benefit from higher base amounts under extensions. The distribution of earmarks among Members of Congress and states was controversial under SAFETEA. MAP-21's initial state share calculation could still favor states that fared well during the SAFETEA earmarking process. MAP-21 reduced funding programs by two-thirds, absorbing their eligibilities into core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013 to improve the National Highway System. The NHPP, the largest program within the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program, would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. It aims to improve the National Highway System by combining three core programs and includes projects to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure improvement. The NHPP, receiving $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013, focuses on improving infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes projects for highway segments, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets, with a limit of 40% of their NHPP apportionment average on new capacity. The program focuses on system maintenance within NHS corridors, with states limited to spending 40% of their NHPP apportionment average on new capacity. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. Funds may be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. This program aims to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads, replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. The Transportation Enhancement set-aside shifts to the enhanced CMAQ program. The Transportation Modernization and Preservation (TMP) program aims to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads, replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. TMP funds, totaling approximately $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, can be used for various transportation projects including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, recreational trails, and more. The program also allows for state participation in natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts. The Transportation Modernization and Preservation (TMP) program funds various transportation projects such as recreational trails, ferry facilities, border infrastructure, scenic roads, truck parking, and safe routes to school. It also allows for state participation in natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to projects under Title 23 U.S.C. TMP funds can be used for maintenance and improvement of public roads near international borders with federally owned vehicles comprising over 50% of traffic. States may face penalties if the total deck area of deficient bridges increases in recent years. The Transportation Modernization and Preservation (TMP) program allows for the maintenance and improvement of public roads near international borders with federally owned vehicles comprising over 50% of traffic. States may face penalties if the total deck area of deficient bridges increases in recent years. Fifty percent of each state's apportionment is based on the relative share of the population residing in different areas, providing more flexibility for states. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program would be eliminated, but its routes and access roads would still be eligible under TMP. The Transportation Modernization and Preservation (TMP) program allows for maintenance and improvement of public roads near international borders with federally owned vehicles comprising over 50% of traffic. States may face penalties if the total deck area of deficient bridges increases. Fifty percent of each state's apportionment is based on population residing in different areas, giving states more flexibility. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program would be eliminated, but its routes and access roads would still be eligible under TMP. CMAQ funding would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. Under MAP-21, CMAQ funding would increase to $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. HSIP funding would remain at $2.5 billion annually for the same period, focusing on improving road safety. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be eliminated, with their project eligibilities retained. The NFP would be a new program aimed at enhancing road condition and performance. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished under MAP-21, with their project eligibilities retained. A new program called the National Freight Program (NFP) would be introduced to improve the condition and performance of a designated national freight network, funded at $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. MAP-21 would also reduce the maximum percentage of funding that a state can transfer between its apportioned programs from 50% to 20%. MAP-21 proposes reducing the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between apportioned programs from 50% to 20%. However, transfers of TMP funding suballocated by population would be prohibited. The core programs under MAP-21 have overlapping eligibility areas, potentially reducing the need for inter-program transfers. H.R. 7, on the other hand, would retain more of the existing core program structure but expand the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program. H.R. 7 expands the National Highway System Program and Surface Transportation Program, absorbing the Interstate Maintenance program. The bill eliminates the 10% set-aside for Transportation Enhancements and provides $150.7 billion for core highway programs from FY2013 to FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Eligibilities of absorbed programs continue under different programs. The National Highway System Program under H.R. 7 would receive $150.7 billion for core highway programs from FY2013 to FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. The bill would expand funding for the maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS, absorbing the existing Interstate Maintenance and Highway Bridge Programs. Only facilities on the NHS would be eligible for funding. The NHS program under H.R. 7 would receive $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for core highway programs, broadening its purpose to include construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels on the National Highway System. States would need to participate in developing state asset management plans for the NHS to support progress toward national performance goals. H.R. 7 would authorize $42.4 billion for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014, broadening its purpose to include bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill eliminates the requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancement purposes and allows up to 15% of funds for areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on minor collectors. H.R. 7 authorizes $10.4 billion for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) for FY2013-FY2014. States must have their own safety programs and plans to receive HSIP funds, which must be developed in consultation with stakeholders and set safety goals. Each plan must identify safety projects and align with performance measures. H.R. 7 would provide $10.4 billion for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) for FY2013-FY2014. States must have their own safety programs and plans to receive funds, developed in consultation with stakeholders, setting safety goals, identifying projects, and aligning with performance measures. Additionally, $8 billion would be allocated for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) over the same period. H.R. 7 authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for transportation programs, including a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments for states. If needed, the Surface Transportation Program (STP) authorization would be decreased to provide additional funds to meet the guarantee. Under SAFETEA, the estimated $40.9 billion contract authority may not be sufficient to bring all states up to 94%. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters. U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a fiscal year. The approved statewide transportation improvement plan during a disaster would not be eligible for ER funds. ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways. U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a fiscal year. The $100 million ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a state would be eliminated. Section 1506 allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for federal government payment of repair costs. The Secretary of Transportation may allow 100% federal share for repairs exceeding the annual state apportionment. H.R. 7, Section 1111, defines \"comparable facility\" for allowable project costs. The Secretary of Transportation may allow 100% federal share for repairs exceeding the annual state apportionment. \"Comparable facility\" is defined for allowable project costs. Reimbursement for debris removal costs is limited to costs not covered by the Stafford Act. U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a fiscal year. Assistance requires a declaration of emergency by the governor or President, with states providing project lists within two years. ER funding is allowed for federal lands highways and tribal roads. The U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a single fiscal year for emergency assistance. Funding would be allowed for federal lands highways and tribal roads. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program with three main components. MAP-21 suggests funding the Tribal Transportation Program at $450 million annually and other federal lands programs at $550 million annually. The new Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program includes three main components: the Tribal Transportation Program, the Federal Lands Transportation Program, and the Federal Lands Access Program. MAP-21 proposes funding the Tribal Transportation Program at $450 million annually and other federal lands programs at $550 million annually. Changes in the Tribal Transportation Program include a new formula for distributing funds based on road mileage and tribal population. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016, and the Federal Lands Transportation program at $535 million annually. The Tribal Transportation Program and Federal Lands Transportation Program are authorized at $465 million and $535 million annually, respectively. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually. Puerto Rico receives a 75% set-aside, while other territories receive a 25% set-aside. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually. Puerto Rico receives a 75% set-aside, while other territories receive a 25% set-aside. Each year, $45 million is allocated for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with Puerto Rico receiving a $135 million annual set-aside. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill incorporates the ADHS into the new Transportation Mobility Program. Section 1530 increases the federal share for constructing highways and access roads on the Appalachian Development. The Senate bill eliminates the ADHS program and incorporates its eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility Program. It raises the federal share for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. H.R. 7 retains the program at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016, with funds available until expended. States can use toll credits for the local matching share. Funds are apportioned based on the latest cost estimate, with no state receiving less than 1% and no state receiving more than 25%. The Senate bill establishes a discretionary program with a budget authority of $1 billion for FY2013 to fund high-cost surface transportation projects. States can use toll credits for matching share, with funds apportioned based on cost estimates. The program aims to improve national competitiveness, reduce congestion, enhance energy security, and promote transportation safety. The program aims to fund critical high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects that would generate national and regional economic benefits, reduce congestion, improve energy security, enhance freight and people movement, and increase transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on project selection within three years. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would create a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities with funding distributed based on a formula. The Senate bill, H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119, would establish a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities. Funding distribution would be based on a formula considering factors like total passengers, vehicles carried per day, and route miles serviced by ferry systems. MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013 for ferry boats and facilities. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) proposes funding of $67 million annually for ferry boats and facilities under the Alternative Transportation Account. Distribution of funds would be based on factors like total passengers, vehicles carried, and route miles serviced by ferry systems. The House bill proposes funding of $67 million annually for ferry boats and facilities under the Alternative Transportation Account. Funds would be distributed based on factors like total passengers, vehicles carried, and route miles serviced by ferry systems. Additionally, ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for formula funds under the National Highway System Program. The House bill proposes funding for ferry boats and facilities based on factors like total passengers, vehicles carried, and route miles serviced. TIFIA provides federal credit assistance for transportation projects, with MAP-21 proposing significant changes to enlarge the program by authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund to pay administrative and subsidy costs. This would increase the capacity for DOT to make loans totaling $9.9 billion per year and allow TIFIA to provide up to 49% of project costs. MAP-21 proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including increasing the subsidy cost to 10% and allowing loans totaling $9.9 billion per year. It also suggests raising the share of project costs TIFIA can provide to 49% and allowing credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a master credit agreement. This change is sought by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accelerate financing for 12 transit projects. The eligibility threshold for projects remains at $50 million, except for intelligent transportation system projects, which would have a threshold of $25 million under MAP-21. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is seeking changes to the TIFIA program to accelerate financing for 12 transit projects. MAP-21 proposes a threshold of $25 million for rural infrastructure projects, with loans offered at half the Treasury rate. Additionally, 10% of TIFIA funds in MAP-21 are reserved for rural projects. The TIFIA program in MAP-21 aims to provide financing for rural infrastructure projects at half the Treasury rate. Projects are evaluated on eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis, with 10% of TIFIA funds reserved for rural projects. Funding can be exhausted for the year, allowing project sponsors to enter into a master credit agreement or pay their own credit subsidy. The TIFIA program in MAP-21 provides financing for infrastructure projects on a first-come, first-served basis. Project sponsors can enter into a master credit agreement or pay their own credit subsidy once funding is exhausted. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with funds available for administrative and subsidy costs. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million. H.R. 7 proposes to expand TIFIA by increasing federal assistance to 49%, establishing master credit agreements, and setting thresholds for different types of projects. It also authorizes $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. H.R. 7 proposes to authorize $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks and raises the maximum federal assistance to 49%. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with most funding provided through regular highway programs like the Surface Transportation Program. The SAFETEA program provides funding for passenger and freight mobility within the larger surface transportation program. While most freight-related funding is channeled through regular highway programs like the Surface Transportation Program, there is a debate on whether a more focused federal effort towards funding freight improvements is needed. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) contains provisions but no similar program. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) contains provisions that significantly affect freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare a national freight transport plan and seek to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new core program to direct funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement. The Secretary of Transportation would designate a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) based on freight volume, consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways. States would be guided to prioritize spending on the PFN before other areas. Private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements, such as expanding the TIFIA program, could enhance freight carriers and shippers' roles in project planning and development. The Senate bill proposes a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles for freight movement. States would prioritize spending on the PFN before other areas. The Secretary of Transportation could add 3,000 more miles to the PFN. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density. States can spend up to 20% of their freight program on these corridors. The Senate bill proposes a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles prioritizing spending on freight movement. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density and spend up to 20% of their freight program funds on these roads. The PFN, critical rural freight corridors, and portions of the Interstate System would be part of the \"national freight network (NFM).\" States could also allocate funds for non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows cost-effectively. Additionally, states could use up to 10% of their funds for freight rail or maritime projects. States can allocate funds for non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows more cost-effectively. Up to 10% of funds can be used for freight rail or maritime projects if they significantly improve freight flow and provide a better return than a highway project on the PFN. Creating a specific funding program for freight movement and requiring states to develop performance measures will enhance consideration of freight needs in project selection. The PFN, consisting of about 30,000 miles of highway, concentrates funds on critical segments for freight movement. The designation of a PFN with 30,000 miles of highway would focus funds on critical segments for freight movement. DOT estimates that congested urban interchanges cause trucks to travel below the speed limit during rush hours on 4,700 miles of highway, with an additional 3,700 miles experiencing stop-and-go conditions. States may be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks over local shippers. Programs like TIFIA support national projects. Trucks face stop-and-go conditions at urban interchanges during rush hours. States may be reluctant to address costly bottlenecks that mainly benefit trucks over local shippers. Funding for these projects could be supported by programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ under MAP-21. The Senate bill requires a study on potential changes to truck size and weight limits. The House bill focuses on funding freight transport by reducing funding for non-shipping programs and stopping the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund. The House bill aims to concentrate funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-shipping programs and stopping the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund. It also seeks to increase reliance on tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The bill initially proposed raising truck weight limits to 97,000 pounds with a sixth axle, but this was replaced by a call for a DOT study on the issue. H.R. 7 does not increase truck weight limits to 97,000 pounds but calls for a DOT study on the issue. It allows for longer double trailers for LTL carriers and truckload carriers, as well as longer auto transporters. The bill includes a pilot program for three states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on certain Interstate Highway segments. The House bill allows for longer auto transporters up to 80 feet and a pilot program for three states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on certain Interstate Highway segments. It also includes a weight exemption increase for idle reduction equipment. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, emphasizing the use of performance management throughout the planning process. MAP-21 proposes substantial changes to transportation planning requirements, emphasizing the use of performance management at national, state, and local levels. It includes a requirement for the use of performance measures and targets in state and metropolitan planning, with consequences for failing to meet targets being relatively mild. The bill also introduces a new National Freight Program at the national level. The specific performance measures and targets for transportation planning would be set by states and MPOs themselves. Failure to meet targets would require a remedial plan. MAP-21 introduces a National Freight Program, requiring a national freight strategic plan with quantifiable performance measures. States must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. Failure to make progress would necessitate a freight performance improvement plan submission to the Secretary of Transportation. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. Failure to meet targets would necessitate submitting a freight performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan are included in the Act. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. Provisions in the Act include the development and implementation of a national surface transportation and freight strategic plan, with some provisions repeating or conflicting with those in Division A, Title I. An example of repetitive provisions is the national goal to reduce traffic fatalities, while conflicting provisions involve timelines for developing national strategic plans for freight. Each state would need to develop a risk-based asset management plan as part of the new National Highway Performance Program. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. It includes provisions for the development of a national strategic freight plan and a national surface transportation and freight performance plan within specific timelines. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies. The Secretary would establish minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with states potentially having to redirect federal funds to address deficiencies. The Secretary would set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions on the Interstate System and NHS under MAP-21. States may need to redirect federal funds if conditions fall below the minimum. State planning requirements would remain mostly unchanged, with the addition of incorporating metropolitan and nonmetropolitan transportation plans. Under MAP-21, there are changes to statewide plans and improvement programs (Section 1202). States must now incorporate metropolitan transportation plans and transportation improvement programs without change. A performance-based approach must be integrated into transportation planning, including coordination of performance measures with other planning efforts. Metropolitan transportation planning (Section 1201) proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size. Performance measures and targets need to be coordinated with other planning efforts like the national freight strategic plan. MAP-21 proposes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Each tier has specific technical requirements related to modeling, data, and staffing. Tier I MPOs will have to implement performance-based planning and targets, while Tier II requirements will be more discretionary. Regulations for these requirements must be issued by the Secretary within a year of enactment. MAP-21 proposes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. The Secretary will issue regulations establishing minimum requirements for Tier I MPOs, including performance-based planning and targets. Tier II MPOs will have more discretionary requirements, possibly including performance measures. Both tiers can select projects from their TIPs with the concurrence of the facility owner. MAP-21 also suggests designating MPOs only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more. MAP-21 proposes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. MPOs in urbanized areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population may be terminated unless reaffirmed by the MPO, governor, and approved by the Secretary. The intent of MAP-21 is to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region. The proposed legislation under MAP-21 and H.R. 7 aims to establish two tiers of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) based on population size. MPOs in areas with less than 200,000 population may be terminated unless reaffirmed by the MPO, governor, and approved by the Secretary. The legislation also allows for the co-existence of multiple MPOs in an area if deemed appropriate by the governor and existing MPO. Additionally, H.R. 7 includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the Department of Transportation. H.R. 7 mandates the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the Department of Transportation, including a list of projects of national significance from states. It also requires a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highways and public transportation, with states reporting annually on their progress. H.R. 7 mandates a national performance management system for highways and public transportation, including state reporting on progress towards performance targets. It also requires the identification of projects of national significance in statewide transportation planning, measures to address congestion at airports and freight rail corridors, and consideration of intercity buses in reducing congestion and energy consumption. H.R. 7 addresses congestion issues in airports, freight rail corridors, and ports. It includes planning considerations for intercity buses to reduce congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. The bill also involves regional transportation planning organizations in project selection and proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000. H.R. 7 proposes to increase the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000 and adds a requirement for metropolitan planning to consider intercity buses. Budgetary pressures have raised concerns about efficient resource use in transportation projects. Project delivery speed and the federal government's role in the process are key focus areas in both House and Senate proposals. The House and Senate proposals aim to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. This process involves preparing documentation to identify and consider potential project-related impacts on the environment. During the preliminary engineering and design stage, documentation and analysis are prepared to identify project-related impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. Compliance with state, tribal, or federal requirements is ensured, which may involve obtaining permits or mitigating project effects on historic sites. Various environmental requirements may apply to transportation projects. Environmental requirements, including obtaining permits and mitigating project effects on historic sites, apply to transportation projects. NEPA mandates documentation, analysis, and review for federal-aid highway or transit projects to consider environmental impacts before proceeding. Approval from FHWA or FTA is required before final design activities or project construction can proceed. The NEPA process requires federal agencies to identify and consider environmental impacts before approving final design activities or project construction. DOT policy mandates that all environmental investigations and reviews be coordinated as a single process. Compliance with environmental requirements must be reflected in the NEPA document to expedite the environmental review process. Recent legislative efforts aim to streamline environmental reviews. Recent legislative efforts, such as SAFETEA and TEA-21, focus on expediting environmental reviews for major highway and transit projects. The House proposal in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 goes beyond NEPA compliance to make sweeping changes to the environmental review process, aiming to expedite project delivery by altering existing requirements. The House proposal in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aims to expedite project delivery by making sweeping changes to the environmental review process beyond NEPA compliance. The proposed changes may accelerate environmental reviews but could also potentially slow project delivery by removing coordination mechanisms or adding requirements to the process. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 focus on the environmental review phase of transportation project development, which involves identifying and documenting compliance requirements under NEPA. Before project activities can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure completion of the environmental review process, which may involve input from federal, state, or tribal agencies. Compliance with NEPA may require an environmental impact statement for projects with significant impacts. Before final design activities, property acquisition, purchase of construction materials, or project construction can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure that the environmental review process for the project is complete. This process, under NEPA, includes preparing an environmental impact statement for projects that may significantly affect the environment. Projects with unclear environmental impacts must undergo an environmental assessment to determine significance. Projects with no significant environmental impacts are categorically excluded from preparing an EIS or EA and are referred to as categorical exclusions (CEs). DOT's NEPA regulations outline two groups of actions that are generally CEs, some requiring no additional approval and others that may be processed as CEs with proper documentation and approval from DOT. Since 1998, about 90% of FHWA-approved highway projects annually were processed as categorical exclusions (CEs), while approximately 6% required an environmental assessment (EA). These projects, deemed to have no significant environmental impact under NEPA, may still be subject to other environmental laws. The most significant changes in the environmental review process in MAP-21 involve \"Accelerated Decisionmaking\" and \"Review of Federal Project.\" The changes in the environmental review process under MAP-21 include new requirements for issue resolution and financial transfer provisions to ensure timely project completion and dispute resolution. Under Section 1313 of MAP-21, financial transfer provisions would be established for agencies failing to issue or deny required approvals. The provisions entail transferring $10,000 or $20,000 weekly to expedite decision-making on applications, with exceptions for delays not caused by the agency. The transfer provisions under Section 1313 of MAP-21 require agencies to transfer funds weekly to expedite decision-making on applications for permits, licenses, or approvals. The transfer is triggered 180 days after an application is complete or after a final project decision is made, pursuant to NEPA. Various agencies, such as EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, may be responsible for issuing approvals for DOT projects. These agencies may process numerous permit applications annually for various regulated activities. The agencies responsible for issuing approvals for DOT projects may process hundreds of permit applications annually for various regulated activities. Under-staffing or lack of funds in these agencies can cause delays in issuing necessary approvals or permits. Redirecting limited agency funds to expedite a single transportation project approval may inadvertently slow down other applications being processed. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements initiated after 2005 to those initiated before 2005. MAP-21 requires DOT to prepare assessments comparing completion times of environmental documents initiated after 2005 to those before 2005. The assessments must be reported to Congress within one year of enactment, but no specific funding is authorized for this task. Determining completion times accurately may be challenging as start and end dates of individual documents may not reflect the overall process duration. The assessments comparing completion times of environmental documents initiated after 2005 to those before 2005, as required by MAP-21, may be challenging due to lack of specific funding. Little data is available for projects processed with EAs or CEs, and state DOTs generally do not track the time it takes to complete the NEPA process. Extracting accurate information about NEPA process completion times may be difficult, and DOT may require states to start tracking this information to meet Congress's directive. The NEPA compliance process is a subset of project development, and accurate information on completion times may be hard to obtain. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to track this information. MAP-21 provisions involve changes to regulatory requirements for CEs, including the addition of new projects to the list of CEs through state agency suggestions. The most significant provisions applicable to CEs involve Programmatic Agreements and Additional Categorical Exclusions, directing DOT to survey state agencies for new CE suggestions and adding projects to the regulatory list. Other provisions specify DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for designating specific projects within existing highway right-of-way as categorical exclusions. Provisions in the proposed legislation include specifying DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for designating projects within existing highway right-of-way as categorical exclusions. It also continues environment-related programs established under SAFETEA, such as providing assistance to affected state and federal agencies for expediting transportation project planning and delivery. The proposed legislation includes provisions for using federal transportation funds to support activities that expedite transportation project planning. It also allows states to use funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities and makes permanent a program for states to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. The legislation allows states to use federal transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities under \u00a71307. It also makes permanent the \"surface transportation project delivery pilot program\" for states to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. Additional environment-specific provisions under MAP-21's Subtitle C reinforce the importance of activities DOT is implementing and clarify requirements for NEPA compliance. The House bill includes provisions that would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. It proposes that NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or where federal funding is 15% or less of total project costs. The House bill proposes significant changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, including raising the cost threshold for NEPA applicability to projects over $10 million or with federal funding over 15% of total costs. It also outlines modifications to the NEPA compliance process, such as altering project alternatives, document formats, evaluation levels, and establishing timeframes for permits and approvals. The House bill proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal projects, including raising the cost threshold to over $10 million. It also outlines modifications to the compliance process, evaluation levels, and timeframes for permits and approvals. The bill includes provisions for parks, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and historic sites. The Senate has agreed to substitute language from MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348, including the environmental streamlining provisions from H.R. 7. This ensures that the House streamlining provisions will not be challenged as out of scope. MAP-21 would make three main changes to existing law to speed up project delivery, including allowing state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. MAP-21 proposes changes to speed up project delivery by allowing state DOTs to enter into construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) contracts. This contract method combines design and construction tasks, enabling the contractor to start construction before design work is complete, thus expediting project delivery. H.R. 7 allows state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, accelerating project delivery by starting construction before design work is complete. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods. MAP-21 introduces innovative project delivery methods and technologies for highway projects, such as prefabricated bridge elements and digital modeling. It also includes a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects, limited to five states. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" allows advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects, potentially speeding up the removal of people from the project right-of-way. This program is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. Under Section 1113 of MAP-21, the CMAQ program would be re-written to provide funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants. The EPA sets air quality standards for pollutants like ozone and carbon monoxide. The Clean Air Act directed the EPA to set air quality standards for pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Areas meeting or exceeding these standards are in \"attainment,\" while those not meeting the standards are in \"nonattainment.\" The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. MAP-21 rewrites the CMAQ program to fund projects reducing transportation-related pollutants. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. Under MAP-21, proposed amendments would change how program funding levels are established and distributed within states, with specific annual funding levels no longer authorized. The CMAQ program funding levels have been apportioned to states based on population and pollution levels. MAP-21's CMAQ apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 would be tied to the amount apportioned in FY2009 plus 10% of the apportioned amount to STP funds. Funds would be distributed within each state based on limitations and suballocations. States would need to reserve funds for specific projects. The CMAQ funds apportioned to each state would be distributed based on limitations and suballocations. States would reserve funds for specific projects like transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and providing transportation choices. Half of the remaining funds would be suballocated for projects within designated nonattainment or maintenance areas. The CMAQ funds apportioned to each state would be distributed based on limitations and suballocations, including projects for transportation choices like pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Half of the remaining funds would be suballocated for projects within designated nonattainment or maintenance areas, with funds distributed based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. Additionally, funds would be reserved for purchasing low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. The CMAQ program, established in MAP-21, includes provisions for distributing funds based on population in nonattainment areas for fine particulates. 30% of funds must be used for low-emissions construction equipment. States in attainment for NAAQS can use funds for eligible projects. Proposed Section 149(f) directs prioritization of CMAQ funds for projects reducing pollutants in nonattainment areas. Provisions in MAP-21 may change CMAQ program implementation in states. Proposed sections prioritize funds for projects reducing pollutants in nonattainment areas, evaluate project cost-effectiveness, and allow optional emissions reduction assessments. Proposed changes in CMAQ program requirements include mandatory consideration of emissions reduction assessments by MPOs for project eligibility and the preparation of performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. H.R. 7 also includes provisions amending project eligibility requirements to promote alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The House bill provisions under Section 1108 would amend project eligibility requirements to promote alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits and non-tax incentives. Non-tax incentives for alternative fuel vehicles include credits under the CAFE program and access to HOV lanes. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend this access, but also impose limits if vehicles cause lane degradation. The House and Senate bills aim to limit states' authority to exempt electric vehicles from HOV lanes if the lanes become degraded, regardless of the cause. Additionally, the bills propose using highway funds for new charging stations and amending the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include alternative fuel buses. The House and Senate bills propose using highway funds for new charging stations at parking facilities and amending the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include alternative fuel buses and zero emission buses. MAP-21 would allocate funds for clean fuel buses and facilities, with a focus on reducing carbon and particulate emissions. The Senate's public transit provisions in the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7, on the other hand, would rename the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. The bill eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue collected in FY2012 to the highway account. Additionally, $40 billion from the general fund would be transferred to the alternative transportation account. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 includes significant restructuring of the federal transit program, replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a State of Good Repair Grant Program. The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and introduces the State of Good Repair Grant Program to replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. This new program includes a High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit. Funding for the program would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and be distributed by a new formula based on vehicle miles and route miles. The State of Good Repair Grant Program includes funding for fixed guideway systems, motorbuses, and buses. Funding sources vary, with distribution based on vehicle miles and route miles. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program, funded by the mass transit account, would distribute competitive grants for bus upkeep. $75 million would be set aside from the New Starts program. The FPTA proposes combining certain formula programs and eliminating the discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program. The Bus-Related Facilities program receives almost $1 billion per year and is combined with other formula programs. The Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program are merged into the Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program is integrated into the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. The Access to Jobs program requires recipients to allocate 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments to projects aiding low-income individuals in commuting to work. The Senate bill integrates the Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program into the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. It also renames it as the Access to Jobs program, requiring recipients to allocate 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments to projects aiding low-income individuals in commuting to work. Additionally, the bill creates two new programs, the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, funded from the Non-Urbanized Area funds. The emergency relief program provides funding for capital and operating costs in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. The House bill (H.R. 7) authorizes a new Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, similar to the Highway Emergency Relief Program, to provide funding for disasters. It doubles the funds for transit on Indian reservations to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. The bill eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others, but largely maintains the federal transit program structure. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes distributing $20 million by formula and $10 million competitively for transit funding. It eliminates programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others, maintaining the current federal transit program structure. Funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program would now be distributed by formula, focusing on providers of bus transit in urbanized areas without heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail services. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes significant changes to transit funding, including distributing funds by formula and incentivizing contracting out bus services. It also allows private intercity and charter operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make substantial changes to the New Starts program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to transit funding, including lowering the cost share for contracted services and allowing private operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make significant changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process to three stages. The bill proposes changes to the New Starts program, reducing stages from four to three and eliminating the alternatives analysis requirement. Project development phase requires application to the Secretary of Transportation and initiation of the NEPA process. Project sponsor must provide project justification and local financial commitment information. Engineering phase can begin after completion of the NEPA process. The project sponsor must provide project justification and local financial commitment information to the Secretary for review. Once the NEPA process is completed with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion, the project can enter the Engineering Phase. Successful projects can then move into a full funding grant agreement with the Secretary for federal funding assistance and proceed to the construction phase. The Senate bill also aims to expedite projects with special warrants for projects with a federal share of $100 million. The Senate bill aims to advance projects quickly with special warrants for projects with a federal share of $100 million or less. It would eliminate the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. Additionally, the bill includes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain new fixed guideway capital projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) aims to expedite project delivery for certain new fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects costing $250 million or less. It maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts. The bill eliminates the alternatives analysis but requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. Special warrants are included to speed up projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) allocates $150 million for Small Starts projects and includes provisions to expedite project delivery. It eliminates alternatives analysis but requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. Changes in project justification criteria include adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors. H.R. 7 includes private contributions and intermodal connectivity as evaluation factors, along with infrastructure costs and land use. It allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use a percentage of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more with 100 buses or fewer in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. Additionally, it permits the use of Urbanized Area formula funds for operating expenses in high-unemployment urbanized areas for up to three years, with varying allowable amounts each year. H.R. 7 allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more with 100 buses or fewer in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. It also increases the share of formula funds for Americans with Disabilities Act paratransit from 10% to 15%. H.R. 7 proposes a 50% federal cost share for transit agencies in urbanized areas of 200,000 or less and nonurbanized areas. It also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15%. The bill includes provisions for passenger and freight rail, calling for a national rail plan and regional rail plans to guide future investments. The bill calls for the development of national and regional rail plans to guide future investments, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor. States may also create state rail plans to refine the regional plan. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, requiring Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service. DOT is required to develop guidance within one year of enactment. The bill makes amendments to the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor. It also mandates DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays, conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and report on track access arrangements within two years. Additionally, the bill promotes the development of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill requires DOT to survey and report on track access arrangements for intercity passenger rail operating on other railroads' tracks. It also promotes the development of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services, creating a corporate entity controlled by Amtrak and states to manage the equipment pool. Amtrak and states would be eligible recipients for the capital grant program for corridor passenger service. The equipment pool aims to achieve economies of scale but may discourage innovation in car design. The bill promotes standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services, with Amtrak and states eligible for capital grants. The equipment pool aims for economies of scale but may hinder car design innovation. Positive train control could impact domestic car design regulations, potentially aligning them with foreign standards. The implementation of positive train control could lead to modifications in U.S. passenger car design regulations to align with foreign standards, potentially facilitating a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program, which aimed to reduce congestion on high-priority rail corridors. Amtrak's congestion grant program, part of the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program, lacked funding in FY2011 and FY2012. H.R. 7 would also reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants and amend laws regarding food and beverage service on trains. H.R. 7 would amend laws regarding food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and allowing for subsidized service based on competitive bidding. The Senate bill proposes changes to laws governing Amtrak's food and beverage service, federal grant programs for relocating railroad lines, and the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program. It also includes modest changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board. The Senate bill proposes changes to laws governing the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program, including accepting state or local subsidies as collateral and expanding eligible uses of loans. It also includes modest changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board, such as raising the ceiling on freight charge relief and imposing shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases. The bill proposes changes to rate case procedures, increasing rate relief limits, imposing shorter deadlines for complex cases, studying railroad asset replacement costs, compiling and reporting railroad service complaints, reviewing agency staffing needs, repealing a capital grant program for smaller railroads, and facilitating access to the RRIF loan program. H.R. 7 proposes changes to rate case procedures, increasing rate relief limits, and studying railroad asset replacement costs. It also mandates positive train control (PTC) for passenger and freight railroads on routes carrying toxic-by-inhalation products. Railroads have raised concerns about the high cost of implementing PTC. Railroads carrying toxic-by-inhalation products must install Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, which uses radio signaling to prevent accidents. The Senate bill allows for deadline extensions until December 31, 2018, if implementation is deemed infeasible. PTC implementation can also be funded through RRIF and requires a spectrum study. The House bill (H.R. 7) extends the PTC deadline. The Senate bill allows for deadline extensions for Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation until December 31, 2018, if deemed infeasible. PTC can be funded through RRIF and requires a spectrum study. The House bill (H.R. 7) extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and eliminates the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. Railroads have the option to implement equivalent safety measures and adjust technology installation routes. Highway safety programs fall under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), with the Senate bill retaining existing grant programs and creating an incentive grant program to discourage texting and cell phone use while driving. The Senate bill would create an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. It also aims to increase awareness of motor vehicle defect reporting and raise the maximum civil penalty for safety violations. Additionally, starting in 2015, passenger vehicles must be equipped with event data recorders. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes consolidating multiple highway safety grant programs into one general program with reduced funding. Both the House and Senate bills would establish a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results for commercial drivers to prevent them from avoiding penalties by switching employers. The Senate bill also includes measures to discourage texting while driving and increase awareness of motor vehicle defect reporting. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants in FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. Both bills create a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results by commercial drivers to prevent penalties for failed tests. They also address \"reincarnated carriers\" and provide funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. Questions about state oversight of transit safety arose after fatal rail transit incidents in 2009 and 2010. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants in FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. It addresses concerns about state oversight of transit safety following fatal rail transit incidents in 2009 and 2010. The transit safety section in MAP-21 would authorize DOT to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in 2010 proposed a bill to authorize DOT to establish and enforce safety standards for rail transit systems, create a safety certification program, and ensure state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. The bill would allocate at least $10 million for state grants to implement the program and prioritize safety and state of good repair projects for federal urbanized area formula grant funds. H.R. 7 proposes funding for state grants to implement a rail transit safety program, prioritizing safety and state of good repair projects. It would not authorize DOT to set safety standards but would allow funds to be spent on safety projects first. The bill also includes provisions for certifying state safety oversight organizations and providing financial assistance. Additionally, it authorizes $440 million annually for transportation research and education. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 would authorize funding for transportation research and education, with MAP-21 allocating $400 million annually and H.R. 7 allocating $440 million annually. They both include provisions for a technology deployment program and prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. MAP-21 also includes a competitive grant program for ITS deployment and grants for university transportation centers, while H.R. 7 focuses on state grants for rail transit safety programs and state safety oversight organizations. Both bills direct the Department of Transportation to conduct studies on various aspects of transportation improvement. DOT will conduct studies on improving transportation, safety, lifecycle cost analysis, reducing congestion, assessing infrastructure investment needs, and financing options. MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize grants for transportation research. Both bills emphasize the need to fully spend revenues from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund on waterside infrastructure maintenance. Congress currently appropriates only half of the cargo tax collected for this purpose. House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language that would require the total level of budgetary resources provided for a fiscal year to equal the level of receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. This provision would restrict the use of funds to harbor maintenance programs."
