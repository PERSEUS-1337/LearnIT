    "content": "The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, calling for reducing greenhouse gases. Despite various actions taken, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions in 2001. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through legally binding commitments by developed countries. The US climate change policy under his administration focused on voluntary initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions, with only a few regulatory programs in place to achieve energy or environmental goals that inadvertently reduced emissions. In 2002, the UNFCCC summarized over 50 programs, with only six being regulatory. These programs aimed to achieve energy or environmental goals, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress focused on improving monitoring of emissions and enacting market-oriented reduction programs. In the 109th Congress, bills aimed at reducing greenhouse gases were introduced, focusing on improving monitoring of emissions, enacting market-oriented reduction programs, and implementing energy-related initiatives like renewable portfolio standards. This report compares two proposals from the Senate's debate on H.R. 6, The Energy Policy Act. The report compares two proposals from the Senate's debate on H.R. 6, The Energy Policy Act of 2005, focusing on reducing greenhouse gases through market-based mechanisms and encouraging innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies. Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced S. 342, the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005, and S. 1151, an expanded version with additional provisions for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. S. 1151, introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman, aims to reduce greenhouse gases through market-based mechanisms. The bill includes provisions for innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation. It requires economy-wide emission reductions and allows participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs to meet reduction targets. S. 1151, defeated on a 38-60 vote, would mandate economy-wide emission reductions through a market-based strategy. The bill allows participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs to achieve reduction targets, excluding residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases. Senator Bingaman's draft amendment is based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's recommendation for a mandatory, tradeable permit program to limit greenhouse gases. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman is based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's recommendation for a mandatory, economy-wide tradeable permit program to limit greenhouse gases. It mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy, with a 2.4% annual reduction between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation would be through a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity through a market-oriented allowance trading program. Covered entities can choose to make payments to the DOE instead of reducing emissions, with an initial price of $7 a ton in 2010. This differs from S. 1151, which places an absolute cap on emissions. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity through a market-oriented allowance trading program. It includes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" and differs from S. 1151 by not placing an absolute cap on emissions. The draft amendment proposes reducing greenhouse gas intensity through an allowance trading program with a cost-limiting \"safety valve.\" It differs from S. 1151 by not setting an absolute cap on emissions and allows covered entities to purchase extra allowances or make payments to the DOE. Other differences include coverage of entities, primary agency responsibility, generation of credits, and utilization of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. The draft amendment proposes an allowance trading program with a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" to reduce greenhouse gas intensity. It differs from S. 1151 in various aspects, such as not setting an absolute cap on emissions and allowing covered entities to purchase extra allowances. Emission reduction estimates for both options have some uncertainty, with the draft amendment showing more variability. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed S. 1151 in 2004, estimating a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. CRS's estimate for the draft amendment was a 2.5% reduction in emissions by 2010. Long-term projections were not made due to uncertainty, but both options were expected to slow emissions growth compared to business-as-usual scenarios. EIA analyzed S. 1151 in 2004, estimating a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. CRS did not estimate longer term reductions from either S. 1151 or the draft amendment due to uncertainty. Both options were expected to slow emissions growth compared to business-as-usual scenarios. The draft amendment could lead to emissions rising faster than under S. 1151 due to economic growth outpacing reduction targets and increased costs driving entities to use the safety valve. The projected emissions under the draft amendment show potential for faster growth compared to S. 1151. The sources for the data include submissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and projections from the Energy Information Administration. The estimates for emission reductions under the draft amendment are more uncertain compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment's estimated emission reductions are more uncertain than S. 1151 due to uncertainties surrounding the number of covered entities. Higher coverage means more reductions but lower compliance costs, while lower coverage means lower costs but greater uncertainty. The draft amendment calculates future emission reductions based on projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement, which introduces uncertainties. Economic growth projections range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case assumption of 3.1%. The draft amendment calculates future emission reductions based on uncertain projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. Economic growth is assumed to range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case set at 3.1%. Carbon intensity is estimated at 165 million metric tons carbon equivalent per million dollars GDP, but could be as low as 159MMTCE/M$GDP according to the President's Climate Change Initiative. The draft amendment raises questions about coverage and uncertainty in achieving emissions reductions. The estimated carbon intensity in 2002 was 183MMTCE/M$GDP, higher than projected under the initiative. There is uncertainty about entities not covered and the safety valve triggering a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide. The draft amendment raises uncertainty about coverage and achieving emissions reductions. Analysis shows a $7 per ton safety valve could be triggered immediately or around 2015. Future growth in greenhouse gas emissions adds to uncertainty in achieving reductions. The projected cost under the draft amendment is more uncertain than under S. 1151. The projected cost under S. 1151 is uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. S. 1151 establishes a firm cap on emissions based on 2000 levels, requiring offsets for any increased emissions from economic growth. More emission reductions likely mean higher costs, while less robust economic growth would result in fewer reductions and lower costs. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are also affected by other uncertainties, with studies showing potential permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain and influenced by various factors. Studies show potential permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010, with differing estimates based on assumptions about energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. Restricting options in a market-based allowance trading system can increase projected costs. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to factors compared to S. 1151. It incorporates economic growth into emissions limitations, allowing for future emission increases if economic growth exceeds greenhouse gas intensity improvements. This results in lower costs due to fewer required offsets. The draft amendment incorporates economic growth into emissions limitations, allowing for future emission increases if economic growth exceeds greenhouse gas intensity improvements. This results in lower costs due to fewer required offsets. Unlike S. 1151, the draft amendment does not extend its flexible market program to international credits, eliminating uncertainty and potential lower costs from international trading. The draft amendment does not extend its flexible market program to international credits like S. 1151, eliminating uncertainty and potential lower costs from international trading. The National Commission on Energy Policy projected a permit price of $5 a ton in 2010 for the draft amendment, with a safety valve limiting upside risk to $7 a ton. This safety valve narrows the potential costs substantially, with remaining uncertainty on the lower bound of costs. The draft amendment sets a projected permit price of $4.8 - $5.9 a ton in 2001 dollars, with a safety valve to limit costs. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. Market-based mechanisms, such as tradeable permit programs or carbon taxes, set limits on emissions or costs while allowing the marketplace to determine the actual value or reduction. The preference for a specific system depends on one's view of cost uncertainty and benefits. The preference for a pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of a safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received. If confident in achieving a specific level of CO2 reduction with significant benefits, a tradeable permit program may be most appropriate. This allows for efficient handling of costs through permit trading, concentrating emission reduction efforts at least cost sources. However, if more concerned about potential control costs to the economy, including a safety valve may be preferred. Including a safety valve in emission reduction efforts can help cap the marginal cost of control for affected entities, but the exact level of CO2 reduction achieved becomes less certain. Emitters would spend money controlling emissions up to the safety valve level, but the overall emissions reductions cannot be accurately forecast due to the unknown marginal cost of control among millions of emitters. The safety valve on emission reduction efforts helps cap the cost of control for emitters, but the exact level of CO2 reduction achieved is uncertain. The draft amendment could be seen as a contingent carbon tax, posing a policy question on economic costs and emission reduction goals. S. 1151 focuses on total emissions, while the draft leans towards price control. S. 1151 and the draft amendment propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions with trading allowed, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. Both aim to reduce emissions below business-as-usual levels, but S. 1151's reductions are expected to be larger and more certain. The draft amendment proposes a market-based system to limit greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on emissions intensity and establishing a cost-limiting safety valve. It is expected to have lower and more predictable costs compared to S. 1151, which aims for larger and more certain emission reductions. Both proposals would result in lower U.S. emissions compared to business-as-usual scenarios, but total emissions would still increase, albeit at a slower rate."
