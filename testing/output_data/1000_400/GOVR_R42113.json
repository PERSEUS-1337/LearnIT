In contrast, overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. The corporate tax revenue has declined over time, currently generating around 1.3% of GDP. In contrast, overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Payroll tax revenue has increased from 1.4% to 6.0% of GDP, while excise tax revenue has decreased from 3.1% to 0.5% of GDP. The individual tax now accounts for 41.5% of federal revenue, payroll tax for 40.0%, and corporate tax for 8.9%. The decline in corporate tax revenue may be due to a reduction in tax rates, a decrease in the tax base, or both. Various factors such as the number of firms operating as corporations and corporate profitability can impact the tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenue may be due to a reduction in tax rates and the corporate tax base. Factors such as the number of firms operating as corporations and corporate profitability can impact the tax base. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, contributing to lower tax revenue. The effective tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower corporate tax revenue. This decline is driven by a reduction in the top statutory rate and other factors affecting the tax base. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from around 50% in the 1950s and 1960s to 35% currently. This reduction is influenced by the statutory tax rate specified in the Internal Revenue Code, special tax credits, deductions, and other benefits. Additionally, the investment tax credit and Section 199 deduction have further lowered the effective corporate tax rate below the statutory rate since 2004. Since 2004, corporations have been able to claim the Section 199 deduction for certain activities, reducing the effective corporate tax rate. Changes to depreciation rules also contributed to lower effective tax rates, with enhancements like \"bonus depreciation\" in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reversed the trend of rapid capital recovery by aligning tax depreciation with physical depreciation. Bonus depreciation was temporarily enhanced in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and corporate tax credits have had small effects on effective corporate tax rates. Despite overall decreases, recent spikes in effective tax rates are shown in Figure 2. The effective corporate tax rate has fluctuated over time due to factors like accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. Recent spikes in the average effective rate occurred around 2000 and 2007 during recessions when businesses were experiencing losses. These losses can be carried back to offset previous income, reducing the average effective rate for firms. The carrying back of losses allows businesses to offset income from previous years, reducing their average effective tax rate. However, during recessions, a two-year carryback period may not be sufficient for firms to fully utilize losses, leading to higher taxes. Congress extended the carryback period to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. Lower effective tax rates are not the sole reason for the decline in corporate tax revenue, as the nonfinancial corporate tax base has also shrunk. In response to the decline in corporate tax revenue, Congress extended the carryback period from two years to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. The nonfinancial corporate tax base has shrunk as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to the corporate income tax system. The distribution of business income in the United States has shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations, leading to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. This change is also reflected in the distribution of businesses, with C corporations accounting for a smaller percentage of all businesses by 2007. The shift in business income from C corporations to S corporations has led to a smaller corporate tax base and a decrease in corporate tax revenues. The popularity of S corporations increased after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, with S corporations representing 12% of businesses by 2007, up from 4% in 1980. This change in business structure, along with a reduction in profitability, has further impacted the tax base. Legislation increased the S corporation shareholder limit from 35 to 100, making the S corporation form more attractive. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has decreased, affecting the tax base. The profit to asset ratio measures how well the corporate sector is utilizing its resources to generate profits. The profit to asset ratio summarizes how well the corporate sector is using its resources to generate profits. Corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966, with economists attributing this decline to various factors. The decline in corporate profitability since 1966 has been attributed to factors such as a shift to more volatile industries, younger firms being less profitable, and potential profit shifting to lower-tax countries. The decline in corporate profitability since 1966 has been attributed to factors such as a shift to more volatile industries, younger firms being less profitable, and potential profit shifting to lower-tax countries. Younger firms are generally less profitable than older firms in the initial years, which would drive down overall profits relative to assets. American corporations could be shifting profits out of the United States and into lower-tax countries, which would lower profits reported domestically. The profit measure used is based on income reported for tax purposes, leading to a decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to factors such as a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate, a shift towards pass-through business structures not subject to corporate income tax, and a decline in corporate sector profitability. Corporate tax revenues have been declining due to factors like a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate, a shift towards pass-through business structures not subject to corporate income tax, and a decline in corporate sector profitability. The corporate reform discussion focuses on reducing statutory rates and achieving revenue neutrality through broadening the tax base by eliminating deductions, exemptions, and credits. Reducing statutory rates and achieving revenue neutrality by broadening the tax base through eliminating deductions, exemptions, and credits, and shifting to a territorial tax system. Research suggests reducing the top corporate rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making reforms to business taxation. As the corporate rate is reduced, some business activity may return to the corporate sector, naturally broadening the base. Reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would involve repealing corporate tax expenditures, changing tax preferences for noncorporate businesses, and other business tax reforms. This may lead to some business activity shifting back to the corporate sector, broadening the tax base. Additionally, reforms to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas could help reduce profit shifting to low-tax countries, expanding the domestic corporate tax base. The section also explains the calculation of average effective tax rates and provides data sources for the variables used in the calculation. The text provides an overview of the mathematics behind calculating average effective tax rates. Table A-1 shows data sources for variables used in the calculation. Equations for average effective tax rates are explained, with superscripts indicating government levels."
