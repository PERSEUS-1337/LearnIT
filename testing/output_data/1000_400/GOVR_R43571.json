    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific professions or occupations. Currently, there are over 50 federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs available. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been available since 1958, offering borrowers the chance to have their student loan debt forgiven in exchange for service in specific fields. Currently, there are over 50 federal programs authorized, with approximately 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. These programs involve the federal government forgiving or canceling a portion of a borrower's total student loan debt upon meeting certain requirements, such as completing a period of employment in public service. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are offered by the federal government to forgive, cancel, or discharge a portion of an individual's student loan debt in exchange for meeting certain requirements, such as completing a period of employment in public service or specific occupations. These programs aim to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter or remain in high-need professions and locations, as well as to offer debt relief to borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter or remain in high-need professions or locations. They offer debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who choose to enter public service or specific occupations, or repay their loans through an income-driven repayment plan. Other forms of debt relief may also be available in certain circumstances. Repayment benefits provide debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or specific professions, or repay through an income-driven plan. Other forms of debt relief include loan discharge for disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, defense to repayment, and bankruptcy discharge. Loan forgiveness options include discharge for closure of the borrower's school, false certification of student eligibility, loans made without authorization, unpaid refunds, defense to repayment, and bankruptcy discharge. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957, was one of the earliest federal student loan forgiveness programs. The NDSL program was established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957. Congress funded improvements in education programs to address national security concerns. Low-interest loans were made available to college students, with a student loan forgiveness component for those who taught full-time in public schools. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957, included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in public schools. Eligible individuals teaching in schools with low-income students or students with disabilities could have up to half of their student loans cancelled. Loan forgiveness benefits were also extended to those serving in Head Start programs or in the Armed Forces. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957, included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in public schools, with benefits extended to those serving in Head Start programs or in the Armed Forces. The program was later incorporated into the Higher Education Act of 1965 and renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs were subsequently established for borrowers in other professions and high-need areas. The Federal Perkins Loan Program was established in 1965 with a loan forgiveness component for teachers, later expanded to include other professions. Additional federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were created, such as the Health Professions Student Loan Program, with over 50 programs currently in existence. This report identifies and describes these federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. The report identifies and describes over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. The program descriptions provide policymakers with general information on the purpose and operation of these programs. Comprehensive details can be found in additional resources such as federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law, each designed to provide debt relief to borrowers through specified service, professions, locations, or income-driven repayment plans. These programs have unique characteristics and eligibility criteria. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law, each with unique characteristics and eligibility criteria. These programs offer benefits such as loan forgiveness, cancellation, or repayment based on specified service, professions, locations, or income-driven repayment plans. The programs vary in terms of borrower eligibility, benefit amounts, funding sources, and means of providing benefits. This overview aims to broadly characterize the authorized programs using consistent parameters to highlight similarities and differences between them. In federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers must meet specific criteria to qualify for benefits such as loan forgiveness or repayment. These programs vary in eligibility, benefit amounts, and funding sources. The use of consistent parameters helps to compare the programs effectively. Loan forgiveness programs require borrowers to repay according to an income-driven plan for a specified period to qualify for benefits. At the end of the term, some or all of the qualifying student loan debt is forgiven. The availability of benefits may be entitlement-based or discretionary, depending on the program administration and funding. Loan forgiveness programs provide benefits to qualified borrowers based on specific eligibility criteria outlined in loan terms and conditions. These benefits are considered entitlements funded through mandatory appropriations. Loan forgiveness programs offer benefits to eligible borrowers based on specific criteria outlined in loan terms. There are two main categories of loan forgiveness: for public service employment and income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs also provide debt relief for specific functions, professions, or locations. Loan repayment programs offer loan forgiveness for public service employment and income-driven repayment. These programs provide debt relief for specific functions, professions, or locations by directly repaying some or all of the borrower's student loan debt or funding a separate entity for repayment. Loan repayment benefits are separate from federal student loan programs and aim to address employment needs or help federal agencies recruit and retain employees. Loan repayment benefits are offered through separate programs from federal student loans, designed to address employment needs or help federal agencies recruit and retain employees. These benefits are discretionary, subject to fund availability, and may incur federal income tax liability. The types of debt relief programs vary in their tax implications. Forgiveness under employment-focused programs is tax-exempt, while forgiveness under income-driven repayment or public service employment may incur federal income tax liability. The three categories of debt relief programs examined in this report include loan forgiveness for public service employment, loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service employment. Federal student loans may be eligible for inclusion in federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs cover federal student loans made through Title IV of the Higher Education Act, Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. Eligible loans for these programs are typically federal student loans from HEA or PHSA programs. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administer federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs for federal student loans made through HEA or PHSA programs. Private education loans may also be eligible for some programs. Federal student loans are currently only made through the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV. Loans are currently only made through the Direct Loan program under Title IV, previously also through the FFEL program and the Federal Perkins Loan program. In the Direct Loan program, loans are government-funded and administered by ED, while in the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders. Loans were made through the Federal Perkins Loan program and the Direct Loan program under Title IV. In the Direct Loan program, government-funded loans are administered by ED, while in the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders. Loan origination, servicing, and collection were handled by federal contractors in the Direct Loan program, while nonfederal lenders were responsible for these tasks in the FFEL program. Nonprofit guaranty agencies managed federal loan insurance and loan forgiveness benefits. Loan types in both programs had similar borrower terms and conditions, but differed in availability of loan forgiveness benefits. During the period when the FFEL and Direct Loan programs operated, loans were made through two sets of loan types with similar borrower terms and conditions. Differences included availability of loan forgiveness benefits. In the Perkins Loan program, institutions of higher education served as lenders and were responsible for originating, servicing, and processing loan cancelation benefits. The Perkins Loan program involved institutions serving as lenders responsible for originating and servicing loans. The Direct Loan program offers Subsidized Loans to undergraduate students with financial need, with the government covering interest charges during certain periods. The government subsidizes Direct Subsidized Loans by not charging interest while the borrower is enrolled in an eligible academic program. Borrowing limits apply, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans totaling $21.5 billion were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to students regardless of financial need and can be used to cover portions of the student's cost of attendance. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. The borrower is responsible for paying all accrued interest, with the option to defer payments until the loan enters repayment status. Borrowing limits apply, with 8.1 million loans totaling $49.8 billion made in FY2017. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct PLUS Loans were made, with no explicit borrowing limits. These loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students, and can cover expenses not met by other financial aid sources. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan, including various loan types like Direct Loans, FFEL program loans, and other federal student loan programs. This feature is important for loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine different loan types, such as LDS, NSL, and HEAL, into a single loan. This enables borrowers to access loan forgiveness and repayment benefits. Direct Consolidation Loans have a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, including Perkins Loans for undergraduate and graduate students. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, with Perkins Loans available to undergraduate and graduate students. Perkins Loans have a fixed interest rate of 5% per year, with interest not accruing before repayment begins. Borrowers in public service may have their Perkins Loans cancelled for each year of service. Additionally, in FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782,230 million were made. In FY2017, HRSA made 20,849 loans totaling $162.8 million to health professions students through five loan programs. One of these programs offers low interest rate loans to students pursuing degrees in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 6,842 loans totaling $64.2 million. The HRSA offers low interest rate loans to full-time students pursuing degrees in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine. In FY2017, HRSA estimated making 6,842 loans totaling $64.2 million for this program. The HRSA offers need-based, low interest rate loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine. Recipients must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice in that field for 10 years. Loan recipients who do not meet the service requirements must repay their loans at a higher interest rate of 7%. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million to students pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine. The program provides low interest rate loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and is administered by individual schools selecting eligible students who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million for nursing students pursuing various degrees. The program provides low-interest rate loans to financially needy students who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. Additionally, HRSA estimated making 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million for registered nurses completing graduate studies to become qualified nursing school faculty. Nursing schools administer the program and select participants for loans, with the possibility of loan forgiveness. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program provides loans to nursing students pursuing advanced degrees. HRSA estimated making 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million in the 2016-2017 academic year. The HEAL program, phased out between 1995 and 1999, supported students in various healthcare fields. The HEAL program provided loans for students pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields, but new loans are no longer being issued. Borrowers are still responsible for repaying existing HEAL program loans. In addition to federal student loan programs, students can also obtain loans from private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and institutions of higher education. Private student loans, also known as alternative loans, are offered by nonfederal entities such as banks, credit unions, state-supported programs, and institutions of higher education. The terms and conditions of these loans are determined by the lender. While not part of federal loan programs, some federal repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers of certain private education loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers. Some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers of private student loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers by satisfying specific criteria and program characteristics. The report outlines three categories of debt relief programs and qualifying criteria for borrowers, along with program components for comparison. The report outlines three categories of debt relief programs and qualifying criteria for borrowers, along with program components for comparison, including types of qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, debt relief amounts and timing, and exclusions or limitations on benefits. Loan forgiveness entitlement programs are presented first due to their potential scale. See Appendix A for program-specific details. This section presents primary categories of debt relief programs in order of potential availability to borrowers. It starts with loan forgiveness entitlement programs, followed by programs for public service and income-driven repayment plans. Next are programs for broad public service or employment needs, limited to specific individuals and smaller in scale. Lastly, programs for public service in government employment, targeting agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations, specific employers, or public service. These benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and potentially available to many borrowers. Loan forgiveness for public service employment offers debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or employers. Benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and available to many borrowers. Table 1 summarizes various forgiveness programs based on employer and occupation requirements, as well as economic circumstances during repayment. Table 1 summarizes forgiveness programs based on employer and occupation requirements, as well as economic circumstances during repayment. Benefits are available to borrowers in specific occupations or employers, with no specific requirement. Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria, such as completing a specific service or entering a particular occupation. Programs are listed by the scale of benefits offered. The scale of benefits available to borrowers for loan forgiveness programs is illustrated in Table 1. Eligibility criteria must be met, such as completing a specific service or entering a particular occupation. Programs are widely available to teachers, with Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation also open to law enforcement personnel and public defenders, and Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness available to those employed in public service. Borrowers of these programs may work in federal, state, local, tribal government agencies, or certain nonprofit organizations. Loan forgiveness programs are available to individuals in public service occupations, including law enforcement personnel and public defenders. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of time, ranging from 1 to 10 years. Income-driven repayment options provide debt relief based on income proportion. These benefits are entitlements for borrowers of federal student loans. Repayment plans offer debt relief to borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but haven't fully repaid their debt. These entitlements are included in federal student loan terms and are available to a wide range of qualified borrowers. Unlike programs for public service employment, these plans are not limited in availability. Table 2 summarizes loan forgiveness programs linked to income-driven repayment, organized by eligibility start dates. The text provides a summary of various loan forgiveness programs that offer debt relief to individuals following income-driven repayment. The programs are widely available to borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications, with details organized by eligibility start dates. Unlike programs for public service employment, these loan forgiveness programs are not limited in availability. Table 2 shows that loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment are widely available to borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications. These programs do not have specific employer, occupational, or service requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20 to 25 years, with payments based on factors like loan debt, family size, and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. Loan forgiveness programs for federal student loans require borrowers to make monthly payments based on factors like loan debt, family size, and income for 20 to 25 years. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Public service employment can also provide debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or employers. Employment offers debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or public service. These benefits help meet employment needs, recruit qualified employees, and serve as additional compensation. Loan repayment programs are limited and not entitlements, subject to fund availability. Loan repayment programs for specific occupations or public service offer debt relief benefits to qualified borrowers, subject to fund availability. These programs are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs and are designed to meet employment needs and recruit qualified employees. Table 3 summarizes the various repayment programs available, highlighting eligibility criteria based on employer and occupation. The table in Table 3 summarizes repayment programs available based on employer and occupation eligibility criteria, organized by operational status and administering department or agency. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs do not group data by availability scope or financial resources. Table 3 illustrates various employment needs addressed by 19 broad-based loan repayment programs, with 15 targeting health-related occupations, including healthcare provider shortages and faculty needs. Other targeted occupations include legal and large animal veterinarians. Loan repayment programs target health-related occupations, including healthcare provider shortages and faculty needs. Other targeted occupations include legal and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers may work for multiple employers but some programs require service in underserved areas. Participants must serve for a minimum period of time. Loan repayment programs require borrowers to serve in specific geographic locations for a minimum period of time, generally between one and five years. These programs are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs, potentially being the smallest in scale compared to other loan repayment and forgiveness programs. Information on the scale of these programs, such as the number of benefit recipients and amount of benefits received, is not readily available. Loan repayment programs are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs, potentially being the smallest in scale compared to other programs. Information on the scale of these programs, such as the number of benefit recipients and amount of benefits received, is not readily available. The Office of Personnel Management reports on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program, highlighting various loan repayment programs offered by federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. The curr_chunk discusses loan repayment programs offered by federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. It outlines the eligibility criteria, including repayment benefits availability, occupational requirements, and economic circumstances assessment. The programs are organized by operational status and administering department. Unlike other loan forgiveness programs, these programs are not grouped by potential availability or financial resources. Table 4 displays federal agencies' loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. There are 25 programs, with 8 specifically for Armed Forces members. Benefits vary by agency and occupation. Several federal agencies offer loan repayment programs to recruit and retain employees, with 8 programs specifically for Armed Forces members. Benefits vary by agency and occupation, with service commitments generally between one and five years. Loan repayment programs are available to agency employees in certain fields, with service commitments typically lasting between one and five years. Eligibility for benefits can be based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Loan repayment programs offer benefits based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Borrowers may qualify if they come from a disadvantaged background or if their expected monthly loan payment exceeds a certain percentage of their income. Programs vary in the amount of loan forgiveness or repayment benefits provided and the schedule for distributing those benefits. Loan repayment programs provide benefits to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds or those with high monthly loan payments. These programs offer various levels of loan forgiveness or repayment benefits, with three primary methods used to determine eligibility. Benefits can include forgiving the entire loan balance, repaying a specified dollar amount or percentage of the loan. Some programs forgive the entire outstanding student loan amount after a certain number of payments. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans by requiring a certain number of payments towards the balance. Employers may also provide repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount or a percentage of the outstanding loans. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer varying flat rates or percentage payments towards outstanding loans. Restrictions may apply, such as ineligibility for borrowers in default or limitations on receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. Borrowers must often be U.S. citizens to qualify for these programs. Certain federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions that prevent borrowers who have defaulted on their loans from receiving benefits. Some programs also prohibit individuals from benefiting from multiple programs for the same service. Additionally, borrowers may face financial penalties if they do not complete their term of service. Many federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions on multiple benefits for the same service. Some programs require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Certain programs are only available for specific types of loans, such as federal student loans under the Higher Education Act. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as the PSLF program, are restricted to U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, and eligible noncitizens. Availability of benefits may be limited for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans, depending on the program and loan characteristics. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, teacher loan forgiveness is generally not available for defaulted loans. In some loan forgiveness programs, benefits may be restricted for borrowers in default. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, defaulted loans may not be eligible for teacher loan forgiveness. However, borrowers who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements may still qualify for loan forgiveness. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers with defaulted loans that have not been accelerated may qualify for forgiveness under the same terms as non-defaulted borrowers. Borrowers with accelerated defaulted loans may qualify for forgiveness based on service performed before the acceleration date. In federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers with defaulted loans that have not been accelerated may qualify for forgiveness on the same terms as non-defaulted borrowers. Clawback provisions may require beneficiaries to repay the unearned portion of benefits or the full amount received, plus interest, and potentially punitive fees. Some clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness programs may require participants to repay the unearned portion of benefits, the full amount received plus interest, and potentially punitive fees. Student loan debt forgiven or repaid on a borrower's behalf is generally included in gross income for federal income taxation, but some exceptions exist where forgiveness benefits may be excluded from income tax liability. Student loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation under certain conditions, such as specific authorizing statutes or meeting requirements in IRC Section 108(f). Loans forgiven or repaid must have been used for attending a qualified educational institution. Loans forgiven or repaid for attending a qualified educational institution may be excluded from gross income under certain conditions outlined in IRC Section 108(f), including specific authorizing statutes and eligibility criteria for loan forgiveness programs. Loans forgiven or repaid for attending a qualified educational institution may be excluded from gross income under certain conditions outlined in IRC Section 108(f). Specific types of lenders, including federal and state governments, must have made the loan. Exclusions are also provided for programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs eligible under the Public Health Service Act. If loan forgiveness or repayment benefits are not excluded by statute or do not meet IRC Section 108(f)(4) requirements, individuals are responsible for paying any associated income tax liability. However, some loan forgiveness programs offer supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Several loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide supplemental funds to borrowers to offset tax liability incurred from discharged loans. Recipients can avoid significant taxation by excluding these benefits from gross income. However, debates arise on the effectiveness of these programs in encouraging borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Researchers question the impact of these programs on individuals' decisions. Debates surround the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in incentivizing borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Key issues include whether individuals would enter these fields without debt relief, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief encourages students to take on more loans for education. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in incentivizing borrowers to enter specific fields or government service is debated. Key issues include whether debt relief influences individuals' career choices and if it encourages students to take on more student loans. The cost of these programs to the federal government relative to the benefits received is also a consideration. The discussion on the effectiveness and costs of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs focuses on whether these programs influence individuals' career choices and if recipients would have engaged in qualifying service without them. Evaluations comparing career paths of program beneficiaries with those without access have not been widely conducted, but data from the National Institutes of Health's program may provide insights. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and compared them with similar individuals who did not receive loan repayment. Individuals receiving loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue conducting medical research at the NIH than those who did not. The NIH found that individuals receiving loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue medical research at the NIH and in general. The program may be meeting its goals, but other factors also influence individuals' decisions to stay in targeted positions. The loan repayment program at NIH may not be the sole reason individuals stay in targeted positions. Other factors like career interests and job availability also play a role. Loan repayment incentives are more effective when job opportunities are abundant. In recent years, law school graduates facing limited private sector opportunities may opt for public interest or government jobs. While some individuals may have taken a job without loan repayment benefits, evidence shows that in some cases, participants would not have accepted a position without loan repayment incentives. For example, a study found that healthcare providers in rural areas would still practice there even without a loan repayment award. Loan forgiveness or repayment programs may seem unnecessary, but evidence shows that participants are more likely to accept a position with such benefits. For instance, the NIH found that recipients of loan repayment awards had competing job offers and viewed the potential for loan repayment as a unique and attractive benefit. This was especially true for physicians who often had higher-paying job offers. Physicians who received loan repayment were also more likely to stay in research at the NIH, indicating that loan repayment can be a valuable recruitment and retention tool for federal agencies. However, some aspects of program design may hinder its effectiveness. Loan repayment benefits are effective at recruiting and retaining staff at federal agencies like the NIH. However, some program design aspects may reduce effectiveness, such as uncertain funding leading to uncertain availability of benefits. Job applicants may not know if they will receive a loan repayment award until after accepting a job, and the award amounts may not be sufficient incentives for certain professions. Loan repayment programs may struggle to determine incentives for job applicants as the award amounts may not be sufficient for certain professions. Researchers suggest that financial benefits should offset borrowing costs to be successful. Additionally, program design elements like tax responsibilities can affect the attractiveness of the benefits. Some loan repayment programs may not offer sufficient incentives due to factors like tax responsibilities and short-term benefits, leading to potential turnover among participants. Loan repayment programs may lead to turnover as individuals may change jobs once they receive full benefits. There is a concern that these programs may not incentivize individuals to stay in their current positions. Researchers question if student loan debt is the main factor influencing employment decisions for loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs assume student loan debt heavily influences career choices, but research shows factors like compensation and geographic location also play a significant role. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians practicing in specific areas, addressing deterrents beyond just debt. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs consider student loan debt as a factor in career decisions, but other factors like compensation and geographic location also influence choices. For instance, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians practicing in specific areas, addressing deterrents beyond debt. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide financial incentives for individuals to enter lower-paying fields like primary care medicine, but the amount received may not fully compensate for the lifetime earnings gap between primary care physicians and specialty physicians. One study estimated that over a lifetime, the average primary care physician earns $3.5 million less than a specialty physician. High levels of debt influence job choice, leading graduates to opt for higher-paying positions to offset their financial obligations. The author found that high levels of law school debt often lead recent graduates to work at large law firms for higher earnings. Similarly, undergraduates with higher debt levels tend to choose higher salary jobs over education-related fields, government agencies, or nonprofit organizations. Some studies suggest that law school debt plays a secondary role in career choices, with demographic characteristics being a more dominant factor. Law school debt levels may have a secondary role in career choices, with demographic characteristics being more influential. Loan repayment programs may not significantly impact career decisions for law school graduates. There is a question about whether debt relief programs encourage students to take on more student loans for their education expenses. Debt relief programs like IDR plans and PSLF offer open-ended student loan forgiveness after capped payments based on income. Critics argue that these programs may lead students to borrow more for education expenses. Debt relief programs like IDR plans and PSLF offer loan forgiveness based on income, not amount owed. Monthly payments are limited to a portion of discretionary income, and forgiveness of the entire outstanding balance is possible after meeting certain conditions. Critics argue that tying payments to income may encourage over-borrowing and make students less sensitive to the cost of education. The PSLF program offers loan forgiveness after 10 years of repayment in public service, leading to costs for the government. These costs include loan subsidy, appropriated program, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal student loan terms. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have three categories of costs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. These programs are part of federal student loan terms, with benefits incorporated into federal direct loans and loan guarantees. Loan subsidy costs are funded through mandatory appropriations under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program funded through mandatory appropriations. The budgetary costs of direct loans and loan guarantees are measured based on their estimated long-term costs to the government. The federal budget reflects the subsidy cost of loans and administrative costs separately. The federal budget reflects the costs of providing loan subsidies and administrative expenses for direct loans and loan guarantees. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, minus the cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive cost indicates a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a return. Loan forgiveness benefits are included in loan programs' terms and conditions. Loan forgiveness benefits in direct loan or guaranteed loan programs increase loan subsidy costs. For example, Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers discharges a portion of borrowers' loan balance, relieving them of repayment responsibility. This results in increased costs for the government. Loan Forgiveness to Teachers is a benefit available to qualified borrowers where a portion of the loan balance is discharged by the government, relieving borrowers of repayment responsibility. This increases loan subsidy costs for the program. Other similar programs include Public Service Loan Forgiveness and forgiveness after the maximum repayment period. The cost of loan forgiveness benefits is included in loan subsidy costs for the fiscal year when the loan was issued. Programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and forgiveness after the maximum repayment period are examples. Funding for loan repayment programs comes from appropriations in the fiscal year when benefits are provided, either through discretionary or mandatory funding. Loan repayment benefits are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year when benefits are provided, either through discretionary or mandatory funding. Examples include the GESLR program and the JRJ Loan Repayment program. Funding availability may limit benefits to eligible borrowers. The Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique as they are specified in the terms of Perkins Loans and granted by the institution that issued the loan. Unlike most federal credit programs, Perkins Loans are not funded through federal appropriations. The Perkins Loan program offers loan forgiveness benefits specified in the loan terms, granted by the institution. Unlike federal credit programs, Perkins Loans do not receive federal funding. Institutions absorb costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the government. Cancellation reimbursements in FY2009 have not been funded, leaving institutions to cover the costs of canceled Perkins Loans for eligible borrowers. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are typically funded separately from programmatic costs. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately from programmatic costs. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Loan repayment programs are administered by various agencies with different funding mechanisms. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of these programs. Variation exists in how administrative costs are funded for ED programs. Limited information is available on the actual costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Estimates are often used for future projections of forgiven loans. Loan repayment programs provide more detailed information on benefits provided. Cost estimates for unrealized loan forgiveness programs are discussed. In loan forgiveness programs, data on benefits provided and recipients is available. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a cost estimate of $1.5 billion over five years was projected. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program estimated a cost of $1.5 billion over five years, with $1.2 billion associated with loans made before FY2008. The Revised Pay-As-You-Earn repayment plan estimated that approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible, with 2 million expected to enroll. In the 2015 Final Regulation, the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan estimated that around 6 million borrowers would be eligible, with 2 million expected to enroll, costing approximately $15.4 billion.

In the 2015 Final Regulation, the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan estimated that around 6 million borrowers would be eligible, with 2 million expected to enroll, costing approximately $15.4 billion. The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) repayment plan estimated that approximately 1.67 million borrowers would opt for the plan, with around 400,000 receiving loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment. Borrowers receiving forgiveness had an average original loan balance of $39,500, with an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven due to paying only interest under the PAYE plan. In the 2012 NPRM, ED estimated that 1 million borrowers from 2014-2021 cohorts would choose IBR plan, with 126,000 borrowers from FY2009 cohort and 146,000 from FY2012 cohort opting for IBR plan. 44,000 borrowers from FY2009 cohort and 52,000 from FY2012 cohort would have some loan debt forgiven after 25 years. Loan forgiveness benefits are relatively new, and receipt and amounts are contingent. The availability of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs is a topic for Congress to explore. Questions arise about the optimal policy and whether changes are needed. Issues include whether multiple programs should offer forgiveness or repayment benefits for similar borrower activities. The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of existing federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Key issues include whether multiple programs should provide benefits for similar borrower activities and if the current structure leads to financial windfalls. Additionally, the assessment of program effectiveness and potential overlap between programs are important considerations. The federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap if multiple programs serve the same purpose or if the same borrower receives benefits from different programs for the same service performed. This could lead to unnecessary administrative costs and potential qualification for benefits under multiple programs. The federal government may be spending money on administrative costs for overlapping student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Recipients could potentially qualify for benefits from multiple programs, leading to the possibility of receiving benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed. An individual working in a federal agency may receive up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program (GESLRP) and qualify for forgiveness of the remainder of their student loan debt after 10 years of service with a federal agency and 120 monthly payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF). This could result in receiving benefits from two programs for the same federal government service. Multiple programs may also be available to the same groups of individuals, leading to overlapping administrative costs for similar programs. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase qualified nursing faculty by providing repayment benefits to individuals serving as nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. Both programs are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) grants money to nursing schools for their own loan repayment programs, creating an administrative burden on the HRSA. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that offer double benefits or serve the same purpose for the same group of individuals. The NELRP administers and grants money to the NFLRP for the same group of individuals and purpose. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields, but may also benefit those who would have entered regardless. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields, but concerns have been raised about individuals borrowing larger amounts than necessary, especially under non-need-based PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Some concerns have been raised about individuals borrowing large amounts under non-need-based PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students, potentially leading to excessive borrowing due to the possibility of loan forgiveness. Congress may need to consider setting limits on forgiveness amounts. Research suggests that some individuals may choose certain fields even without loan forgiveness incentives. Loan forgiveness programs aim to attract skilled employees to specific occupations. Some individuals may choose certain fields regardless of loan forgiveness incentives. Loan repayment programs may be ineffective in immediately placing individuals in specified occupations but somewhat effective in retaining skilled employees. Congress could improve programs by implementing more specific funding controls. Loan repayment programs may be somewhat effective in retaining skilled employees, as reports suggest they play a role in individuals' job choices. Congress could enhance programs by implementing more specific funding controls, such as defining eligibility criteria more narrowly or directing fund usage through appropriations measures. Insufficient data are available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. In general, federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs lack sufficient data to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for many programs, with some data only becoming available once borrowers apply for benefits. For example, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program requires borrowers to remain employed in a public service job for 10 years before becoming eligible for forgiveness benefits, with little known about the actual forgiveness benefits received under the program. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who remain employed in public service jobs for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments. Little is known about the forgiveness benefits received under the program. Borrowers may not be required to document their employment. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods, but data collection on participants is limited, making it difficult to verify program outcomes. Improved data collection and reporting are essential for assessing program effects and determining if program design changes could enhance effectiveness. There is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief across different programs. Some programs have specific eligibility criteria, such as certain loan types or amounts, for debt relief. Some student loan debt relief programs have specific eligibility criteria, such as certain loan types or amounts, while others have fewer limitations. Consideration should be given to imposing additional restrictions on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for forgiveness and repayment programs. Consideration should be given to imposing limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt eligible for forgiveness and repayment programs, especially with the increase in non-need-based loan aid like PLUS Loans for graduate students. Concerns have been raised about students over-borrowing due to the availability of these programs. Should students be allowed to borrow non-need-based federal loans for expenses covered by their expected family contribution and then have a significant portion forgiven through loan repayment programs? In the absence of federal loan forgiveness programs, individuals may borrow non-need-based federal student loans to cover expenses typically met by their expected family contribution (EFC). Questions arise about setting limits on qualifying student loan debt for forgiveness and repayment programs. Selection criteria for agencies administering these programs vary, with some agencies not offering repayment programs at all. The GESLRP allows federal agencies to run their own student loan repayment programs, with 34 agencies providing benefits in CY 2016. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse benefits if they don't complete their service. Employees in certain positions are ineligible, but agencies can decide who receives benefits. The GESLRP allows federal agencies to run their own student loan repayment programs, with participants required to serve for at least three years and repay benefits if they do not complete their service. Certain positions are ineligible for benefits, but agencies have the discretion to determine recipients. Different agencies have varying eligibility criteria, making it challenging for participants to understand. The GESLRP allows federal agencies to customize their loan repayment programs, with participants serving for at least three years and repaying benefits if they do not complete their service. However, variations in eligibility criteria across agencies make it difficult for participants to discern requirements. The program may only attract individuals to work in a limited number of agencies, leading to challenges in attracting qualified individuals to the federal government.
