The Congress finds that expanded access to credit has led to high homeownership rates, but some lenders engage in predatory practices, making it costly for low-income families. Borrowers with fair credit can get prime loans with low rates, while those with poor credit get subprime loans with higher rates and fees. Predatory lending in the mortgage market involves high interest rates, excessive fees, and unfair terms, particularly affecting minority neighborhoods and stripping away wealth accumulated over decades. Predatory loans with unjustifiably high interest rates, excessive fees, and unreasonable terms have grown rapidly in minority neighborhoods, stripping away wealth accumulated over a lifetime. Cash-poor homeowners in underserved communities are often victimized by lenders offering high-interest home equity loans with hidden fees, leading to struggles in meeting mortgage payments. The joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Treasury urged Congress to adopt legislation to curb predatory home mortgage lending by restricting abusive terms, improving consumer disclosures, and prohibiting harmful sales practices.

The report also proposed a four-point plan to address predatory lending practices, including requiring lenders to recommend home mortgage counseling, disclose credit scores to borrowers, and provide timely and accurate information on loan costs and terms. The government agencies are involved in addressing predatory lending issues to reduce lenders using high-pressure sales techniques and misleading borrowers.
