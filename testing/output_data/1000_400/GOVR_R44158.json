    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure and environmental impacts. Water withdrawals and consumption are key measurements of irrigation water use. The primary measurements of irrigation water use are water withdrawals and consumption. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. It is uncertain if this decline has resulted in reduced water usage. Since 1980, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. The decline in withdrawals may not necessarily lead to reduced water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003, while several eastern states have significantly increased irrigated acres. Since 2003, irrigated land in the United States has varied by region. Four western states saw an increase in irrigated acres, while the rest saw a reduction. In contrast, several eastern states, including Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, saw a significant increase in irrigated acres. Farmers have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation since the 1980s, especially in 17 western states. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres, while applied irrigation water declined by over 1.37 million acre-feet from 1984 to 2013. Since 1984, gravity irrigation in the West has decreased significantly, with a shift towards pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. Despite a small growth in irrigated acres in the West, applied irrigation water has declined. Groundwater withdrawals have increased, while overall irrigation withdrawals have decreased. Eastern states have seen a notable increase in irrigated acres compared to the West. Groundwater withdrawals for irrigation have increased by over 740,000 AF since 2003, with the highest withdrawals in the western United States. In the East, irrigated land has grown by over 8.7 million acres since 1984, primarily using groundwater. This trend is attributed to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to low-cost groundwater, leading to environmental concerns due to declining aquifer levels. The increased irrigated acres in the East, totaling 4.3 million AF since 2003, are due to factors like higher commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to groundwater. This has led to concerns about declining aquifer levels and environmental impacts. Irrigation efficiency is defined as the percentage of applied water beneficially used without evaporation or seepage, influenced by factors like irrigation system performance and crop response to water. Climate conditions also play a role in determining irrigation efficiency. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors like evapotranspiration rates, water conveyance systems, and crop water requirements. Climate conditions impact evapotranspiration rates, which determine the crop water requirement. Poorly constructed irrigation canals can lead to conveyance losses. While efficient systems aim to leave water in the hydrological system for downstream use, some studies suggest they may increase water consumption. Efficient irrigation systems aim to reduce conveyance losses, but studies show they may increase water consumption. Increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation can lead to higher water consumption and crop yield. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter typically consumes less water. Efficient irrigation systems may increase water consumption despite reducing conveyance losses. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but gravity irrigation usually consumes less water due to water return through runoff and deep percolation. Adopting efficient irrigation technologies could lead to growing more profitable, water-intensive crops. Efficient irrigation systems may not necessarily reduce overall water consumption as they may encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure systems and gravity systems, with precision technologies increasingly being used to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in modern irrigation systems. Precision technologies are increasingly used in modern irrigation systems to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Best management practices for irrigation focus on water management on farms, including conveyance, scheduling, and application methods. These practices are based on select practices identified by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service. Not all irrigation technologies are considered best management practices, and their success depends on various factors. Pressure systems for irrigation involve pumping water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops using sprinklers or perforated pipes. They are divided into sprinkler systems, which use high- to medium-pressure to spray water, and microirrigation systems, which use low-pressure to apply water directly. Some BMPs listed can apply to both pressure and gravity systems, while others are specific to one type. Success of BMPs depends on various factors and may require multiple practices. For a more extensive list of BMPs, refer to Appendix B. Pressure irrigation systems, including sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are commonly used in the United States, making up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems. These systems are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used to grow most crops. While operational labor requirements are low, initial investment costs can be high. Pressure irrigation systems, such as sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used for most crops. These systems require intentional preparation to manage water application, reduce soil erosion, maximize plant growth, and increase water efficiency. Irrigation BMPs may include microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, land leveling, and tailwater recovery. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation are common types of pressure irrigation systems. Pressure irrigation systems, such as sprinkler and microirrigation systems, maximize plant growth, lower energy consumption, and increase water efficiency. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for adequate soil moisture. Microirrigation, a more efficient method, applies water directly to the root zone of crops. Microirrigation systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation are highly efficient methods that apply water directly to the root zone of crops. This enhances standard center pivot irrigation systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems. In contrast, gravity irrigation systems divert water to flood over crops through land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. LEPA systems reduce evaporation losses and energy consumption by applying water directly into circular furrows. Gravity irrigation systems, comprising 35 to 42% of US irrigation systems, use land-forming measures to flood crops. Controlled flooding methods like basin, border, and furrow irrigation increase efficiency, while uncontrolled flooding does not. These systems are generally less efficient than pressure systems, with varying initial costs and labor requirements. Gravity systems are suitable for close-growing crops like rice, while furrow irrigation can be used for row crops like potatoes and corn. Irrigation land leveling ensures uniform water application to crops. Land leveling is reshaping a field to ensure uniform water application without puddles or dry spots. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss during transit to the crop area. Canal linings increase conveyance efficiency based on soil type. Irrigation ditch lining is a method to limit water loss in canals or ditches. It can be made from materials like concrete, PVC, or polypropylene. Tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water from irrigation, while irrigation reservoirs store water for use. A tailwater recovery system can be built to prevent water contamination and convey water back for reuse in irrigation. Irrigation reservoirs store water for irrigation, with their size depending on water availability. Precision technologies like satellite data and drones have improved irrigation efficiency and crop yield. The incorporation of precision technologies in agriculture, such as satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones, has increased irrigation efficiency. Technology companies are offering services to help farmers maximize profits. A collaborative project between NASA and USDA launched the SMAP satellite to gather soil moisture data globally. The SMAP satellite, launched by NASA and USDA, collects global soil moisture data using radar and a functioning radiometer. This data can help governments and agricultural producers make informed decisions about irrigation. Drones can also be used for aerial imagery and data collection, which can be combined with software to adjust irrigation practices. Sensor networks monitor plant water status and soil water content. Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) are utilized for aerial imagery and data collection, which can be combined with software to adjust irrigation practices. Sensor networks monitor plant water status, evapotranspiration, and soil water content. Data analytics uses real-time data to improve decisions on energy consumption and environmental conditions for irrigation system automation. Regional weather networks track crop evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture data to establish an accurate irrigation schedule. Remote monitoring systems wirelessly transfer real-time information for irrigation adjustments. The implementation of irrigation BMPs can increase efficiency by creating precision for water application, reducing production costs. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation uses computer software to optimize hole sizes, decreasing water usage and runoff. Remote monitoring systems transfer real-time information for irrigation adjustments, reducing field visits and overall water applied. Poly-pipe is a flexible plastic pipe made from polyethylene resins that expand when full of water. Computer software optimizes hole sizes for poly-pipe, decreasing water usage and irrigation runoff. Implementing irrigation BMPs can increase efficiency, reduce production costs, and ensure even watering. Irrigated yields are roughly double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing for higher value crops and extended growing seasons. Specialty crops benefit from irrigation BMPs by receiving water only when needed, reducing costs and preventing issues from overwatering. Irrigation BMPs enhance production of higher-value specialty crops by allowing water to flow only when needed, reducing costs and preventing issues from overwatering. The controlled environment of an irrigation system also allows for the application of nutrients and pesticides, reducing costs and providing more precise application. Implementation choices for irrigation technologies in the United States are influenced by factors such as cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and water quality. Some irrigation BMPs allow synthetic nutrients and pesticides to be mixed with irrigation water for more precise application and cost reduction. Implementation choices for irrigation technologies in the United States are influenced by factors such as cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and water quality. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems by agricultural producers is often driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation, with higher costs of efficient systems leading growers of high-value crops to adopt drip irrigation systems first. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems by agricultural producers is driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation. Growers of high-value crops were among the first to adopt drip irrigation systems due to the higher costs of efficient systems. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, some growers cannot finance irrigation system improvements, and high-efficiency systems like micro sprinklers can be more costly than gravity systems. Agricultural producers also consider the cost of developing a water supply when selecting an irrigation system. High-efficiency irrigation systems, such as micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip, can be more expensive than gravity systems like furrow irrigation. Agricultural producers also factor in the costs of developing a water supply, which can include drilling wells and operating pumps. The cost of establishing a water supply from groundwater is generally higher than surface water, influencing the adoption of efficient pressure systems in areas heavily reliant on groundwater. High-efficiency pressure systems are more common in areas heavily reliant on groundwater due to the higher cost of extracting groundwater compared to surface water. Growers in drought-prone areas are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems, with the type of crop also influencing the choice of irrigation method. Perennial tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay, while close-growing crops like rice typically require gravity irrigation. Recent survey data shows that many farmers in the United States are unable to utilize more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type and local climate conditions. For example, high-pressure sprinklers used on perennial tree crops can lead to fruit decay, making drip irrigation systems more suitable. Close-growing crops like rice typically require gravity irrigation, while widely spaced field crops may not need total field soil saturation. Local climate conditions also play a role, with drip and surface irrigation being more effective in windy conditions and sprinkler irrigation facing high evaporation rates in arid climates. Local climate conditions and soil type are key factors in determining the most suitable irrigation system for crop production. Windy conditions favor drip and surface irrigation over overhead sprinklers, while arid climates pose challenges for sprinkler irrigation due to high evaporation rates. Soil composition also plays a role, with sandy soils requiring sprinkler or microirrigation methods for efficient water distribution. Loam and clay soils can accommodate various irrigation systems, but sandy soils have lower gravity irrigation efficiency. The type of soil in a crop production area is a key factor in selecting an irrigation system. Sandy soils require sprinkler or microirrigation methods due to high infiltration rates, while loam and clay soils can accommodate various systems. Soil surveys help in designing irrigation systems, considering the labor-technology trade-off between pressure and gravity systems. Gravity irrigation can be labor-intensive, while automated sprinkler and drip systems require more technological inputs. The labor-technology trade-off is crucial in selecting an irrigation system. Gravity irrigation is labor-intensive but requires fewer technological inputs, while automated sprinkler and drip systems need more technical knowledge but less labor. Water quality and quantity, as well as soil type, also play a significant role in determining the most suitable irrigation method. Sediment-heavy water is best for gravity irrigation, while sprinkler or drip systems are better for managing salinity and selenium issues. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws largely determine the legal water availability for farmers. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not extensively discussed in this report. For more information, refer to CRS Report. The Clean Water Act indirectly benefits agriculture by addressing water quality concerns in bodies of water. State water rights laws determine the legal water availability for farmers. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers, including support through USDA agencies and conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and Agricultural. Federal funds are provided through conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA to support producers adopting irrigation BMPs. Nearly half of the funding awarded between 2009 and 2014 went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West, particularly California and Texas, received the highest amount of funding for irrigation BMPs. Between 2009 and 2014, $564 million out of $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. California and Texas received the most funding, with other states in the West and Southeast also receiving significant amounts. Groundwater depletion is a concern, with aquifers in the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley being depleted at unsustainable rates. Irrigation efficiency can reduce groundwater recharge and increase aquifer depletion. High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers in the US are being depleted at unsustainable rates. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce groundwater depletion. EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs, CAPs fund irrigation water management plans, and CIG fund local or regional irrigation conservation programs. The EQIP program provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation Best Management Practices (BMPs), including Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs) and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG). The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) also funds irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance. Additionally, the Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program funds similar irrigation BMPs. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs through programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. These programs fund precision technologies and irrigation practices in limited states. Technical assistance is provided through various agencies and programs. The Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program helps irrigators adopt conservation plans by offering technical assistance through a national network of conservationists. While CTA does not provide financial assistance, the plans developed through CTA can help qualify for financial assistance programs. CTA is available to farmers, government units, citizen groups, and consultants.

National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national data on irrigation water use, but comparisons are challenging due to differing methodologies. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national data on irrigation water use through surveys and assessments released every five years. The NASS conducts the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, while the USGS evaluates water use trends, including irrigation. The Interior conducts a water use assessment in the United States every five years, evaluating trends in major categories like irrigation. Appendices detail irrigation technologies and practice codes for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Sprinkler systems are common for pressure irrigation, while microirrigation applies low-volume water near crop roots. Irrigation systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower spray water over crops for soil moisture. They are also used for crop cooling, frost protection, and dust control.

Irrigation water management involves planning efficient irrigation volume, frequency, and application rate to manage soil moisture and promote plant growth. Irrigation scheduling is crucial for water management. Surface and subsurface irrigation systems use earthwork, pipelines, and water-control structures to convey water to irrigated areas.\" Planning efficient irrigation volume, frequency, and application rate is crucial for managing soil moisture and promoting plant growth. Various irrigation systems such as surface, subsurface, ditch lining, tailwater recovery, and diversion dams are used to reduce water loss, erosion, energy use, and maintain water quality. Tailwater recovery facilities capture runoff for reuse, conserving water and improving off-site water quality.
