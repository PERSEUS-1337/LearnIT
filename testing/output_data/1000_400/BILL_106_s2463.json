    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with evidence showing disparities in legal representation and execution rates. Since 1976, African-Americans have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of executions, death row inmates, and victims in death penalty cases.
