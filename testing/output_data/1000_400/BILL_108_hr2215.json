    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This leads to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, with millions of Americans getting sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters. The economic impact of beach closures due to pathogen contamination is estimated at $1 billion. Between 1.8 to 3.5 million Americans get sick annually from swimming in waters contaminated by sewer overflows, leading to significant economic losses and health risks. Improved monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of illnesses each year. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. This definition includes overflows reaching waters of the United States, those that do not, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require owners or operators of treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. The amended Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires owners or operators of treatment works to promptly notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows that could affect human health, notify public health authorities and other affected entities immediately of any overflow posing a health risk, and provide notification within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. The amended Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act mandates water systems to report sanitary sewer overflows that endanger human health promptly. Reports must be provided orally or electronically within 24 hours of awareness and a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause. The owner or operator must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and mitigate impact. Additionally, all overflows must be reported on monthly discharge monitoring reports. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses taken, and actions to prevent future overflows, to the Administrator or State. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, overflow duration, location, responses taken, and actions to prevent future overflows, to the Administrator or State. Additionally, States must report annually to the Administrator a summary of reported sanitary sewer overflows within the State. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nIncreases appropriations to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
