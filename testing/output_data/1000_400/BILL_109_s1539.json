    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section of the Act is also included. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, aiming to provide each child with a permanent home. Despite incentives for adoptions, many children in foster care are still waiting to be adopted, especially older children with special needs. In 2003, over 118,000 children in foster care are waiting to be adopted despite an increase in adoptions. These children have special needs and require financial assistance for healing from past abuse and neglect. SEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to specify criteria for a child to meet requirements for placement with a public or licensed private agency. This includes being in the care of such an agency due to safety concerns in the home and meeting medical or disability requirements for supplemental security. The amended Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act sets criteria for a child to be placed with a public or licensed private agency if staying in the home is unsafe, if the child meets medical/disability requirements for supplemental security, or if the child is in foster care due to safety concerns. The State can remove a child from the home if it is determined to be unsafe for the child's welfare. A child with special needs will have their circumstances considered for adoption payments. Non-US citizen children meeting certain criteria will be treated as meeting adoption requirements. \"A child meeting adoption requirements, including special needs, may receive adoption assistance payments. Non-US citizen children meeting specific criteria will be treated as meeting adoption requirements.\" Children who would be considered eligible for adoption assistance payments under the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, but are not citizens or residents of the United States and were adopted outside of the country, are exempt from receiving payments under the Social Security Act. Children who would be eligible for adoption assistance payments under the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, but are not U.S. citizens or residents and were adopted internationally, are not eligible for payments under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act requires states to use savings from adoption expenditures to provide services to children or families. Additionally, the Act specifies the determination of a child with special needs for adoption assistance. Amendment made by the Adoption Equality Act of 2005 allows for the provision of services to children or families under this part or part B. Section 473(c) of the Social Security Act is amended to define a child with special needs as one who cannot be returned home or meets medical/disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 allows for services to children or families under this part or part B. A child with special needs is defined as one who cannot be returned home or meets medical/disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits. The State must determine specific factors or conditions that make it reasonable to conclude the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without adoption assistance and medical assistance. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 defines a child with special needs as one who cannot be placed with adoptive parents without adoption assistance and medical assistance. Efforts must be made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents before providing assistance. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 states that if a child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without assistance, efforts must be made to find suitable parents before providing assistance. The amendments made by this section will be effective on October 1, 2005."
