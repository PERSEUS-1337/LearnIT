Recent works focus on studying the semantics of the latent space to improve control over the generative process. A new method is proposed in this paper to enhance interpretability by finding meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over properties like object position or scale in generated images. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for encoding simple transformations in generated images. The method introduced in the paper aims to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over properties like object position or scale in generated images. It is weakly supervised and suitable for encoding simple transformations in images, demonstrating effectiveness for GANs and variational auto-encoders. This control is crucial for applications like image in-painting, dataset synthesis, and deep-fakes. An increasing number of applications are emerging for high-resolution photo-realistic images using generative models, such as image in-painting, dataset-synthesis, and deep-fakes. However, control over generated images is often limited. Modifying attributes of generated images can be achieved by adding a learned vector to the latent code or combining latent codes of two images. Studying the latent space of generative models provides insights into its structure, which is valuable for learning unsupervised data. Generative models allow for modifying image attributes by adding a learned vector to the latent code or combining latent codes of two images. Studying the latent space reveals insights into its structure, valuable for learning unsupervised data representations. Images are influenced by underlying factors of variation like objects, positions, and lighting, categorized as modal factors of variation. Images are influenced by underlying factors of variation such as objects, positions, and lighting. These factors can be categorized as modal factors of variation with discrete values or continuous factors of variation with a range of possible values. Describing images using factors of variation is an efficient way to represent natural images, as seen in studies by Berg et al. (2012) and Krishna et al. (2016). In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations. Previous works have limitations in controlling image generation with discrete factors and require labels and an encoder model. In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations such as vertical position, horizontal position, and scale in image generation. The method does not require a labeled dataset or an encoder model and can potentially be adapted to other factors like rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. Our method allows for precise control over factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale in image generation without the need for a labeled dataset or encoder model. It can be adapted to other variations like rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. The effectiveness of our method is quantitatively measured, demonstrating its ability to reveal insights about the latent space structure. The method proposed allows for precise control over factors in image generation without the need for labeled data. It reveals insights about the latent space structure and the impacts of disentanglement on generative models. Optimization in generative models can be challenging due to the complexity of natural image manifold geometry. Disentanglement facilitates control over generative models by allowing easier modification of image properties than obtaining labels. Determining latent codes of transformed images helps find the direction in latent space corresponding to specific transformations. Generative models map latent space Z to image space I, with transformations characterized by continuous parameters. This method enables precise control over image factors without labeled data, revealing insights into latent space structure and disentanglement effects on generative models.

This method enables precise control over image factors without labeled data, revealing insights into latent space structure and disentanglement effects on generative models. The process involves finding a latent code that minimizes reconstruction error between the generated image and the original image, allowing for estimation of the factor of variation described by the transformation. The text discusses using the difference between latent codes to estimate the direction of variation in generative models. The choice of reconstruction error is crucial, with pixel-wise losses known to produce blurry images. Different approaches are needed to address this issue. The choice of reconstruction error in generative models is crucial. Pixel-wise losses like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and cross-entropy are commonly used but can result in blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed to address this issue, but they are computationally expensive. The poor performance of MSE is attributed to favoring the expected value of all possibilities. Further study is needed to understand the effect of MSE on images in the frequency domain. The poor performance of pixel-wise mean square error is due to favoring the expected value of all possibilities. The limited capacity of the generator results in textures being reconstructed as uniform regions, leading to blurry images. In the Fourier domain, high frequencies contribute to the loss, pushing optimization towards solutions with less high frequencies. In the Fourier domain, high frequencies contribute to the loss, pushing optimization towards solutions with less high frequencies. To address this, a loss function is proposed that reduces the weight of high frequencies, allowing for sharper results and more realistic generated images with appropriate texture. The loss function proposed reduces the weight of high frequencies, allowing for sharper and more realistic generated images with appropriate texture. A quantitative comparison to other losses is also provided based on the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Using equation 2, the optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved without using an L 2 penalty on the norm of z. Algorithm 1 involves creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space, parametrized by \u03b4t. Algorithm 1 involves creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space, parametrized by \u03b4t. The input includes the number of trajectories S, generator G, transformation function T, trajectories length N, and threshold \u0398. An auxiliary network can be used to estimate z T for initialization, although training a specific network for this purpose is costly. Training a specific network to initialize the problem is costly. To address slow convergence, the transformation T is decomposed into smaller transformations and solved sequentially. This approach guides optimization on the manifold of natural images in pixel space. Our approach decomposes the transformation T into smaller transformations to guide optimization on the manifold of natural images in pixel space. This method does not require extra training and can be used directly without training a new model. The transformation on an image may lead to undefined regions, which are ignored when computing L. Additionally, generative models may not be able to produce arbitrary images. When applying our method to generate trajectories in the latent space, we discard latent codes with high reconstruction errors to reduce the impact of outliers. This process results in Algorithm 1 for generating transformed images while ensuring they remain within the data manifold. To reduce outliers, high reconstruction error latent codes are discarded when generating trajectories in the latent space. Algorithm 1 is used for this purpose. The model posits that a factor of variation's parameter can be predicted from the latent code's coordinate along an axis. The model predicts a factor of variation's parameter from the latent code's coordinate along an axis. The distribution of the parameter is not known, so a parametrized model is adopted. The model adopts a parametrized model to predict a factor of variation's parameter from the latent code's coordinate along an axis. The distribution of the parameter is unknown, so a model is trained to minimize the Mean Squared Error between the differences in parameters. The model minimizes Mean Squared Error by estimating parameters from latent code coordinates, allowing control over the distribution of generated images. The model allows control over the distribution of generated images by transforming z \u223c N (0, 1) using an arbitrary distribution \u03c6 : R \u2192 R +. This control extends to the dataset used for training, revealing potential bias. Experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites with binary images of shapes and ILSVRC with natural images from various categories. The first dataset, dSprites, consists of 737280 binary 64 \u00d7 64 images with shapes that vary in position, scale, and orientation. The second dataset, ILSVRC, contains 1.2M natural images from one thousand categories. Implementation details include the use of TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model for image generation. The BigGAN model uses a latent vector and a one-hot vector to generate images from specific categories. The latent vector is split into six parts for different scale levels in the generator. Conditional Batch Normalization layers are used to modify the style of the generated image. \u03b2-VAEs were also trained to study disentanglement in generation control. Training was done on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps. Quantitatively evaluating the method on complex datasets is challenging due to the difficulty in directly measuring factors of variation. The \u03b2-VAE architecture used for training on dSprites involved an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps with a batch size of 128 images and a learning rate of 5e\u22124. The analysis focused on factors of variation like position and scale, requiring saliency detection for natural images from the BigGAN model. Saliency detection was performed using a model implemented in PyTorch to extract the barycenter and evaluate scale based on salient pixels proportion. For natural images generated by the BigGAN model, saliency detection is used to create a binary image for extracting the barycenter. The evaluation involves sampling latent codes, generating images, and estimating the factor of variation. An alternative method proposed by Jahanian et al. (2019) uses an object detector for quantitative evaluation of x and y shift as well as scale. The proposed approach allows for quantitative evaluation of position and scale control for generated images using latent space directions. The method is more generic compared to using an object detector trained on specific image categories. Results show precise control over object position and scale for selected ILSVRC categories. The proposed approach allows for precise control over object position and scale for selected ILSVRC categories using latent space directions. Results demonstrate that the directions for factors of variations are shared between categories, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. The latent code in BigGAN is used hierarchically to encode position and scale. The latent code in BigGAN is split into six parts, with spatial factors mainly encoded in the first part. Level 5 contributes more to the y position than the x position and scale. This is shown in Figure 4, along with qualitative results in Figures 2 and 3. The latent code in BigGAN is split into six parts, with spatial factors mainly encoded in the first part. Level 5 contributes more to the y position than the x position and scale. Figure 4 shows the directions of spatial variations, with quantitative results on geometric transformations for training and validation datasets. The algorithm may fail for large scales due to poor performance of the saliency model when the object covers most of the image. The algorithm may fail for large scales due to poor performance of the saliency model when the object covers most of the image. To test the effect of disentanglement on performance, \u03b2-VAE models were trained on dSprites with different \u03b2 values, showing control over object position in the image by moving in the latent space. The study trained \u03b2-VAE models on dSprites with varying \u03b2 values to examine the impact of disentanglement on performance. Results indicated that higher \u03b2 values led to more control over object position in images, showcasing the importance of disentangled representations for precise image generation. The study focused on the impact of \u03b2 values on the control of object position in images generated by \u03b2-VAE models. It highlighted the importance of disentangled representations for precise image generation and the architectural differences between GAN-like models and auto-encoders in providing control over the generative process. Our method for latent representation of images does not require labels, unlike other approaches such as conditional GANs and VAE. InfoGan shows that adding a code to the input of the GAN generator can disentangle the latent space. Our method for latent representation in generative models does not need labels, unlike other approaches. We show that meaningful directions can be found without changing the learning process, focusing on the latent space rather than intermediate activations. Our method focuses on the latent space in generative models, finding latent representations without the need for labels. Previous works have inverted GAN generators to find latent codes by minimizing reconstruction errors between generated and target images. The inversion process of a GAN to find the latent code of an image involves optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error. While previous methods showed success on simple datasets, more complex datasets like ILSVRC pose challenges. The reconstruction loss introduced in Section 2.1.1 improves reconstruction quality significantly, addressing the difficulties of inverting a generative model. White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation in latent space arithmetic to enhance results. The text discusses improving reconstruction quality by addressing the difficulties of inverting a generative model. It also mentions using spherical interpolation in latent space arithmetic to reduce blurriness. Additionally, a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models is highlighted as of high interest in recent works. Recent works on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models have sparked high interest in the community. While similar to other methods, a new approach involves generating a dataset of trajectories before training the model. Evaluation is done using a saliency model, allowing for performance measurement across various categories. Our model allows for precise control over the generative process and can be adapted to more cases. It also explores the impact of disentangled representations on control and the structure of the latent space of BigGAN. Additionally, an alternative reconstruction error for inverting generators is proposed. The main difference identified between our work and others is the model of the latent space used. Generative models are powerful but lack control over the generative process. In this context, a method is proposed to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing for precise control over generated images. A linear subspace of the latent space of BigGAN can be interpreted in terms of intuitive factors of variation. This is an important step towards understanding the representations learned by generative models. The text discusses how a linear subspace of the latent space of BigGAN can represent intuitive factors of variation like translation and scale in generated images. It explores the use of Fourier transform and reconstruction loss to analyze the contribution of high frequency patterns in the generated images. The approach considers modeling the uncertainty of the generator in capturing high frequency patterns by introducing randomness in the phase of the generated image. The text discusses using Fourier transform to analyze high frequency patterns in generated images. The optimization process favors smoother images with less high frequencies. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations in images without supervision. The \u03b2-VAE architecture aims to create interpretable latent representations in images through a simple convolutional VAE design. The decoder network mirrors the encoder with transposed convolutions and dense layers, generating images of size 64x64. The architecture includes Convolution + ReLU and Dense layers with specific filter sizes and units. Results show artifacts when using the proposed loss function without constraining z, with good reconstruction results observed for certain values of \u03c3. The text discusses the reconstruction results using a proposed loss function with and without constraining z. Results show good reconstruction with certain values of \u03c3, and a comparison with classical Mean Square Error and Structural dissimilarity approaches. The accuracy of the reconstruction with the proposed approach is highlighted, along with the importance of restricting z to a ball of radius \u221a d to avoid artifacts. Results are presented with an unconstrained latent code during optimization and the proposed approach. The accuracy of the reconstruction with the proposed method is highlighted, showing that restricting z to a ball of radius \u221a d avoids artifacts. A quantitative evaluation was performed on images from the ILSVRC dataset, showing that reconstructions using the proposed method are perceptually closer to the target image compared to MSE or DSSIM. The LPIPS similarity measure was used to compare reconstructed images to the target image, showing that reconstructions with the proposed method are closer to the target image than those with MSE or DSSIM. The optimization problem is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold, especially for transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling is curved in pixel space. The direction of the shortest path between images in pixel-space is near orthogonal to the manifold for large translations and rotations. This curvature poses challenges during optimization. During optimization of the latent code, the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to the generated image is tangent to the direction of the shortest path between images in pixel-space. This causes a slowdown in optimization when the direction of descent in pixel space is near orthogonal to the manifold described by the generative model. During optimization, the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to the generated image is tangent to the shortest path between images in pixel-space. This can cause a slowdown in optimization when the descent direction in pixel space is nearly orthogonal to the generative model's manifold. In an ideal scenario where the generative model is a bijection between latent space and natural images, moving an object in the image can result in the gradient being orthogonal to the manifold, leading to optimization difficulties. Moving objects in images can lead to optimization difficulties when the gradient is orthogonal to the generative model's manifold. Qualitative examples for geometric transformations and brightness changes are shown using the BigGAN model. Categories chosen produce interesting results for position, scale, and brightness variations. The BigGAN model generates images with variations in position, scale, and brightness. Latent codes are sampled to control these variations, with some categories showing difficulty in controlling brightness due to lack of training data. The direction for position and scale is learned on ten categories, while brightness variations are based on the top five categories."
