The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, involve misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. Financial institutions can be involved in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when used to settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves using the international trade system to disguise the origins of illicit wealth. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, manipulate trade transactions by misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. Financial institutions can be unwittingly involved in TBML and TBML/FT schemes through settling, facilitating, or financing international trade transactions. In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury highlighted TBML as a challenging form of money laundering in their National Money Laundering Risk Assessment. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment identified Trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a challenging form of money laundering. TBML schemes involve manipulating trade transactions to launder billions of dollars annually. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers use TBML, the international financial system, and physical cash movement to disguise their activities. Between January 2004 and May 2009, TBML activities involved transactions exceeding $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the international financial system and cash couriers to conceal their activities. They take advantage of the complexity of the trade and finance system to obscure transactions through various means, including multiple foreign exchange transactions, co-mingling of funds, and exploiting vulnerabilities in financial arrangements for cross-border trade. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves exploiting vulnerabilities in trade financing arrangements, co-mingling legitimate and illicit funds, and using limited customs resources to detect suspicious transactions. Money launderers use techniques like over- and under-invoicing goods and services to obscure the money trail. TBML activities involve misrepresenting the price, quality, or quantity of goods as they cross borders or supply chains. According to FATF, TBML techniques vary in complexity and are often combined with other money laundering methods. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves misrepresenting the price, quality, or quantity of goods as they cross borders or supply chains. TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing goods and services, which is a common method for laundering funds across borders. Invoicing below market value allows funds to be shifted to the importer, while invoicing above market value transfers value from the importer to the exporter. These transactions require collusion and can have significant tax implications. Over- and under-invoicing goods and services in trade-based money laundering involves misrepresenting prices to transfer value between importers and exporters. Collusion is required for these transactions, which can have tax implications. Complex products and supply chains complicate customs officials' ability to determine true market value. Multiple invoicing for the same transaction can justify multiple payments and involve multiple financial institutions, aiding money laundering or terrorist financing. Money launderers and terrorist financiers use various tactics to manipulate goods and services, such as multiple invoicing and over- and under-shipments. These tactics increase the complexity of transactions and make detection more difficult for officials. Collusion between exporters and importers can also be used to misstate prices and quantities, further aiding in money laundering activities. Money launderers manipulate goods and services through tactics like over- and under-shipments and falsely described goods. They can misstate quantities, quality, and types of goods to create discrepancies in values. Collusion between exporters and importers can lead to \"phantom\" transactions, making detection difficult for financial institutions. This can be part of schemes like the Black Market Peso Exchange for laundering drug proceeds from Latin America. TBML involves misstating the quality or type of goods to create value discrepancies, commonly used in schemes like the Black Market Peso Exchange for laundering drug proceeds. TBML is a prevalent form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations, yet it is less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional money laundering through banks. TBML is a common form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations. It is less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional money laundering through banks. TBML can have significant consequences for global trade and government revenue, with the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment highlighting its destructive impact on legitimate commerce. ICE HSI warns that transnational criminal organizations may sell imported goods purchased with illicit funds at a discount to expedite the money laundering process. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment warns that TBML can harm legitimate commerce by allowing transnational criminal organizations to sell underpriced goods purchased with illicit funds, reducing government revenue through tax evasion and fraudulent imports. This activity can hinder entrepreneurship and legitimate economic activity. TBML harms legitimate economic activity by crowding it out and reducing tax revenue. Global trends in trade have been exploited by criminal organizations to hide gains from illegal activities. Organized crime has expanded into new markets following advances in communication, transportation, and digital technology. Organized crime has expanded into new markets following global trends in trade, creating vast new market opportunities. Criminal organizations diversify into profitable activities with low detection risks, leveraging economies of scale and efficiencies common to legitimate trade. The OECD found that criminal groups have adapted to global market trends by engaging in new types of illicit activities to connect production to distant consumers. This illegal trade poses challenges for law enforcement and could have significant economic consequences, including reductions in domestic expenditure and investment in developing countries. The international trade system is both attractive and vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups, with low risk of detection according to FATF. The international trade system is vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups due to its complexity and limited verification procedures. FATF identifies key vulnerabilities including the enormous volume of trade flows, complexity of foreign exchange transactions, comingling of illicit funds with legitimate business, and limited verification procedures for customs data exchange between countries. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is increasing globally, with Mexico and China being the most frequently identified countries involved. Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela also show rapid growth in potential TBML activity. Limited resources and verification procedures in customs agencies contribute to the challenge of detecting illegal trade transactions. Between January 2004 and May 2009, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity was frequently identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. The U.S. Department of State's 2016 report highlighted TBML concerns in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. TBML unrelated to terrorist financing was also noted in the State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) concerns in various countries including Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. TBML is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, corruption of customs authorities, and laundering of proceeds from black market goods. Anecdotal case studies have shown links to known terrorist groups and non-state armed groups. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment concluded that trade-based money laundering (TBML) is not a dominant method for terrorist financing, despite anecdotal cases linking known terrorist groups to TBML. An analysis of U.S. law enforcement investigations since 2001 found that the physical movement of cash and movement of funds through the banking system were the predominant methods for moving money to terrorists and terrorist organizations. Since 2001, U.S. law enforcement investigations have shown that the primary methods of moving money to terrorists and terrorist organizations are through physical cash movement and banking system transfers. Cash movement accounted for 28% of cases, while direct bank transfers made up 22%, licensed MSBs 17%, and unlicensed money transmitters 18%. TBML was identified as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria. In its latest Country Reports on Terrorism, the State Department identified trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria. TBML is used by hawala brokers in conjunction with corrupt customs and immigration officials. Hawala is an informal method for transferring funds commonly used in parts of the Middle East and South Asia where the formal banking system is limited. Hawala transfers involve a network of trusted money brokers who disburse funds to third-party clients on their behalf. Settlement of account balances among hawaladars does not necessarily involve bank or nonbank financial institutions. Hawala transfers involve a network of trusted money brokers who disburse funds to third-party clients in regions with limited formal banking systems. Settlement of account balances among hawaladars does not always involve traditional financial institutions. These informal systems are preferred for their speed, reliability, and lower costs, but are seen as lacking transparency and vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report highlighted specific countries vulnerable to trade-based money laundering and terrorist financing schemes. The State Department's 2016 report identified specific countries vulnerable to trade-based money laundering and terrorist financing schemes, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. U.S. law enforcement discovered money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities used to purchase vehicles in the United States, potentially linked to Hezbollah. In a TBML scheme involving trade in vehicles co-mingled with weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah, U.S. law enforcement identified money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States. The purchased vehicles are exported to Lebanon and Jordan, sometimes with hidden weapons. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations. The vehicles in TBML schemes are sent to unknown destinations, potentially funding Hizballah in Lebanon. Paraguay's Tri-Border Area is a hub for TBML, with a $1 billion cross-border cigarette smuggling market used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern for supporting Hezbollah through drug and money laundering schemes. In February 2011, the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) was designated as a primary money-laundering concern for supporting Hezbollah through drug and money laundering schemes involving trade-based money laundering (TBML). An international network moved illegal drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East, laundering hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through LCB accounts and trade-based money laundering with used car dealerships in the United States. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) was involved in money laundering schemes with Hezbollah, moving illegal drugs and laundering millions of dollars monthly through accounts and trade-based schemes. Funds were used to purchase used cars in the US and consumer goods from Asia, which were then sold in other countries. LCB's banking license was eventually revoked by Lebanon's central bank. The Hezbollah-linked drug trafficking network used a BMPE-styled scheme to launder proceeds from Asian-supplied consumer goods in Latin America through LCB's U.S. correspondent accounts. LCB's banking license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. Individuals associated with this network faced financial sanctions and law enforcement investigations in the U.S. Woody Toys, Inc. owners received cash payments from narcotics trafficking and laundered funds in a BMPE scheme. In the late 2000s, owners of the Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking. The funds were laundered through a BMPE scheme by depositing small amounts under $10,000 into the company's bank account to avoid reporting requirements. The cash deposits were used to purchase toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos generated from toy sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. Some employees of Woody Toys had previously worked for Angel Toy Company, which was also involved in a similar toys-for-drugs BMPE scheme. The toy company used cash deposits to buy toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to repay drug traffickers through the BMPE. Some employees had worked for Angel Toy Company, also involved in a similar scheme. Law enforcement investigation benefited from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers and money transfer services. In the early 2000s, a money laundering scheme involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms managed by an Indian national in Dubai. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates worldwide, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other locations. The LCs were in amounts higher than the market value of the exports. The individual in Dubai opened letters of credit through his companies for importers, benefiting affiliated exporters in India. He used connections with banks to transmit LCs and arranged bogus trade documents to inflate export values. Drug trafficking funds were mixed with inflated LCs to move money through trade financing. Exporters in India distributed drug proceeds to affiliates and sold exports at market value. The individual in Dubai used inflated export values in letters of credit to move drug trafficking funds through trade financing to India. Once in India, the drug proceeds were distributed to affiliates and exports were sold at market value. Additionally, the individual facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents and using hawala operators to settle the price difference. U.S. government policy responses to trade-based money laundering include various tools. A network of businesses in India exported banned goods by falsely describing and undervaluing them in trade documents. Hawala operators were used to reconcile the true and fraudulent values. U.S. policy responses to trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and regulatory measures by the Treasury Department. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in 1989 to develop AML/CFT guidelines and currently has 34 member countries. It conducts annual self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines, with the ability to suspend non-compliant members. In 1990, FATF issued 40 recommendations to combat money laundering, with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leading the U.S. delegation to FATF. The FATF issued 40 recommendations in 1990 to combat money laundering, with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leading the U.S. delegation to the FATF. The delegation includes members from various U.S. government departments and plays a crucial role in representing the U.S. at FATF meetings and developing U.S. positions. The U.S. delegation to the FATF, led by staff members, plays a key role in centralizing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It includes members from the Departments of State and Justice, the National Security Council, and federal financial regulators. The delegation develops U.S. positions, represents the United States at FATF meetings, and implements actions domestically to meet U.S. commitments to the FATF. In 2012, FATF members adopted a revised set of the FATF 40 Recommendations, integrating CFT guidelines and adding the proliferation of financing of weapons of mass destruction to areas of surveillance. The new mandate aims to deepen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and support global efforts to raise standards. The FATF has integrated CFT guidelines into its core recommendations and expanded surveillance to include financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and support efforts to raise standards, especially in low capacity countries. The revised recommendations address new threats, strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations, and emphasize transparency in beneficial ownership information. The FATF has updated its recommendations to strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations and improve transparency on beneficial ownership information. Despite the recognition of the risks of trade-based money laundering (TBML), specific recommendations to counter it are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. However, FATF has issued stand-alone reports addressing TBML and best practices. Comprehensive data on the extent of TBML is lacking according to FATF surveys. The FATF has identified the rapid growth of international trade and financing as increasing opportunities for money laundering and terrorist financing. Despite recognizing the risks of trade-based money laundering (TBML), there is a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of this issue. Most jurisdictions do not specifically identify TBML as a separate activity under money laundering and do not provide training to detect TBML activities. The FATF recommends promoting best practices for training to detect TBML. The FATF recommends jurisdictions develop specific training programs for detecting trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities, focusing on financial and trade data analysis. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML, red-flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML), red-flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions. The advisories highlight TBML schemes and provide specific red flags to aid in reporting suspicious activity related to TBML. The advisory on TBML issued by FinCEN aimed to assist financial institutions in reporting suspicious activity related to TBML. It highlighted basic schemes and specific red flags, emphasizing the need for consistent reporting. FinCEN also mentioned delays in reporting suspected TBML activity and issued an updated advisory in May 2014 on increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts. Funnel accounts involve multiple cash deposits below reporting thresholds, with funds withdrawn in a different area shortly after. The advisory on TBML issued by FinCEN highlighted red flags for activity involving funnel accounts in Mexico, used by criminal organizations. FinCEN also relies on Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to identify criminal activity. Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) are a tool authorized in 1988 to impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions in specific areas to help identify criminal activity. GTOs can only last for 180 days and violators may face civil or criminal penalties. Recent GTOs have been used to combat Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML), such as one in April 2015 that targeted Miami-based electronics exporters. This GTO required reporting any cash transactions over $3,000. The GTO imposed stricter cash reporting thresholds for Miami-based electronics exporters, requiring reporting of transactions over $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by drug and crime organizations. FinCEN renewed the GTO for an additional 180 days and issued a similar one for Los Angeles Fashion District businesses. In October 2015, FinCEN renewed the GTO for an additional 180 days with lowered cash reporting to $3,000 targeting businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to combat drug traffickers exploiting fashion industry businesses for money laundering. FinCEN may require financial institutions to take regulatory special measures against money laundering concerns. In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as financial institutions subject to regulatory special measures for their involvement in trade-based money laundering (TBML). These measures can range from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain types of accounts. In April 2013, FinCEN designated Halawi and Rmeiti Exchanges as financial institutions involved in trade-based money laundering (TBML), facilitating transactions for a TBML scheme and providing money laundering services for an international network linked to Hezbollah. The U.S. authorities claim that two exchange houses were involved in money laundering for a narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. The Department of Homeland Security established the Trade Transparency Unit in 2004 to investigate trade anomalies and financial irregularities for TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. Funding from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs supports these investigations. The Trade Transparency Unit (TTU) was established by the Department of Homeland Security in 2004 to investigate trade anomalies and financial irregularities for TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. With funding support from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), TTUs have been set up in various countries to combat these illicit activities. The State Department aims to create an international network of TTUs similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs, with a focus on attacking TBML both domestically and abroad. The number of TBML investigations stemming from TTU activities is on the rise, indicating the effectiveness of these units in combating financial crimes. The National Money Laundering Strategy targets TBML at home and abroad, utilizing ICE-led TTUs to exchange and analyze trade data. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security in Latin America. Over $1 billion has been seized through U.S. and foreign TTU efforts. The 114th Congress has focused on addressing trade-based money laundering (TBML) in relation to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security in Latin America. Witnesses have raised concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, including the role of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs). There is interest in linking U.S. trade policy, free trade agreements, and mutual commitments to combat TBML and terrorist financing. The 114th Congress has focused on addressing trade-based money laundering (TBML) in relation to terrorist groups like Hezbollah. In December 2015, the Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to apply additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. Some policymakers remain concerned about the links between terrorism and TBML, pointing to examples implicating Hezbollah in TBML schemes. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 directed additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. OFAC issued a final rule for its implementation in April 2016. President Obama committed to imposing sanctions to counter Hezbollah's activities. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 imposed financial restrictions on Hezbollah. President Obama pledged to sanction Hezbollah's activities. The Treasury Department plans to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other tools to address trade-based money laundering. Congress may continue to monitor the implementation of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 and other financial tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML) while preserving the strength and health of the Lebanese financial system. Hearings in the 114th Congress have discussed TBML, including a specific hearing on the topic titled \"Trading with the Enemy: Trade-Based Money Laundering is the Growth Industry in Terror Finance.\" The House committees have held hearings on terrorist financing trends, examining terror funding streams from South America, and coordinating government efforts to stop terror finance. These efforts aim to address trade-based money laundering (TBML) and strengthen the Lebanese financial system. The House committees have conducted hearings on terrorist financing trends, focusing on stopping terror finance, preventing cultural genocide by ISIS, and examining the state of the international financial system. The House committees have conducted hearings on terrorist financing trends, focusing on preventing cultural genocide by ISIS and examining the state of the international financial system. The House committees have conducted hearings on terrorist financing trends, including reviewing the Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2017 and the Future Years Defense Program, investigating terrorism financing in the developing world, and addressing trade-based money laundering in terror finance. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also discussed terrorist financing through kidnapping, antiquities trafficking, and private donations. Trade-Based Money Laundering is a growing issue in terror finance, with various committees such as the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee discussing the impact of terrorist financing through activities like kidnapping and antiquities trafficking. The curr_chunk discusses various committee hearings related to public safety, border security, and terrorism financing. Various committee hearings related to public safety, border security, and terrorism financing were conducted by the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, House Financial Services Committee, House Judiciary Committee, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and House Foreign Affairs Committee. Various committee hearings related to public safety, border security, and terrorism financing were conducted by the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, House Financial Services Committee, House Judiciary Committee, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and House Foreign Affairs Committee. The hearings included topics such as the impact of transnational crime on border security, Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere, and the state of the international financial system."
