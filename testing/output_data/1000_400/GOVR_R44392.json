To claim the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC), taxpayers must be in one of two eligibility groups: recipients of certain benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program and individuals aged 55-64 receiving payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). TAA helps workers who lose their jobs due to international trade, and if certified, they are eligible for the HCTC based on receipt of certain TAA benefits. Workers who lose their jobs due to international trade can petition the U.S. Department of Labor to establish eligibility for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits.

Workers who lose their jobs due to international trade can receive Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) after exhausting unemployment insurance (UI). They can also qualify for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) while collecting TRA or UI. Additionally, workers aged 50 and older may be eligible for Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) which provides a wage supplement for up to two years. Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is a similar wage-insurance program. Eligibility for the HCTC is limited to individuals receiving TAA benefits.

State workforce agencies (SWAs) administer unemployment and TAA benefits, while the PBGC and IRS identify potential HCTC beneficiaries and provide relevant information for eligibility. SWAs mail HCTC information packets to eligible TAA beneficiaries, including an eligibility certificate. The IRS sends program kits to individuals identified by SWAs and PBGC.
