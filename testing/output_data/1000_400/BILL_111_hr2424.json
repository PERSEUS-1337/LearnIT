    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009\" is referred to as the short title. It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress found that in August 2007, liquidity dried up in credit and securities markets, initially affecting financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed securities. This lack of credit access spread globally, leading to the Federal Reserve establishing a target range of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008. The Federal Reserve responded to the financial crisis by setting a target range of 0 to 0.25 percent for the Federal funds rate in December 2008, acknowledging the severity of the crisis and using its authority to address unusual circumstances multiple times. The Federal Reserve has responded to \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" by exercising its authority multiple times since the financial crisis began. This includes providing assistance to nonmember institutions and purchasing debt obligations. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided assistance to nonmember institutions and purchased debt obligations from government-sponsored enterprises for the first time since 1981. Additionally, joint programs were established with the Department of the Treasury to aid financial markets, including guaranteeing assets of Citigroup and Bank of America. Chairman Ben Bernanke emphasized transparency in his testimony on February 10, 2009.
