    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. Applicants must demonstrate no violation of NAAQS or exceedances of air pollution limits under PSD regulations. The New Source Review (NSR) process requires applicants to demonstrate compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations for proposed sources or modifications. NSR is triggered for sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Specific requirements depend on whether the source is subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. The New Source Review (NSR) process applies to sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Requirements vary based on whether the source is subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. PSD sources must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) while non-attainment sources must install Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain offsets. Despite NSR's broad coverage, few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants. The New Source Review (NSR) process applies to sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. If covered by non-attainment provisions, the source is required to install Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain applicable offsets for that particular area. Despite the breadth of coverage suggested by NSR, few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants over the program's history. Current U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity has remained steady at about 300,000 megawatts (MW) for the last ten years, with minimal additions to capacity. The current U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity has remained steady for the last ten years, with minimal additions to capacity. Emissions trends show a constant level of NOx emissions, while SO2 emissions saw a significant drop in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under the 1990 CAA Amendments. EPA required 111 power plants to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels specified in the program. The acid rain control program under the 1990 CAA Amendments led to a drop in emissions in 1995. 111 power plants were required to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels, resulting in a reduction of 10 million tons of SO2 emissions in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995. Additionally, NOx emissions were reduced by 0.4 million tons in 1996. However, some of the reductions achieved were offset by increases in emissions from other plants. The acid rain control program in 1990 led to reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions by 1995 and 1996, respectively. However, some of the reductions achieved were offset by increases in emissions from other plants, indicating a slippage in overall emissions reduction. Despite the overall flat trends in coal-fired capacity and air emissions, there are some sources of increasing emissions. Existing coal-fired facilities continue to operate and increase electricity generation and coal consumption. Despite aging, the efficiency of coal-fired units has not decreased, suggesting a change in plant maintenance economics. The efficiency of aging coal-fired plants has not decreased, leading utilities to spend more on maintenance. The question raised by EPA lawsuits is whether this maintenance constitutes a \"major modification\" under the CAA, requiring pollution control equipment. The EPA is questioning whether maintenance on aging coal-fired plants constitutes a \"major modification\" under the CAA, which would require pollution control equipment. Utilities are avoiding the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants due to the 1970 Clean Air Act. There is regulatory uncertainty surrounding maintenance on aging coal-fired plants under the Clean Air Act, leading utilities to avoid using the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants. The 1970 Clean Air Act requires power plants built before 1971 to restrict emissions, but modifications could result in losing exemptions. Regulatory activities include the Ozone Transport Rule and Section 126. Plants can lose their exemption if they are \"modified\" or \"reconstructed\" in a major way, leading to increased emission of proscribed pollutants. There is considerable regulatory activity regarding electricity generation and air quality, including the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, revised Ozone NAAQS, NSPS for NOx for electric utilities, initiatives by the Ozone Transport Commission, and legislative initiatives. NSR enforcement is seen as a primary permitting and enforcement tool, with Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits aiming to enforce existing laws and regulations. NSR enforcement is a primary permitting and enforcement tool used by the Department of Justice/EPA to enforce existing laws and regulations for stationary sources. It is different from regulatory development activities and allows EPA to seek court-imposed remedial actions on affected utilities, including monetary penalties and installation of the most recent BACT technology. The EPA's NSR enforcement action on coal-fired utilities began in late 1996. It allows the court to impose penalties and require the installation of advanced pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization units for SO2 reduction and selective catalytic reduction units for NOx reduction, resulting in emissions reductions of 70-90%. The EPA's NSR enforcement action on coal-fired utilities involves imposing penalties and requiring the installation of advanced pollution control technology like flue-gas desulfurization units and selective catalytic reduction units to reduce emissions by 70-90%. This could lead to substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, equivalent to taking 26 million cars off the road and reducing acid rain by 15%. Browner stated that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from coal-fired plants could lead to an 85-95% reduction in pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15%. The focus on NSR reflects a belief that continuing operation of aging coal-fired plants is a future trend under electric utility restructuring, which is cost-effective compared to building new capacity. Requiring Best Available Control Technology (BACT) through NSR could mitigate environmental effects of renovating existing coal-fired capacity in a competitive market. The trend towards renovating existing coal-fired capacity is cost-effective compared to building new capacity in a competitive generating market. The EPA is taking legal action against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades, with a focus on enforcing NSR for existing coal-fired facilities. This trend has been increasing in the industry for almost two decades, with potential emissions impacts recognized early on but not enforced until October 1988. The EPA's enforcement of NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities has been a challenge due to budget constraints and the difficulty in defining a major modification. The term \"modification\" was first used in the 1970 CAA Amendments, with subsequent regulations focusing on changes that increase air pollutant emissions. The CAA first defined \"modification\" in the 1970 Amendments as any physical or operational change increasing air pollutant emissions. EPA regulations later specified that any increase in maximum hourly emission rate or replacement of components exceeding 50% of fixed capital costs triggered NSPS requirements. The shift to NSR in 1977 focused on compliance with NAAQS and PSD, requiring a different approach to defining modification. EPA regulations defined modifications in 1970 as any increase in emissions, with NSPS triggered by component replacements exceeding 50% of fixed capital costs. The shift to NSR in 1977 focused on NAAQS and PSD compliance, with thresholds set for significant emission increases. Facilities exceeding 40 tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are subject to NSR, but enforcing these thresholds has proven challenging. EPA's NSPS thresholds do not constrain utilities' life extension efforts, which mainly aim to improve generating unit availability and reliability. Enforcing NSR thresholds for facilities exceeding 40 tons has been challenging. EPA's NSPS program does not limit utilities' life extension efforts, which focus on improving generating unit availability and reliability. Life extension activities may increase emissions, triggering NSR review based on tonnage increase in pollutant output. The measurement of these changes and establishing baselines became contentious in the late 1980s when EPA started enforcing NSR against facilities undergoing modifications. In the late 1980s, EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension projects, which focus on improving availability and reliability of generating units. These activities may increase emissions, triggering NSR review based on tonnage increase in pollutant output. EPA modified the emissions trigger for electric utilities in 1992 to compare a facility's actual emissions before modification with its projected actual emissions. After EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension projects in the late 1980s, the emissions trigger for electric utilities was modified in 1992. The current NSR regulations compare a facility's actual emissions before a modification with its projected actual emissions after the modification. This involves assessing the facility's average emission rate over a 2-year period before the proposed change and projecting future emissions based on historical and other data. Utilities also address EPA's concerns regarding their life extension activities. Maintenance, repair, and other activities are excluded from being considered modifications under NSR. The current NSR regulations for utility plants involve comparing a facility's actual emissions before a modification with its projected actual emissions after the change. EPA excludes routine maintenance, repair, and replacement from being considered modifications. Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to align with routine maintenance schedules, using terms like capital improvement and performance improvement instead of \"life extension.\" The term \"life extension\" in professional literature has been replaced with terms like capital improvement, performance improvement, and unit integrity. By integrating life extension efforts into maintenance schedules, the distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" is blurred. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce Clean Air Act requirements for new construction of coal-fired capacity by utilities. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce Clean Air Act requirements for new construction of coal-fired capacity by utilities, blurring the distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance.\" The resolution is not expected soon, as EPA identifies instances triggering new source reviews for coal-fired power plants. The EPA issued a \"Compliance Order\" regarding modifications made by the Tennessee Valley Authority to its coal-fired power plants that should have triggered new source reviews. The Justice Department/EPA cited facilities for violating NSR requirements and seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for past NSR violations. Additional complaints may be issued as investigations proceed. The EPA issued a \"Compliance Order\" against investor-owned facilities for violating NSR requirements, seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. Complaints may be issued as investigations continue. The order requires compliance with CAA requirements, installation of BACT for past NSR violations, permit applications, and audits for NSR compliance. TVA is asked to develop a schedule for meeting requirements, audit coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retire SO2 allowances for reductions. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action has been focused. The EPA issued a \"Compliance Order\" against investor-owned facilities for violating NSR requirements, seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. The order requires compliance with CAA requirements, installation of BACT for past NSR violations, permit applications, and audits for NSR compliance. TVA is asked to audit coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance and retire SO2 allowances for reductions. Industry's response to EPA's enforcement action focuses on an exemption under NSR for \"routine maintenance.\" Industry argues that EPA has not objected to utilities engaging in activities now cited as triggering NSR violations over the past 20 years. They claim these activities are necessary for plant operation and should not be considered major modifications. The industry asserts that emissions must not exceed the cap, but unused allowances will still be emitted. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, resulting in a decrease of 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. This would be a significant improvement compared to previous emissions reductions. The EPA Administrator stated that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, resulting in a decrease of 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. This would significantly surpass previous emissions reductions. The Clean Air Act (CAA) is a complex legislation with various emission reduction programs. The CAA's New Source Review (NSR) action could lead to substantial emission reductions, but it interacts with other reduction requirements like the SO2 reduction program under title IV. This program limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, enforced through tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements. The Clean Air Act's SO2 reduction program limits total emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, enforced through tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements. Emissions allowances are allocated to existing facilities based on historical data, allowing for trading or banking for future use or sale. The program has achieved 100% compliance. The EPA issues allowances for facilities to emit SO2, allocated based on emission rate/fuel consumption formulas. Allowances can be used at the allocated plant, traded, or banked. The program, part of the 1990 CAA Amendments, focuses on reducing aggregate SO2 emissions. It does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program, which focuses on modifications at existing facilities and installation of BACT. Compliance with the cap is the key criterion for the Title IV program. The Title IV program focuses on reducing aggregate SO2 emissions by allowing utilities flexibility in compliance strategies. Existing facilities may install BACT under the NSR program, but the allocations under Title IV are less stringent and can be met with low-sulfur coal, leading to excess allowances for sale or banking. The Title IV program allows utilities to reduce SO2 emissions by 70%-90% depending on the coal burned. However, existing coal-fired facilities can meet allocations with low-sulfur coal, leading to excess allowances for sale. NSR enforcement could be nullified by Title IV if plants sell their SO2 reductions. There is no provision in Title IV for adjusting allowances based on NSR enforcement. The Title IV program allows utilities to reduce SO2 emissions by 70%-90% depending on the coal burned. However, there is no provision in Title IV for adjusting allowances based on NSR enforcement. The interaction of NSR and the NOx NSPS is complex, with the NOx NSPS historically not reflecting cutting-edge technology until 1998. The NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities was set in 1979 and could be met with fairly simple combustion. The NOx NSPS historically did not reflect cutting-edge technology until 1998. The standard set in 1979 could be met with simple combustion modifications or low-NOx burners, without requiring pollution control devices like SCR. In 1998, a new NOx NSPS of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu was established for coal-fired facilities, but it was challenged in court in 1999. In 1998, EPA established a new NOx NSPS of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu for coal-fired facilities, which was later challenged in court. The D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the new standard for modified utility boilers in 1999, leaving the NSPS for modified sources at the 1979 standard until EPA proposes a revised NSPS. The uncertainty surrounding the floor for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources could impact the expected reductions in emissions. The uncertainty surrounding the floor for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources is unclear. The interaction of NSR and title IV further complicates the situation, as the NOx reduction program under title IV differs from the SO2 program. The title IV NOx program is based on emission rates, with existing facilities required to meet set rates regardless of modifications. This results in a more stringent emission rate compared to the 1979 NOx NSPS. The emission rate for the title IV program is set for existing facilities to be achieved in 1995 or 2000, regardless of modifications. Some existing coal-fired facilities have emission controls more stringent than the existing NSPS. It is difficult to project NOx reduction achieved by EPA's NSR action. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions from sources evading statutory rules. The effectiveness of this action is questioned, as it may lead to costly litigation instead of actual emission reductions. NSR was implemented under the Clean Air Act to control emissions, but there are concerns about more efficient methods for pollution control. The Clean Air Act's NSR provisions aim to control emissions from existing sources, but there are doubts about its effectiveness compared to other methods like the title IV program, which has shown significant reductions in emissions. EPA's enforcement of NSR requirements may result in costly litigation without substantial emission reductions. The title IV program has successfully reduced SO2 emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities, outperforming the NSR program. Compliance with the cap and trade system has been high, while NSR enforcement has faced challenges and uncertainties. One alternative suggested is to lower the cap on SO2 emissions under title IV to further reduce emissions from power plants. To further reduce SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants, one alternative is to lower the cap on emissions under title IV's cap and trade program. This would achieve similar emission reductions as the 1978 NSPS for existing powerplants, with some flexibility for utilities. While utilities may receive credit for shutdowns not allowed under NSR enforcement, the administrative and cost advantages of the allowance system could be worth considering. This approach would require new legislation but could offer benefits in emission reduction and flexibility. A new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx emissions could provide advantages over the NSR enforcement debate and other EPA initiatives. EPA is encouraging states to consider a regional cap and trade program to address Ozone Transport Rule compliance and Section 126 petitions. This program is also part of the proposed Federal Implementation Plan for states with inadequate SIPs. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade program for NOx emissions as part of compliance with Ozone Transport Rule and Section 126 petitions. Implementing such a program would require cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Alternatively, focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives is being considered by EPA. The EPA is considering alternatives to the NSR process, such as focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. These initiatives include the OTR and Section 126 petitions, as well as regulations on fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze. Implementing these regulations will require emissions reductions, although the schedules are long. Another alternative is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. The EPA is considering alternatives to the NSR process, focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. Initiatives include OTR and Section 126 petitions, regulations on fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze. Implementing these regulations will require emissions reductions, with long schedules. Another alternative is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. EPA has argued for authority to regulate CO2, which is controversial. The EPA is exploring alternatives to the NSR process to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. This includes regulations on fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze. One option is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, with potential CO2 reductions coming from voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Reforming NSR could involve defining \"modification\" based on plant age rather than physical changes, simplifying the trigger for NSR but requiring legislative action. One potential reform to the NSR process involves defining \"modification\" based on plant age, simplifying the trigger for NSR but requiring legislative action. Another proposed reform includes the \"Clean Unit Exclusion,\" which would exempt units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology from NSR applicability rules. The \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" proposed by the EPA would exempt units with advanced pollution control technology from NSR rules. This exclusion defines a \"clean unit\" as one that has installed BACT or LAER within the last 10 years. However, the effectiveness of this proposal is debatable due to the need for legislative action or finalization of regulations. EPA is considering cap and trade programs as an alternative approach. EPA is considering cap and trade programs as an alternative to NSR rules, which are seen as duplicative and counterproductive. The debate on NSR often focuses on \"grandfathered\" power plants with exemptions allowing them to emit more pollution than newer plants. EPA believes replacing NSR with a cap would provide the same environmental protection at a lower cost and greater benefit. The debate on NSR has centered on \"grandfathered\" power plants, which are older coal-burning plants exempt from emitting more pollution than newer plants under the Clean Air Act. Industry lobbyists argued for this exemption, claiming the older plants would retire soon, but many are still operating without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered power plant\" is commonly used but not well understood in discussions on emissions from existing plants. Many older power plants built in the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s are still operating without environmental controls, known as \"grandfathered power plants.\" This term is used in debates on emissions and refers to whether a plant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, which sets regulations for new sources. These regulations, called New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), require new sources to install the best emission reduction system. The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) regulations apply to new sources, including power plants, requiring them to install proven emission reduction systems. \"Grandfathered\" plants, built before NSPS regulations, are not subject to them and must meet emission rate limits set by State Implementation Plans (SIP). The NSPS regulations for power plants were first established in 1971, revised in 1979, and the NOx regulations were updated in 1998. NSPS regulations for power plants were first promulgated in 1971 and revised in 1979. The NOx NSPS regulations for power plants were revised again in 1998. \"Grandfathered\" sources must meet emission rate limits established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP) instead of NSPS requirements. Some pollutants like CO2 and Hg are not covered by NSPS for power plants. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years for increased stringency as technology improves. The NSPS for power plants are reviewed every eight years for increased stringency as technology improves. \"Grandfathered\" sources are ambiguous as there is no set baseline, making it unclear which power plants are exempt. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired power plants are required to meet stringent standards for NOx and SO2 emissions, making the term \"grandfathered\" essentially meaningless in this context. Age of the plant is not a relevant consideration, fuel source is. \"Grandfathered\" coal-fired power plants in 2000 must meet stringent SO2 standards, making the term \"grandfathered\" meaningless. Age of the plant is not relevant for NOx emissions, fuel source is. For SO2 emissions, the title IV emissions cap is the key consideration, not NSPS compliance. New power plants must comply with NSPS for SO2, but it is somewhat irrelevant due to the emissions cap. The age of the plant is not relevant for NOx emissions, only the fuel source matters. The emissions cap is the key consideration for SO2 emissions, not NSPS compliance. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is the most logical approach to reducing emissions from electric generating facilities. EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional action. The EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional action. The DOJ/EPA actions on NSR may also lead to public debate and congressional oversight. Many issues are being raised regarding interpretations of CAA provisions and the need for new legislation to update the Clean Air Act's approach to regulating the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
