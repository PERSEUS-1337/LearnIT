    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the authority to expand eligibility for all children under 19. States have the authority to expand eligibility for all children under 19 up to 200% of the federal poverty level. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children, using the regular Medicaid matching rate for those with family income exceeding 300% of poverty. States can expand eligibility for children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. For children with family income exceeding 300% of poverty, states may exclude a block of income not determined by type of expense or income. States can provide assistance through Medicaid or a separate CHIP program, with federal CHIP funds covering program costs. Title XXI rules apply when states provide coverage to low-income children through separate CHIP programs, with federal funds covering program costs. States with approved CHIP plans receive federal allotments based on a distribution formula, but there is no individual entitlement to benefits under Title XXI. Low-income children covered under a CHIP-financed Medicaid expansion are entitled to benefits as per Medicaid law. States can cover low-income children by expanding Medicaid programs through new eligibility groups or by adjusting existing financial rules. Many states opt to cover these children under existing Medicaid pathways rather than creating new coverage groups, reducing administrative burden. States can cover targeted low-income children under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways or by creating separate CHIP programs, reducing administrative burden. States have flexibility in determining eligibility factors such as geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, and access to other health insurance. Title XXI allows states to use factors like geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility to determine eligibility. States could cover adult pregnant women through waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or a family coverage option. States have various options to extend coverage to pregnant women, including waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, and family coverage options. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds, with some using waivers and others extending coverage through state plan amendments. Most states also extended coverage to unborn children of adult pregnant women, including undocumented aliens. In FY2008, 12 states provided pregnancy-related services to unborn children under CHIP SPAs, with most extending coverage to undocumented aliens. CHIPRA introduced a new option for states to cover pregnant women under CHIP through state plan amendments, subject to certain conditions. California had the highest number of unborn children enrolled in CHIP at 176,822 out of 364,161. States have the option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to meet. Coverage includes pregnancy through the postpartum period, with benefits including all services. Presumptive eligibility allows temporary enrollment for up to two months. Pregnant women can be temporarily enrolled in CHIP for up to two months until eligibility is determined. Benefits include prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants covered up to age one. States may also offer postpartum services to pregnant women. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were previously ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits. CHIPRA clarified that states can offer postpartum services to pregnant women and cover legal immigrants after a five-year bar, with sponsor's income and resources taken into account for eligibility. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for immigrants' eligibility for means-tested programs. CHIPRA allows states to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the US. The CHIP state plan option is available for states that elect to provide assistance for pregnant women. The CHIP state plan option allows states to provide coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the US. States electing this option must ensure that the cost of care is not counted against the sponsor. Eligibility redetermination requires individuals to provide further documentation if their initial legal residence proof expires. Under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to modify CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically eligible. States can cover adults with CHIP funds through waivers, which are subject to renewal every three years. Individuals must provide additional documentation if their initial proof of legal residence expires. As of January 7, 2009, some states have used waivers to extend CHIP coverage to childless adults and parents of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. Waivers for adult coverage are initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. However, waiver renewals for states with adult coverage waivers have not been approved since 2007, leading to some states transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds for childless adults, and 7 states have such authority for parent populations. As of January 7, 2009, some states have used waivers to extend CHIP coverage to childless adults and parents of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of calendar year 2009. States with existing childless adult waivers that were in effect during FY2009 are permitted to apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage for these individuals. CHIPRA requires budget neutrality standards for succeeding fiscal years to be tied to waiver spending in the preceding fiscal year. Coverage of parents under CHIP parent coverage waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment starting in FY2012. States meeting coverage benchmarks in FY2013 will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. Waiver spending under the set-aside for parents is prohibited by CHIPRA. CHIPRA includes provisions to facilitate access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, authorizing $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants. Ten percent is allocated to a national enrollment campaign, 10% for outreach to Native American children, and the remaining 80% distributed among states. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Ten percent allocated to a national enrollment campaign, 10% for outreach to Native American children, and the remaining 80% distributed among states, local governments, and community-based organizations for outreach campaigns focusing on rural areas and underserved populations. Grant funds target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. Additionally, CHIPRA requires state plans to describe procedures for reducing administrative barriers to enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013, targeting proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. The state plan must describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers to enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, CHIPRA allows states to rely on \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility requirements for children under age 19. CHIPRA allows states to use programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, CHIP, and Food Stamps to assess a child's eligibility for medical assistance. States can implement automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility determination with family consent. States can also consider an applicant's reported income from state tax records. CHIPRA requires states to inform families about potential lower premiums or better coverage under Medicaid. The provision under CHIPRA allows states to use an applicant's reported income from state tax records for eligibility assessment. It eliminates the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP application forms and provides an alternative method for verifying citizenship using Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA. Before the DRA, states could accept self-declaration of citizenship for Medicaid, but CHIPRA now requires proof of citizenship and identity. States can use Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA for verification. CHIPRA also mandates citizenship documentation for CHIP. Some states have CHIP coverage above 250%, with New Jersey having the highest income eligibility limit at 350% of the FPL. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data by population group. New Jersey has the highest income eligibility limit at 350% of the FPL. 22 states have upper income limits at 200% FPL, while 6 states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL. CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children in FY2008, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid for targeted low-income children. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid for targeted low-income children. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, with 335,000 adults enrolled in FY2008, including parents, childless adults, and pregnant women. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from previous years due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment for adults decreased due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States may cover low-income children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. States using Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to enroll low-income children in Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs with full Medicaid benefits or in separate CHIP programs with similar benefits. States have the option to provide benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit plans for children under age 21. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to offer benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit plans for children under age 21 through separate CHIP programs. States must provide benefits through the EPSDT Program, including well-child care, immunizations, and necessary medical care. States can choose from three benefit options for their separate CHIP programs. States can offer benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit plans for children under age 21 through separate CHIP programs. The three benefit options include a benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit packages can be based on specific health plans such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee coverage, or the largest HMO in the state. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for children under age 21 can be offered by states through separate CHIP programs. It must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, lab and x-ray services, and well-child care with immunizations. The coverage should have the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark benefit packages. The basic benefits category for children under age 21 in CHIP programs includes inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' surgical and medical services, lab and x-ray services, and well-baby and well-child care with immunizations. Benchmark-equivalent coverage must also include at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, vision services, and hearing services. Abortions are only covered in specific circumstances. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs. CHIP programs cover a range of services for children under 21, including hospital services, physician care, and immunizations. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage. All states, DC, and territories have CHIP programs with various approaches to implementation. The CHIPRA law made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under state CHIP plans, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. EPSDT services are also included in state CHIP plans. State CHIP plans must adhere to mental health parity requirements, with no separate cost-sharing or treatment limitations for mental health or substance abuse benefits. Dental services are now a required benefit, including preventive care, restoration, and emergency treatment. States can offer dental services through benchmark packages. The new law requires dental services for CHIP Medicaid expansion children, with options for states to provide services through benchmark dental benefit packages. Provisions include dental education for parents, services at federally qualified health centers, and reporting requirements on children receiving dental care. Information on providers and services will be available to the public. The new law mandates dental services for CHIP Medicaid expansion children, with options for states to offer services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on children receiving dental care, including the availability of providers and covered services. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers and utilizing mid-level providers. CHIPRA allowed CHIP funds to be used for premium assistance programs and provided a state option for separate CHIP programs. CHIPRA provided a state option for separate CHIP programs to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in employer coverage. States can provide dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP, with the upper income level set by the state. States can offer dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP for children, with the upper income level determined by the state. Dental-only supplemental coverage can only be provided if certain conditions are met, and states cannot offer more favorable dental coverage for children with supplemental coverage than for CHIP children. States can provide dental coverage under CHIP for children, with eligibility limitations and benefits provided to all children who meet the standards. States cannot offer better dental coverage for children with supplemental coverage than for CHIP children. States have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. States can use CHIP funds to assist with employer-based health insurance premiums if the plan is cost-effective and does not replace existing coverage. Medicaid also allows for premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective for the state. Enrollees must meet certain criteria, such as not having group coverage for a specified period of time. States may implement a premium assistance program under Medicaid, including a Medicaid expansion CHIP program, if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective. Enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if it is cheaper than the state providing Medicaid-covered services directly. States must offer \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for services not included in private plans to meet the comprehensiveness test. Many employer plans and states find it challenging to meet all requirements, leading to the use of waivers for CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs. States may implement premium assistance programs under Medicaid, including a Medicaid expansion CHIP program, by offering \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for services not included in private plans. To overcome challenges in meeting requirements, most states operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs under waivers. CHIPRA introduced a state plan option for providing premium assistance and mandated states to offer outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for eligible families. Premium assistance can be extended to Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, meeting specific criteria. Under CHIPRA, states have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The premium assistance subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children versus only covering the employee. Individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage can choose to enroll in regular CHIP instead of the premium assistance program. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children compared to just covering the employee. Individuals can choose regular CHIP over the premium assistance program. If employer plans don't meet CHIP benefit requirements, a wrap-around is needed. No cost-effectiveness test is required for child coverage using premium assistance. A separate test applies for family coverage, where the subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it's cheaper than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children compared to just covering the employee. A separate test applies for family coverage, where the subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it's cheaper than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone. States and participating employers are required to do outreach for premium assistance. Premium assistance provisions under Medicaid, not CHIP, apply to children enrolled in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. The CHIPRA law allows states to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. It also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, and copayments. States can request information from health plan administrators to evaluate the need for wraparound coverage. The CHIPRA law allows states to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by beneficiaries of a health insurance plan, including premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can request information from health plan administrators to evaluate the need for wraparound coverage, and DRA provided states with new options for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for targeted low-income children under Medicaid and CHIP. The DRA provided states with new options for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for targeted low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. Premiums and cost-sharing vary based on family income levels, with no premiums allowed for children in families with income under 100% FPL, and service-related cost-sharing limited to nominal amounts. For children in families with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums are allowed, but cost-sharing can be up to 10% of the item/service cost. Premiums are allowed for children in families with income above 150% FPL, with cost-sharing up to 20% of the item/service cost. For individuals with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums are imposed, but cost-sharing can be up to 10% of the service cost. For those above 150% FPL, premiums are allowed with cost-sharing up to 20%. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt. Medicaid cost-sharing amounts will be indexed to medical care inflation. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. States can require premium payments for continuing Medicaid eligibility. Providers may deny care for non-payment. The Medicaid cost-sharing amounts will be indexed to medical care inflation. States can condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payments. Providers may deny care for non-payment. CHIP programs may impose premiums based on family income. Service-related cost-sharing is limited for families with incomes under 150% FPL. For families with incomes under 150% FPL enrolled in separate state programs, premiums are capped as per federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing is limited for lower-income families and slightly higher for those with income between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing up to 5% of family income, with equal cost-sharing for all children. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. Cost-sharing for higher-income children in CHIP is subject to a 5% out-of-pocket limit of family income. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services, including newborn visits, physical exams, immunizations, and dental services, are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to expand and improve data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, including developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. States were required to report on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium data in their annual CHIP reports. The CHIPRA 2009 legislation aimed to enhance data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid by introducing standardized reporting formats and quality measures for pediatric care. States were mandated to report on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium data in their annual CHIP reports. Additionally, a federal commission called MACPAC was established to review policies impacting children's access to benefits and make recommendations for improving care quality and access. Regular reports to Congress detailing these findings and recommendations are required. The CHIPRA 2009 legislation established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review policies affecting children's access to benefits under both programs. MACPAC will provide regular reports to Congress with recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children. Additionally, the Secretary of HHS will conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess outreach and enrollment strategies and the effects of these programs. The federal evaluation of CHIP will assess outreach and enrollment strategies, cost-sharing effects on utilization, and factors related to disenrollment and retention of children. Federal financing for CHIP includes total appropriations, reallocation of funds, and factors affecting federal financing. BBA 97 allocated approximately $40 billion for CHIP from FY1998 to FY2007. The BBA 97 allocated around $40 billion for CHIP from FY1998 to FY2007, with varying annual appropriations. Funding levels dropped in FY2002-FY2004 due to budget constraints, but increased in subsequent years. The 110th Congress passed two bills to \"reauthorize\" CHIP. The funding for CHIP increased to $4.1 billion for FY2005 and FY2006, and then to $5.0 billion in FY2007. The 110th Congress passed two bills to reauthorize CHIP, but both were vetoed by President George W. Bush. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds for CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009, with additional funds appropriated due to projected shortfalls. CHIPRA allocated $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013, with specific amounts for each fiscal year. The distribution of federal CHIP funds among states is determined by a formula set in law. The CHIPRA allocated increasing amounts of federal funds to states for CHIP from FY2009 to FY2013. The distribution among states is determined by a formula set in law, based on the number of low-income and uninsured children in each state. The CHIPRA allocated federal funds to states for CHIP based on the number of low-income and uninsured children. CHIP allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with payments typically taken out early. The CHIPRA allocated federal funds to states for CHIP based on the number of low-income and uninsured children. CHIP allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with payments typically taken out early. For each state and territory, the account for a given fiscal year is made available at the beginning of that year and remains available for a certain period of time. FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are the largest of three state-specific amounts, determined by a growth factor and state projections of federal CHIP spending. The state's FY2008 federal CHIP spending, FY2008 federal CHIP allotment, and state's projections of federal CHIP spending for FY2009 will determine the state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment. If the national appropriation is insufficient, allotments will be reduced proportionally. For FY2010, the allotment will be calculated based on four amounts, including FY2009 CHIP allotment and spending from previous years. For FY2010 and FY2011-FY2013, state (or territory) allotments are calculated based on various factors including previous CHIP allotments, unspent funds, Contingency Fund payments, and growth factors. Unspent allotments are available at the end of the period. The allotment for a state (or territory) for FY2012 is calculated by multiplying the state's growth factor by the prior year's federal CHIP spending. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period, with rules varying by fiscal year. BBA 97 stipulated that states had to exhaust their allotment within three years to be eligible for unspent funds. In FY2006, additional funds were appropriated to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states. In FY2006, Congress appropriated $283 million to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states, with Illinois and Massachusetts experiencing higher CHIP spending than anticipated. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent funds from FY2004 was redistributed to states based on funding shortfalls for that year. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 (H.R. 6164, P.L. 109-482) required funds to be redistributed to states based on funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007, aiming to delay shortfalls until the end of March 2007. The Act also called for an initial redistribution of up to half of unspent FY2005 funds by March 31, 2007, capped at $20 million per state. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 aimed to delay funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 by redistributing unspent FY2005 funds to states. This redistribution was capped at $20 million per state and was projected to provide an additional $138 million for shortfall states, delaying any state facing a shortfall of federal CHIP funds until May 2007. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 provided $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for FY2007. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 funds and appropriated up to $1.6 billion for states' remaining shortfalls, with actual funding totaling just under $1 billion. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 funds and appropriated up to $1.6 billion for states' remaining shortfalls, with actual funding totaling just under $1 billion. For FY2009, MMSEA also redistributed unspent FY2006 funds and appropriated up to $275 million for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. The increased FY2009 allotments provided by CHIPRA should prevent any federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. MMSEA appropriated up to $275 million for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. CHIPRA increased FY2009 allotments to prevent federal CHIP funding shortfalls. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created to prevent states from experiencing shortfalls of federal CHIP funds. Payments from the Contingency Fund cannot exceed 20% of the target enrollment level. The CHIPRA measure created a Contingency Fund to prevent states from federal CHIP funding shortfalls. Payments from the fund cannot exceed 20% of the target enrollment level. CHIP is a federal-state matching program with an enhanced FMAP for CHIP, reducing a state's share of expenditures by 30%. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP reduces a state's share of expenditures by 30% compared to the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP ranges from 65% to 83.09% for CHIP, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. All CHIP assistance for low-income children is eligible for the enhanced FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%. Medicaid and CHIP assistance for low-income children are eligible for the enhanced FMAP, with ceilings of 83% and 85% respectively. There is a limit on federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses, with a 10% cap on state non-benefit expenses. Federal funds for CHIP benefit and non-benefit expenditures combined cannot exceed 10% for non-benefit costs, including administrative expenses. Under CHIP, states can use up to 10% of federal funds for non-benefit costs, including administrative expenses. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach activities. Funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment amounts."
