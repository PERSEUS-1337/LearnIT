    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and disrupted domestic grain prices. The exports continue to increase without limits, further harming U.S. farmers each year. Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement are causing increasing financial losses to American farmers. The Congress approved the agreement with conditions related to consultations on the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board affecting goods exported to the United States. The United States has not made progress on consultations regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for agricultural goods exported to the United States. Additionally, there has been a failure to pursue the exclusion of Canadian agricultural goods from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act for consumption in the United States. The United States has not made progress on consultations regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for agricultural goods exported to the United States. This failure led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. Negotiations with Canada are required to determine the price of agricultural goods sold by the Canadian Wheat Board to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. If negotiations fail to establish pricing methods or data procedures within 120 days, Canada will be in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, leading to the suspension of Canadian grain imports until successful negotiations are certified by the President. SEC. 102 of the Act requires the President to negotiate with Canada to exclude Canadian agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates will be suspended until successful negotiations are certified. The President must negotiate with Canada to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain with transportation subsidies will be suspended. If negotiations fail to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must assist petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program can be used to promote grain exports. Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the United States by allowing exporters to compete effectively with Canadian grain producers, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The amendment to Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 aims to counteract transportation subsidies provided by the Government of Canada for grain sales to Mexico and the Canadian Wheat Board selling wheat in foreign markets below acquisition cost. These requirements will apply until an agreement is reached with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates. The amendment aims to counteract transportation subsidies for grain sales and the Canadian Wheat Board selling wheat below acquisition cost until an agreement is reached with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends Title XV of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 by adding a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection. The curr_chunk defines the term 'agricultural trade program' as export promotion, credit, guarantee, bonus, or international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, excluding certain programs under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The curr_chunk defines 'covered foreign commodity' as wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US, excluding specific programs under various agricultural acts. The Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714c) defines key terms such as 'covered foreign commodity' as wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US, and 'person' as including exporters and participants in agricultural trade programs. SEC. 1582. MONITORING OF DOMESTIC USES MADE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COMMODITIES. The documentation for the entry of covered foreign commodities must include an end-use certificate meeting specific requirements. Consignees must submit quarterly reports certifying the percentage of the commodity used and confirming its use as stated in the end-use certificate. The end-use certificate and quarterly reports must certify the percentage of the covered foreign commodity used by the consignee and confirm its intended purpose or transfer details. The Secretary determines the necessary information for these documents. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required under subsection (a) must contain information such as the importer of record, consignee, country of origin, and quantity of the covered foreign commodity. The Secretary determines the necessary content for these documents. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports must include details like the consignee's name and address, country of origin, quantity, purpose of use, and transporter information for the covered foreign commodity. The quarterly report must include information on the consignee's end-use certificates, quantity of foreign commodity used, and details of the commodity's use during the quarter. The quarterly report must include details such as end-use certificates, quantity of foreign commodity used, consignee's use of the commodity, export quantity, commingling with US commodities, transfer to subsequent consignee, and change in end-use. The Secretary may require reporting of sales price of covered foreign commodities to facilitate enforcement of trade laws and agreements while ensuring confidentiality of purchasers. The Secretary sets sales price for enforcement of trade laws and agreements, ensuring confidentiality of purchasers. Entry of covered foreign commodities requires an end-use certificate. Penalties apply for non-compliance. Penalties for non-compliance with end-use certificate requirements include customs penalties and civil penalties of up to $10,000. The Secretary will establish regulations for implementing this section, including guidelines for quarterly report submission. SEC. 1583. Compliance provisions under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs in this subtitle. SEC. 1584. Suspension or debarment for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from an agricultural trade program for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms. The Corporation can waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. The Corporation can waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the use of a foreign agricultural commodity was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. This section and the amendment made by this section will become effective 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The Corporation can waive suspension or debarment if unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity is proven, with quantity less than 1 percent of the total."
