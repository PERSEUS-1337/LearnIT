The curr_chunk highlights the Universal Transformer and TransformerXL models, which aim to enhance the Transformer architecture. It also emphasizes the significance of interpretability and probing in neural models, particularly in the context of creating and applying probing tasks to trained models. Recent advances in probing tasks and methodologies have been applied to trained models, with a focus on creating more general purpose tasks. Various studies have probed models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1, analyzing both semantic and syntactic information. Specific frameworks like \"edge-probing\" have been proposed, with attention on different layers and performance measurements. Fine-tuned models are not extensively studied in these analyses. Various studies have analyzed models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1 through probing tasks, focusing on attention values in different layers and performance measurements. Some studies also use qualitative visual analysis to study models, such as CNNs and DNNs for tasks like phoneme recognition and speech recognition. Li et al. BID17 examine word vectors and the importance of specific dimensions in sequences. In the context of analyzing models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1 through probing tasks, Li et al. BID17 investigate word vectors and the significance of specific dimensions in sequences. They are motivated by previous work by Liu et al. BID20, who focused on probing pre-trained models like BERT but did not analyze fine-tuned models or specific phases. Our work focuses on analyzing fine-tuned BERT models by evaluating hidden states and token representations. We qualitatively examine transforming token vectors in vector space and probe their language transformations. In analyzing fine-tuned BERT models, we evaluate hidden states and token representations. We examine transforming token vectors qualitatively in vector space and probe language abilities quantitatively on QA-related tasks. The architecture of BERT allows us to track token transformations throughout the network, analyzing changes in token representations in each layer. For qualitative analysis, we select both correctly and falsely predicted samples from the test set and collect hidden states from each layer. We analyze token transformations in BERT models by evaluating hidden states and representations. Qualitative analysis involves selecting samples from the test set to collect hidden states from each layer, removing padding to observe token representations. Dimensionality reduction is applied to visualize token relations in two-dimensional space. BERT's pre-trained models use vector dimensions of 1024 (large model) and 512 (base model), and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE are applied to visualize token relations in two-dimensional space. K-means clustering is used to verify the distribution of clusters in high-dimensional vector space. The results of PCA show distinct clusters in the data, used to present findings. K-means clustering is applied to verify cluster distribution in high-dimensional space. The number of clusters is chosen based on PCA results. Semantic probing tasks are used to analyze information stored in transformed tokens after each layer in the model. The goal is to understand how BERT answers questions and maintains language information. Edge Probing principle is utilized for this analysis. The study utilizes Edge Probing to analyze information stored in transformed tokens after each layer in the model. Tasks include Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification, focusing on language understanding and reasoning. The study utilizes Edge Probing to analyze information stored in transformed tokens after each layer in the model. Tasks include Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, and Relation Classification, as prerequisites for language understanding and reasoning. Question Type Classification and Supporting Fact Identification are also added for Question Answering. Named Entity Labeling involves predicting entity categories based on Named Entity Recognition. Coreference Resolution predicts if two mentions refer to the same entity. Relation Classification predicts the relation type connecting two entities. The Coreference task involves predicting if two mentions refer to the same entity, while Relation Classification predicts the relation type connecting two known entities. Source code for all experiments will be made publicly available. Question Type Classification aims to identify the question type, using a dataset with 500 fine-grained question types. Question Type Classification involves correctly identifying the question type using a dataset with 500 fine-grained types of questions. Supporting Facts extraction is crucial for Question Answering tasks, especially in multihop cases. A probing task is constructed to understand how BERT distinguishes important context parts from distracting ones. BERT's token transformations are examined to understand how it distinguishes important context parts from distracting ones in multihop cases. A probing task is created to identify Supporting Facts, where the model predicts if a sentence contains relevant information for a specific question. Different probing tasks are constructed for each dataset to assess their ability to recognize relevant parts. The probing task involves identifying Supporting Facts by determining if a sentence contains relevant information for a specific question. The task is tailored for each dataset to evaluate their ability to recognize pertinent details. The input tokens for each probing task sample are embedded using a fine-tuned BERT model, considering all layers for classification. Only tokens of \"labeled edges\" within a sample are considered for classification, following the concept of Edge Probing. Contrary to previous work, we analyze all layers of BERT models (12 for BERT-base and 24 for BERT-large) using output embeddings from each layer. The Edge Probing concept focuses on tokens of \"labeled edges\" within a sample for classification. These tokens are pooled and input into a two-layer MLP classifier to predict label probabilities. We apply this process to pretrained BERT models without fine-tuning to understand the model's abilities in pre-training and fine-tuning for complex downstream tasks like Question Answering. Our analysis focuses on all layers of BERT models (12 for BERT-base and 24 for BERT-large) using output embeddings. We examine pretrained BERT models without fine-tuning to understand their abilities in complex downstream tasks like Question Answering. The datasets considered are SQUAD, bAbI, and HotpotQA, chosen intentionally for diverse results. Detention is a common punishment in the UK, Ireland, and other countries. Detention is a common punishment in the UK, Ireland, and other countries. HotpotQA dataset contains 112,000 question-answer pairs designed to combine information from multiple parts of a context. The distractor-task focuses on both supporting and distracting facts with an average context size of 900 words. The HotpotQA dataset consists of 112,000 question-answer pairs designed for Multihop QA tasks. The context includes supporting and distracting facts with an average size of 900 words. To accommodate the input size restriction of the pre-trained BERT model, the amount of distracting facts is reduced by a factor of 2.7. The bAbI tasks are artificial toy tasks aimed at understanding neural model abilities, requiring reasoning over multiple sentences and including Positional Reasoning, Argument Relation Extraction, and Coreference Resolution. The bAbI tasks are artificial toy tasks designed to understand neural model abilities, requiring reasoning over multiple sentences. The tasks differ in simplicity and have a vocabulary size of 230 with short contexts. The analysis is based on BERT BID8 and GPT-2 BID28 models, both Transformers that improve on previous ideas. Both BERT and GPT-2 are Transformer models that build upon previous ideas like ELMo and ULMFit. They have similar architectures, with GPT-2 focusing on the decoder half and BERT using both encoder and decoder. The models are fine-tuned on datasets and different hyperparameters are tuned for training. For our experiments, we utilize pre-trained BERT models such as bert-base-uncased and bert-large, along with the small GPT-2 model. These models are fine-tuned on specific datasets with tuned hyperparameters including learning rate and batch size. Evaluation is done every 1000 iterations, and the best model is selected for further analysis. Input length varies for different tasks, with a maximum of 512 tokens for HotpotQA. Additionally, both single-task and multitask models are evaluated for the bAbI task. The input length chosen varies for different tasks, with a maximum of 512 tokens for HotpotQA. Evaluation is done every 1000 iterations to select the best model for further analysis. For bAbI, both single-task and multitask models are evaluated, with a distinction between Span prediction and Sequence Classification. In HotpotQA, two tasks are distinguished: HotpotQA Support Only (SP) task and another task. In bAbI, span prediction is achieved by appending all possible answers to the base context. HotpotQA tasks include Support Only (SP) and Distractor tasks. Evaluation results show high accuracy on SQuAD task, while HotpotQA tasks are more challenging. The evaluation results of the best models show high accuracy on the SQuAD task, close to human performance. Tasks from HotpotQA are more challenging, with the distractor setting being the most difficult. BAbI tasks were easily solved by both BERT and GPT-2, with GPT-2 performing better on bAbI but worse on SQuAD and HotpotQA. BERT struggled with tasks requiring positional or geometric reasoning in the bAbI multi-task setting. BERT performs well on SQuAD and HotpotQA tasks, but struggles with tasks 17 and 19 in the bAbI dataset that require positional or geometric reasoning. GPT-2 shows improvement in these areas compared to BERT. Analysis results show recurring patterns in vector transformations, with comparisons of model performance displayed in figures. Results from probing tasks comparing different BERT models on various tasks are displayed in figures. The PCA representations of tokens in different layers show the model going through multiple phases while answering questions, observed across different QA tasks. These findings are supported by the results of probing tasks, revealing four distinct phases in the model's processing. In various QA tasks, BERT-based models go through four phases while answering questions. The early layers cluster tokens semantically, resembling Word2Vec embeddings but lacking task-specific information. Middle layers connect entities with mentions and attributes. In the middle layers of neural networks, entities are connected by their relation within a certain input context, forming task-specific clusters. These clusters help in answering questions by filtering question-relevant entities. In the middle layers of neural networks, task-specific clusters are formed by connecting entities based on their relations within a given context. These clusters aid in answering questions by filtering relevant entities. One such cluster involves countries, schools, detention, and country names, highlighting the common practice of detention in schools. Another cluster pertains to identifying facts about Emily being a wolf and wolves being afraid of cats. The model's ability to recognize entities, their mentions, and relations improves in higher network layers. The HotpotQA model shows clusters of coreferences, with improved entity recognition, coreference resolution, and relation recognition in higher network layers. BERT models exhibit similar patterns, with the model's performance peaking as it learns to match questions with supporting facts. BERT models demonstrate the ability to match questions with supporting facts by transforming tokens in the vector space, with stronger performance in higher layers. This behavior is observed in both BERT-base and BERT-large models. The BERT models show improved ability to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information in higher layers, as demonstrated in probing tasks. Performance for this task increases over successive layers for SQuAD and bAbI datasets. However, the fine-tuned HotpotQA model does not show significant improvement in accuracy compared to the model without fine-tuning. This indicates why the BERT model struggles with identifying correct Supporting Facts. Vector representations help in understanding which facts the model considers important, aiding in decision retracing and transparency. The BERT model struggles to identify correct Supporting Facts, leading to a performance drop in NLP tasks. Vector representations help in understanding important facts considered by the model, aiding in decision retracing and transparency. In the last layers, the model separates correct answer tokens from the rest, forming homogeneous clusters. Fine-tuning on HotpotQA results in a loss of information in last-layer representations. The BERT model struggles with identifying correct Supporting Facts, leading to a performance drop in NLP tasks. Fine-tuning on HotpotQA results in a loss of information in last-layer representations, affecting the model's ability to perform tasks like NEL or COREF. The phases of answering questions can be compared to human reasoning, involving semantic clustering and building relations between context parts. Separating important from irrelevant information and grouping potential answer candidates are crucial steps in the reasoning process. The BERT model's phases of answering questions involve semantic clustering, building relations between context parts, separating important from irrelevant information, and grouping potential answer candidates. Unlike humans who read sequentially, BERT can process all parts of the input simultaneously, allowing for concurrent phases depending on the task. Comparing insights from BERT to GPT-2 focuses on qualitative token representations, with probing tasks left for future analysis. In this section, we compare insights from BERT models to GPT-2. One major difference is that GPT-2 pays particular attention to the first token of a sequence, leading to a separation of clusters during dimensionality reduction. This issue is present in all layers of GPT-2 except for the Embedding Layer, the first Transformer block, and the last one. As a result, the first token is masked during further analysis. The dimensionality reduction in GPT-2 results in separating clusters, with particular focus on the first token. This issue is present in all layers except for specific blocks. GPT-2, like BERT, separates relevant information in the vector space but also extracts additional similar sentences. Unlike BERT, GPT-2 does not distinctly separate the correct answer. These findings suggest implications beyond BERT and extend to other Transformer networks, warranting further probing tasks for confirmation. The analysis in GPT-2 extends beyond BERT, showing that Transformer networks share similarities in how they handle meaning and semantics. Future work will involve more probing tasks to validate these initial observations. Visualizations can reveal failure states in neural networks, shedding light on when and why errors occur. The hidden state representations in neural networks can reveal insights into the difficulty of a task. For wrong predictions, early layers can provide clues on why the wrong candidate answer was chosen, such as selecting the wrong Supporting Fact or misresolution of coreferences. Low network confidence often leads to predictions far from the actual answer, resulting in different transformation phases. The text discusses how misresolution of coreferences and wrong supporting facts can lead to incorrect answers in neural networks. It also mentions that low network confidence can result in predictions that are far from the actual answer, with little impact from fine-tuning on the model's core NLP abilities. The network's confidence is generally low, maintaining 'Semantic Clustering' akin to Word2Vec. Fine-tuning has minimal impact on core NLP abilities, as the pretrained model already contains sufficient information for downstream tasks. Transfer Learning is successful as the model retains previous encoding during fitting. Positional embedding is crucial for Transformer network performance, addressing a key issue compared to RNNs. The model maintains positional embedding effects throughout layers, benefiting performance. Visualizations show relevance of positional embedding even in late layers. Fine-tuned model on SQuAD outperforms base model from layer 5 onwards, highlighting importance of resolving question types. The model fine-tuned on SQuAD outperforms the base model from layer 5 onwards, emphasizing the importance of resolving question types. Conversely, the model fine-tuned on bAbI tasks loses its ability to distinguish question types during fine-tuning due to the static structure of bAbI samples. The model fine-tuned on HotpotQA does not show improved performance compared to the model without fine-tuning. The model fine-tuned on bAbI tasks loses its ability to distinguish question types during fine-tuning. The model fine-tuned on HotpotQA does not outperform the model without fine-tuning. Transformer networks store interpretable information in hidden states, aiding in identifying misclassified examples and model weaknesses. The qualitative analysis of token vectors in Transformer models reveals interpretable information that can help identify misclassified examples and model weaknesses. Lower layers may be more suitable for certain problems in Transfer Learning tasks, suggesting the need for individual layer depth selection. Further research is recommended on skip connections in Transformer layers for direct information transfer. Transfer Learning tasks may benefit from choosing layer depth individually, as lower layers may be more applicable to certain problems. Research on skip connections in Transformer layers is suggested for direct information transfer between non-adjacent layers. Specific layers in Transformer networks seem to solve different problems, hinting at modularity that can be exploited in training processes. This work aims to reveal internal processes within Transformer-based models.
