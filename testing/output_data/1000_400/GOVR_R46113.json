    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the ultimately enacted appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and a list of CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The CRS report on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The report does not provide in-depth analysis of specific issues related to mandatory funding or follow other legislation related to DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. It explains budgetary concepts such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act. The curr_chunk explains budgetary concepts related to homeland security appropriations, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to spending caps. It references additional resources for a more detailed discussion on these terms. Amounts in CRS reports represent budget authority, with calculations using unrounded data for precision. The curr_chunk provides details on the data sources for FY2019 homeland security appropriations, including the use of unrounded data for calculations. It mentions specific legislation, such as P.L. 116-6 and P.L. 116-20, for appropriations and supplemental funding. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019 draws supplemental appropriations data from enacted measures like P.L. 116-20 and P.L. 116-26 for natural disaster response, border security, and humanitarian assistance. FY2020 requested, House Appropriations Committee-recommended, Senate Appropriations Committee-recommended, and enacted levels data are sourced from specific legislative documents. The levels of annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security are sourced from specific legislative documents, including H.Rept. 116-180 for H.R. 3931, S.Rept. 116-125 for S. 2582, and the explanatory statement for P.L. 116-93. The scoring methodology is consistent and developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology, with no attempt to compare with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data due to technical scoring differences. The CRS methodology for DHS appropriations does not compare data with OMB due to scoring differences. OMB data on mandatory spending is no longer included in the report.

The Senate committee bill also included $17.35 billion of disaster relief-designated funding, $3.28 billion more than the Administration's modified request, and $190 million in OCO-designated funding for the Coast Guard. Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. 116-59) on September 27, 2019, temporarily extending funding at the FY2019 rate for operations through November 21. The CR was subsequently extended through December 20 and included provisions addressing needs of DHS under a CR, such as special apportionment of funds for Secret Service expenses related to the FY2020 presidential campaign and an accelerated rate of apportionment for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).

When DHS was established in 2003, resources were provided through existing structures rather than creating a new appropriations system. When DHS was established in 2003, resources were provided through existing structures rather than creating a new appropriations system. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. Operating with over 70 different appropriations and 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities hindered transparency and decision-making. DHS implemented a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) in FY2017 to streamline budgeting and decision-making processes. The CAS converted legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development. This change aimed to enhance transparency and simplify spending decisions within the department. The DHS implemented a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) in FY2017, converting legacy appropriations into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development.

Some appropriations, such as Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay, have unique funding mechanisms with specific directives on how funds can be used. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) account allows funds to be spent for its mission without impacting total discretionary spending. The US Coast Guard's Retired Pay appropriation covers retired personnel entitlements and does not count against discretionary allocation. FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund receives a separate appropriation for its operations. The government has a legal obligation to make payments for retired personnel entitlements, which do not count against discretionary spending. FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and National Flood Insurance Fund have separate appropriations for their activities, allowing for better tracking and transparency of funds. The National Flood Insurance Program is largely mandatory spending, but some functions are paid for through discretionary appropriations. Certain program costs are covered by fees collected by the government, which require appropriations language to be spent. This includes operating expenses, commissions, interest on borrowings, and flood mitigation actions. Prior to FY2017, appropriations included directions on how the budget should be used. The National Flood Insurance Program covers operating expenses, commissions, interest on borrowings, and flood mitigation actions through discretionary appropriations.

The federal government spending process involves budget authority enacted by Congress, funds obligated by federal agencies, and payments made to liquidate those obligations. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, and agencies are prohibited from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may also be indefinite in amount. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis, with unobligated funds at the end of the year no longer available for spending. Multiyear budget authority specifies a range of time for spending, while no-year budget authority is available for an indefinite period. Budget authority is available for obligation during a specific fiscal year, with unobligated funds no longer available for spending at the end of that year. Multiyear budget authority allows funds to be obligated over a specified time period, while no-year budget authority is available for an indefinite period. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions, creating a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays represent the actual funds spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority can be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future year, especially with certain contracts. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress. Gross budget authority for federal agencies includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs require yearly appropriations. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds are also collected. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions, not considered federal revenue but counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset agency discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is funded by permanent appropriations, while Coast Guard retirement pay is funded by annual appropriations. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs such as the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is funded by permanent appropriations, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate the gross budget authority. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among congressional committees through 302(a) allocations. These allocations include discretionary totals available for enactment in annual appropriations bills. Appropriations committees further allocate these funds among subcommittees for each appropriations bill. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These amounts, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year as appropriations bills progress towards enactment. Table A-1 displays comparable figures for FY2020 302(b) allocations. The 302(b) allocations may be adjusted during the year by the respective appropriations committee issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment. A series of amendments were offered and adopted in the House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill that put the bill over its 302(b) discretionary allocation. This scoring was later revised. The provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The FY2020 DHS appropriations bill faced amendments that exceeded its discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending, with subsequent legislation amending those caps. Most of the DHS budget is considered nondefense spending, with allowances for adjustments to cover specific funding needs. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense, with subsequent legislation amending the caps. Most of the DHS budget is nondefense spending, with allowances for adjustments to cover specific funding needs like overseas operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. The DHS appropriations process includes discretionary budget authority adjustments for emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by OMB under the Budget Control Act until FY2019, with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amending the formula to increase the adjustment size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the allowable adjustment for disaster relief by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters. In August 2019, OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2020 at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history, calculated from the 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The estimated allowable adjustment for FY2020 is $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history, calculated from the 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final amount may still vary."
