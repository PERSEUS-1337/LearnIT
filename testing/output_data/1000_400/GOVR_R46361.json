The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities in FY2020, with $718.3 billion allocated for the military activities of the Department of Defense. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities in FY2020, with $718.3 billion allocated for the military activities of the Department of Defense. Of the amount requested for DOD, $689.5 billion fell within the scope of the annual defense appropriations bill, along with $1.1 billion for certain expenses of the intelligence community. The bill does not include funding for military construction and family housing, which is provided by a separate appropriations bill. The FY2020 defense bill does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or $7.8 billion for TRICARE for Life program. The Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. DOD has organized its budget requests post-9/11 attacks to designate funding for related activities. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. Since 2009, non-base budget funds have been designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) due to the Budget Control Act of 2011. Since 2009, non-base budget funds have been designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to avoid exceeding statutory spending caps. The FY2020 budget included $97.9 billion in OCO funding to supplement the base budget for defense-related programs. The FY2020 defense budget request was $576.2 billion, with an additional $97.9 billion designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the defense spending cap to $666.5 billion for FY2020. The House passed H.R. 2740 incorporating the defense appropriations bill on June 19, 2019. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with a compromise version agreed upon by negotiators. The bill was incorporated into H.R. 1158 and passed by both chambers. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Nita Lowey provided an Explanatory Statement in the absence of a formal conference report. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill, incorporated into H.R. 1158, reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy. This marks a change from past U.S. national security policy, with a renewed focus on competition between nuclear-armed powers. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill reflects a shift in strategic emphasis towards competition between nuclear-armed powers, marking a change from past U.S. national security policy focused on countering terrorism and regional aggressors. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill reflects a shift in strategic emphasis towards competition between nuclear-armed powers, moving away from past focus on countering terrorism and regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea have raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea have heightened concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. This has underscored the importance of competing with other great powers in the U.S. national security agenda, alongside ongoing threats such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. The national security agenda includes competing with great powers willing to use military force unilaterally. Challenges from the end of the Cold War, such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, remain serious threats. Adversaries collaborate to achieve shared objectives, using social and economic tools. Some states work with non-state proxies, blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. Managing these complex security issues is more challenging than in the past. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. This shift in strategy aims to address the evolving security environment characterized by various threats including militias, criminal networks, and hackers. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy prioritize great power competition with China and Russia, aiming to enhance the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. The strategy acknowledges the erosion of U.S. military capabilities compared to Chinese and Russian threats, emphasizing the need to address external threats such as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy prioritize great power competition with China and Russia, aiming to enhance the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. The NDS views retaining the U.S. strategic competitive edge relative to China and Russia as a higher priority than countering violent extremist organizations, forming a \"2+3\" strategy to address primary challenges (China and Russia) and additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Annual federal government outlays have increased significantly since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. The \"2+3\" strategy focuses on countering primary challenges (China and Russia) and additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Federal government spending has increased significantly since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid growing the fastest. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to control federal spending through sequestration if discretionary spending budgets exceeded set caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) established annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending by $1.0 trillion through FY2021. Sequestration enforces automatic cancellation of appropriations if spending exceeds the caps, with exceptions for emergency and OCO funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits on defense-related spending, with exceptions for emergency and OCO funding. Congress has raised the spending caps, but the national defense spending cap for FY2020 remained at $576 billion. To avoid a reduction in defense spending, the Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the cap, while also including $165 billion in OCO funding. The Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the defense spending cap set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, the request also included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funded a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but included a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength due to not meeting higher goals in FY2018. The Administration's FY2020 budget includes a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but reduces the Army's end-strength by 7,500 due to not meeting higher goals in FY2018. The budget also funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and allocates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorizes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and allocates funds for various programs, including $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office and $35.0 million for the Special Victims' Counsel program. Additionally, $3.0 million is provided for a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma. $110 million is added to the childcare program, making it the largest in the US.

Additionally, $3.0 million is provided for a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma. The act also added $110 million to the childcare program, making it the largest in the US. The program caters to nearly 200,000 children of uniformed service members and DOD civilians. The act requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with a detailed report on DOD's childcare system and plans for its expansion. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorizes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and allocates funds for various programs, including DOD's childcare system expansion plans and modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons. The Act supports the development of long-range missiles with hypersonic speed capabilities. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorizes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and funds programs like DOD's childcare system expansion and modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons, including hypersonic missiles. These hypersonic weapons can travel at speeds five times the speed of sound and maneuver throughout their flight trajectory, making them a priority for DOD due to developments by China and Russia. Funding has been secured from Congress to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) prioritizes hypersonic weapons development due to threats from China and Russia. Congress has provided funding to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program, including additional funds for defense against hypersonic missiles and the creation of a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office. These weapons are challenging to detect and intercept due to their high speed, maneuverability, and low altitude flight. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) prioritizes hypersonic weapons development to counter threats from China and Russia. The act allocated $100 million to establish a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office for coordinating R&D programs. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of efforts and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. The missile defense budget request aligned with the Administration's proposals to enhance defenses against ballistic missile attacks. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) supported the Administration's proposals to strengthen defenses against ballistic missile attacks, including shifting funds among components to defend U.S. territory against ICBMs due to the cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle program. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) allocated $515.0 million to develop an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) and their kill vehicle. Additionally, $285 million was provided for additional GBI missiles and support equipment, and $180 million for R&D to enhance GBI reliability. Congress also approved funding for military space satellites and satellite launches, including $40.0 million for the newly created Space Force.

The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act supported the Army's plan to upgrade its ground-combat vehicle fleet, including increasing firepower with a 30 mm cannon effective against personnel and lightly armored vehicles. The act raised concerns about congressional support for the Army's strategy, as funds for new programs were taken from future budgets meant for upgrades to existing systems like Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. Planned upgrades to legacy systems would be delayed to prioritize development of new systems. The Army's plan to upgrade its ground-combat vehicle fleet includes increasing firepower with a 30 mm cannon. Funds for new programs were taken from future budgets meant for upgrades to existing systems like Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The enacted bill provides less than requested for Bradley upgrades but nearly triple the amount requested for the Chinook upgrade. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees challenged the appropriations in their respective versions of the bill. The Army's plan to upgrade its ground-combat vehicle fleet includes increasing firepower with a 30 mm cannon. The enacted bill appropriated $46.2 million for the Chinook upgrade, challenging the Army's decision to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet. Additionally, the bill provided $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, addressing concerns about its technological ambition and streamlined acquisition process. The Army's plan to upgrade its ground-combat vehicle fleet includes increasing firepower with a 30 mm cannon.
