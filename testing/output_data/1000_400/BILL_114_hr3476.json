    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" set tight spending caps and required deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. Despite unsuccessful negotiations, a sequester occurred in fiscal year 2013, leading to lawmakers reaching an agreement. Lawmakers negotiated a two-year agreement in response to the initial sequester in fiscal year 2013, setting higher levels of defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. A similar agreement is needed to avoid deep budget cuts in the upcoming fiscal year starting on October 1, 2015. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the defense spending cuts under sequestration. Budget cuts in the new fiscal year, starting on October 1, 2015, have been criticized by Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry for undermining the capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization of the armed forces. The impact of the cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is also becoming increasingly clear, with NDD United highlighting the negative effects of these self-imposed cuts. The impact of budget cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is becoming increasingly clear, affecting economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, scientific discovery, infrastructure, and emergency response. This is evident in the bills reported by the House Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2016. The sequester's impact includes hindering scientific discovery, eroding infrastructure, and threatening emergency response. House Committee bills for fiscal year 2016 propose cuts to education, housing vouchers, and veterans affairs funding. Eliminating the sequester would aid economic recovery, as per the Congressional Budget Office. The sequester's negative effects on defense, future investments, and economic recovery can be mitigated by eliminating it. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that doing so would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, leading to the creation of 500,000 jobs next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would also allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation before the fiscal year begins, preventing a government shutdown like the 16-day one in 2013. Providing relief from the sequester will prevent another Government shutdown, as seen in the 16-day shutdown in 2013 which had significant negative impacts on the economy, including job losses, delayed tax refunds, and disruptions to essential services like food safety inspections. To prevent another Government shutdown and fund vital services at necessary levels for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are needed. This should include raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. Congress should consider offsetting the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing special interest tax loopholes. To prevent a Government shutdown and fund services for fiscal year 2016, negotiations on a budget agreement are necessary. This should involve raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. Congress should aim to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members appointed by the Speaker of the House will be responsible for negotiating the measure. The Speaker of the House will determine the number of individuals to negotiate a measure for increasing discretionary spending limits. Approval of the measure will require a majority of appointed individuals, with consideration under specified procedures. The measure described in subsection (a) requires approval from a majority of appointed individuals. If approved, it will be considered under specific procedures outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011, with certain date substitutions. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust the discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This includes changes to dollar amounts in various paragraphs. In section 251A, adjustments are made to discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Any adjustments made before the enactment of this Act by the Office of Management and Budget will be null if the measure under section 2(a) is not passed before October 1, 2015."
