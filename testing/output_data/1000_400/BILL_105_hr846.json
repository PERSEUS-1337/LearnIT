    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position, the taxpayer must recognize gain as if the position were sold for its fair market value on the date of the sale. Any gain will be included in the taxable year of the sale. Adjustments will be made for subsequent gains or losses, and the holding period will be determined as if the position was acquired on the date of the constructive sale. The term 'appreciated financial position' refers to any position with potential gain if sold, including stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest. A taxpayer is considered to have made a constructive sale of such a position, triggering recognition of gain as if sold at fair market value on the sale date. The holding period is adjusted as if the position was acquired on the date of the constructive sale. The term 'position' includes interests like futures, short sales, or options. A taxpayer is treated as having made a constructive sale if they engage in certain transactions with the same or similar property. The term 'constructive sale' includes engaging in transactions with the same or similar property, such as futures contracts or short sales. This does not apply to transactions marked to market. The term 'constructive sale' encompasses transactions with similar property, excluding those marked to market or involving nonpublicly traded property. The term 'constructive sale' excludes certain transactions involving nonmarketable securities, and transactions closed by the end of the taxable year are disregarded. In transactions where gain or loss is recognized, any other transaction that would be treated as a constructive sale must meet certain conditions, including not entering into a similar transaction within 31 days. Related persons are defined in relation to transactions under section 267. For purposes of this section, a transaction must not be entered into within a 31-day period after it is closed. Related persons are defined based on relationships described in section 267 or 707(b), with transactions entered into to avoid the purposes of this section. Positions in interest rates are considered substantially identical to debt instruments for paragraph (1)(A) purposes. The term 'forward contract' includes fully or partially prepaid forward contracts. Positions in interest rates are treated as substantially identical to debt instruments. A forward contract includes fully or partially prepaid contracts. An offsetting notional principal contract involves paying the investment yield on a property in exchange for reimbursement for any decline in value. The text discusses special rules regarding the subsequent sale of a position that was deemed sold through a constructive sale. If an appreciated financial position is constructively sold and then subsequently sold or disposed of while the initial transaction is still open, the taxpayer's other appreciated financial positions are considered for constructive sale purposes. For constructive sale purposes, if a position is deemed sold and then subsequently sold or disposed of while the initial transaction is still open, the taxpayer's other appreciated financial positions are considered. Trust interests actively traded are treated as stock, and the specific property deemed sold in a constructive sale is determined similarly to an actual sale. The taxpayer's trust interests actively traded are treated as stock for constructive sale purposes. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the section's purposes.
