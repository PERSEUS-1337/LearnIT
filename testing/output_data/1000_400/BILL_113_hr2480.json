The \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" aims to address the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers, particularly nurses and nursing assistants, caused by patient lifting and transferring. This leads to chronic back pain and significant risk to their health and well-being, resulting in many leaving the profession. The physical demands of the nursing profession lead to many nurses leaving due to chronic back pain and other health issues. Patients are also at risk during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning, but mechanical lift programs can reduce injuries and improve patient safety. Assistive patient handling technology and equipment have made manual patient handling outdated in nursing care. Health care facilities implementing safe patient handling technology have seen a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. Health care facilities implementing safe patient handling technology have reported positive results, including a decline in injuries among nursing staff and health care workers. This has led to a decrease in lost work days due to injury and staff turnover. States have also implemented safe patient handling standards, showing the feasibility of such programs. Implementing safe patient handling technology has successfully reduced workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. States have adopted standards for injury prevention, demonstrating the feasibility of such programs. Establishing these standards for healthcare workers is crucial for their safety and addressing the nursing shortage. The text chunk discusses the Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard, which is crucial for healthcare workers' safety and addressing the nursing shortage. The Secretary of Labor must establish an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within one year of this Act's enactment. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, with a final standard to be implemented within two years. The standard will mandate the use of engineering and safety controls for patient handling. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard must be established within 2 years of the Act's enactment. It will require the use of engineering controls and technology to minimize injuries from manual patient handling by healthcare workers. Alternative measures, such as lift teams, will be required where mechanical technology is not feasible. The standard applies to all healthcare employers. The standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention must be established within 2 years. It will require the use of engineering controls and technology to minimize injuries from manual patient handling. Alternative measures, like trained lift teams, will be required when technology is not feasible. All healthcare employers must comply with the standard, which includes developing and implementing a program within 6 months. The final standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention requires healthcare employers to implement a program within 6 months, including hazard identification and control measures. Within 2 years, employers must purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment and technology as determined by the Secretary. Input from healthcare workers, including direct care registered nurses, is also required. The final standard mandates healthcare employers to implement a safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program within 6 months. Employers must purchase necessary equipment and technology determined by the Secretary within 2 years. Input from healthcare workers, including direct care registered nurses, is required in developing and implementing the program. Employers must also establish a data tracking and review program to analyze relevant data. Each health care employer must establish a review program to analyze data relevant to their safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program. They must make their findings available to health care workers, their representatives, collective bargaining agents, and federal agencies upon request. Each health care employer must consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling. They are also required to provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices on an annual basis. Health care employers must train workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies annually. Training should cover musculoskeletal hazards and be interactive. Employers must also post a notice of safe patient handling rights. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for health care employers to post a notice explaining safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, as well as procedures for reporting related injuries and health care workers' rights under the Act. The curr_chunk emphasizes the annual evaluation of the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program, including procedures, technology selection, injury assessment, and involvement of healthcare workers and their representatives. The evaluation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program includes assessment of injuries, new technology, and devices. Health care employers must involve nurses, healthcare workers, and their representatives in the evaluation process. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards. Each health care employer must have procedures in place for employees to refuse duties if they believe it would violate safety standards and cause harm. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with these standards. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards for health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments will apply one year after the issuance date. The amendments made to the Social Security Act include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards for health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. These changes will apply one year after the final standard is issued. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish states' authority to enact laws providing equal or greater protections for employees. Rights of health care workers under federal or state law are retained. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" \"employment,\" and \"handling\" in relation to healthcare workers and their responsibilities. The term \"employment\" in the Act includes providing services under a contract or other arrangement. \"Handling\" encompasses actions like lifting, transferring, or moving patients that pose a risk of musculoskeletal injury. A \"health care employer\" refers to facilities employing direct-care registered nurses or other health care workers. An employer in the healthcare industry includes outpatient facilities, hospitals, nursing homes, and other similar facilities that employ direct-care registered nurses and health care workers. Health care workers are individuals assigned by employers to handle patients, including nurses and independent contractors. A lift team consists of health care workers trained in safe patient handling practices."
