    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM is the lead agency responsible for developing these programs, which involve multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and final leasing schedules submitted to the President and Congress. The DOI creates five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters under the OCSLA. The process involves examining all leasing areas, narrowing down based on economic and environmental analysis, and submitting a final leasing schedule to the President and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior must then submit each program for review and comment for at least 60 days before approval. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA, which considers alternatives and addresses public comments from stakeholders. The planning process for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) that examines potential environmental impacts and considers alternatives. Public comments from stakeholders are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program without restarting the development process, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. On November 18, 2016, BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022. The final version of the oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was released by BOEM on November 18, 2016. It includes 11 lease sales on the OCS, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Three sales proposed earlier were not included in the final program. Former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell approved the program on January 17, 2017. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 includes 11 lease sales on the OCS: 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Congress plays a role in the planning process but does not have approval authority over the program. Members of Congress can influence the program by submitting public comments and evaluating it in committee. Under the OCSLA, Congress does not approve or disapprove of BOEM's final program, but Members can influence it by submitting public comments, evaluating it in committee, and introducing legislation. The 114th Congress utilized these methods to influence the proposed program for 2017-2022. The report discusses the legal framework, development process, previous programs, and analysis of the 2017-2022 program. Congressional oversight and legislation are key aspects of Congress's role in the process. The report discusses the history and legal framework for BOEM's offshore oil and gas leasing programs, development process, previous programs, and analysis of the 2017-2022 program. Congress plays a role in oversight and legislation related to the program, with jurisdiction established by the Submerged Lands Act in 1953. In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA to address jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States, including regulation of subsurface oil and natural gas exploration. The Submerged Lands Act grants coastal states rights up to 3 geographical miles from their coasts, while the OCSLA defines the OCS as submerged lands under U.S. jurisdiction. The OCSLA aims for expedited development of OCS resources with environmental safeguards and national needs in mind. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18 mandating the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. The 1978 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments introduced Section 18, requiring the establishment of a five-year OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs. This program, initiated by the DOI in 1980, sets schedules for lease auctions and governs OCS oil and gas exploration and production. Subsequent to the 1978 amendments, Congress has made additional changes affecting offshore oil and gas activities, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 aimed at promoting exploration and production in deep water. Since the 1978 OCSLA Amendments, Congress has made various changes to offshore oil and gas activities. The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 encouraged deepwater exploration by providing royalty relief. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain regions and revenue sharing with Gulf states. Congress also removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions starting in 2008, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The OCSLA Amendments since 1978 have led to changes in offshore oil and gas activities, including the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. Congress removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions starting in 2008, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program, considering economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources and potential impacts on marine, coastal, and human environments. The leasing program consists of proposed lease sales for a five-year period to meet national energy needs. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to consider economic, social, and environmental values of OCS resources and potential impacts on marine, coastal, and human environments when preparing an oil and gas leasing program. This program includes proposed lease sales for a five-year period to meet national energy needs. Section 18 directs the Secretary to schedule oil and gas exploration based on various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws. Leasing must also ensure fair market value for lands leased and rights conveyed by the Federal Government. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to consider economic, social, and environmental values of OCS resources when preparing an oil and gas leasing program for a five-year period. The program must ensure fair market value for lands leased and rights conveyed by the Federal Government, and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. Consultation with various federal agencies, the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and potentially affected states is required during program preparation. The OCSLA mandates consultation with federal agencies, the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and potentially affected states when preparing an oil and gas leasing program. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to the governor of each affected state for comments at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, can submit comments on competition effects. The OCSLA mandates consultation with federal agencies, the Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission, and potentially affected states when preparing an oil and gas leasing program. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to the governor of each affected state for comments at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, can submit comments on competition effects. Subsequently, the Secretary must submit the proposed program to Congress and the President for approval, along with explanations for any recommendations not accepted. The Secretary can then approve a final five-year program, with the ability to revise it at any time through a mandated review process. The OCSLA allows the Secretary to approve a final five-year program and revise it as needed. The Secretary's responsibilities are carried out by BOEM, which consults with affected states and publishes the proposed program in the Federal Register. Other federal regulations guide the five-year planning process. The OCSLA allows the Secretary to approve a final five-year program and revise it as needed through BOEM. Governors of affected states are requested to identify specific laws, goals, and policies for consideration. NEPA and CZMA are federal statutes that play a significant role in the program's formation, requiring environmental impact statements and assessments for major federal actions. Under the OCSLA, federal agencies must prepare environmental impact statements for major actions affecting the environment. BOEM's five-year programs are assumed to have a significant impact, leading to the preparation of a programmatic EIS alongside the program development. This process is detailed in the report. States must comply with CZMA requirements. The CZMA encourages states to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance and must address water pollution sources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) encourages states to develop plans for habitat and resource protection. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance and must address water pollution sources. The CZMA also requires federal compliance with state programs in activities like oil and gas development. The regulations require BOEM to consider the coastal zone management program of affected coastal states before developing the leasing program. The development process involves multiple drafts for review, consultation with state governors and federal agencies, and public comment. Individual lease sales also undergo environmental review and public comment after the program takes effect. The development process for oil and gas leasing programs involves multiple drafts for review, consultation with state governors and federal agencies, and public comment. Individual lease sales also undergo environmental review and public comment after the program takes effect, leading to actual oil and gas production in individual wells. The drafting process for the five-year oil and gas leasing program involves multiple stages of analysis and review. Successive drafts represent a narrowing down of proposed lease sales based on environmental factors and public input. Changes can only involve removing proposed sales, not adding new ones, without restarting the environmental review process. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) can remove proposed lease sales in the final version of the plan but cannot add new sales without restarting the environmental review process. The process begins with a Request for Information (RFI) to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. The 2017-2022 leasing program RFI received over half a million comments. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published a draft proposed program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, which includes analysis of OCS planning areas for lease sales over the next five years. The DPP is the initial proposal leading to BOEM's final program, following a Request for Information (RFI) that gathered input on energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. The DPP for the 2017-2022 leasing program analyzes OCS planning areas for lease sales over the next five years. BOEM published the DPP on January 29, 2015, with a comment period that closed on March 30, 2015, receiving over 1 million comments. A notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) was also issued for public input on the proposed lease areas. The BOEM published a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for proposed lease areas and sought public input through a scoping process. The agency also published a proposed program (PP) for the 2017-2022 period, refining lease sale locations and timing. The PP was accompanied by a draft PEIS for analysis of OCS areas. The BOEM refines proposed lease sale locations and timing for OCS oil and gas sales. The agency submits the Proposed Program (PP) to Congress, state governors, and federal agencies, seeking public comment. The PP for 2017-2022 was published on March 15, 2016, with a comment period closing on June 16, 2016. A draft PEIS analyzing OCS areas for leasing was also released. The Final Program/Final PEIS (PFP) is based on additional analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments on the PP. The PFP is announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The PFP, based on analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments, is submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. Congress does not have approval authority, but legislation could influence the program outcome. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, making it final. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior approved the final program on January 17, 2017. Previous five-year programs dating back to 1980 have also been approved by Congress. Since 1980, multiple five-year programs have been submitted to Congress, reflecting different presidential administrations' offshore oil and gas leasing policies. The 2012-2017 program, under the Obama Administration, included 15 proposed lease sales in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The 2012-2017 five-year program submitted to Congress by the Obama Administration included 15 proposed lease sales for offshore energy development, following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The program consisted of 12 sales in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 in the Alaska region, with 11 lease sales held by late November 2016. In contrast, the 2007-2012 program, under the George W. Bush Administration, had 21 scheduled sales reflecting their policies on domestic energy production and environmental protection. The 2007-2012 five-year program was submitted to Congress under the Bush Administration's direction, with a schedule of 21 sales. The Obama Administration later resubmitted the program in 2010 with a revised schedule of 16 sales, of which 11 were held before the program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan was submitted under the George W. Bush Administration's policies on energy production. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1997-2002 program had 16 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. The 1992-1997 program had a schedule presented to Congress in 1992, with details on sales. The submission of lease sales for various OCS oil and gas leasing programs from 1982 to 2002 was consistent with national energy policies established during different administrations. The programs included multiple sales held before their respective expiration dates. The 1980-1982, 1982-1987, and 1987-1992 OCS oil and gas leasing programs were presented to Congress under different administrations, reflecting national energy policies. Multiple lease sales were held before each program expired. The original Section 18 submission for domestic oil and gas leasing was prepared in 1978 and presented to Congress in 1980 under President Carter's direction. The program included 36 proposed sales, with 12 held. Prior to 1980, almost 30 years of federal lease sales occurred. In 2016, BOEM released the final version of its offshore leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions. Prior to 1980, federal government lease sales for oil and gas encompassed almost 30 years, conveying over 3,000 tracts. In 2016, BOEM released the final version of its offshore leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions, including the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015. The 2017-2022 final program schedules lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production declined from 31% to 16% of total production between FY2010 and FY2015, while offshore natural gas production fell from 9.5% to 4% during the same period. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production between FY2010 and FY2015 is attributed to increased production of shale gas and shale oil in onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford. This increase has helped reduce imports, particularly from OPEC countries, as onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs compared to deepwater plays being explored offshore. The surge in U.S. oil production from onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford has reduced imports from OPEC countries. Onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs than deepwater plays. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS. The Energy Information Administration anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over 2015-2020. In a low oil and natural gas price environment, the demand for new offshore leases is soft, impacting future production levels. The Energy Information Administration anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over the 2015-2020 period. Estimates by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue show a decrease in bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years. For example, in the most recent FY2017 budget request, estimated bonus bid revenues were around $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. In the FY2015 budget request, offshore bonus bid revenues were estimated at around $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019, but in the FY2017 budget request, the estimate dropped to $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates also decreased from $80-$90 per barrel to $50-$60 per barrel. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels in 2017. The EIA anticipates record levels of offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017, with new deepwater projects contributing. Energy diversification is vital, and new production from other OCS regions can also meet energy needs. Oil and gas exploration proceeds in stages, with increasing data certainty about resource volumes. Undiscovered resources are estimated before drilling, and discovered oil and gas volumes are measured within pools. Oil and gas exploration and production proceed in stages, with increasing data certainty about resource volumes. Reserves are measured within pools or fields via well penetration or technology. U.S. OCS areas have reported reserves, with 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil estimated. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS due to no discoveries. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources include 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas, with the majority in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Chukchi and Beaufort Seas hold significant oil and gas reserves, with the majority of resources located in these regions. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) must consider resource potential, environmental impacts, and other factors when developing five-year programs under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Some areas of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. Some areas of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. This included areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, as well as certain ocean areas in the Alaska region withdrawn by President Obama. President Obama withdrew certain ocean areas in the Alaska region from leasing consideration for the 2017-2022 program, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also off-limits for future oil and gas leasing activities. Additional withdrawals were made under the OCSLA in December 2016. President Obama withdrew certain ocean areas in the Alaska region from leasing consideration for the 2017-2022 program, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico, as well as areas in the U.S. Arctic, were withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing activities by the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Presidents. The President withdrew certain ocean areas in the North Bering Sea and Atlantic Ocean from leasing consideration. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 program but will affect future leasing for five-year programs. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each ocean region based on criteria such as resource potential, infrastructure, environmental issues, and state interests. BOEM considers various factors for leasing, including resource potential, infrastructure, environmental issues, and state interests. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales in the Atlantic or Pacific regions. Previous proposals for an Atlantic lease sale and two Alaska lease sales were not included. The program offers almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources for leasing. The 2017-2022 program by BOEM includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, excluding the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The Gulf region, with abundant resources and industry interest, accounts for 97% of U.S. offshore oil and gas production. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama support offshore activities, leading to the majority of lease sales being scheduled in the Gulf region. The Gulf region, with strong industry support, accounts for 97% of U.S. offshore oil and gas production. Majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in the Gulf region, with 10 out of 11 proposed sales. The region includes three BOEM planning areas: Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf, with some areas closed to leasing due to moratoriums. Region-wide sales are now offered instead of area-specific sales in the Gulf planning areas. The 2017-2022 program for oil and gas leasing in the Gulf region has replaced area-specific sales with region-wide sales to provide greater flexibility to industry. This change allows for more frequent bidding on lease blocks and better planning for exploring resources that may straddle the U.S.-Mexico boundary. The final program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf compared to previous five-year programs. The final program for oil and gas leasing in the Gulf region schedules fewer lease sales compared to previous programs, with a focus on region-wide sales to provide flexibility to industry. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the lower number of lease sales, but BOEM attributes this decrease to the consolidation of area-specific sales in the Gulf. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has also increased. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreased summer polar ice, allowing for longer drilling seasons and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources. Challenges include severe weather, sea ice, and lack of infrastructure. Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with federal leases, with Beaufort having producing wells. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in the Alaska region are the only areas with existing federal leases for offshore oil and gas exploration. While some stakeholders support expanding these activities, others, including environmental groups, have concerns about potential oil spills and their impact on climate change. The Obama Administration has shown support for exploration in the Arctic while also implementing safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Groups oppose offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic due to concerns about oil spills and climate change. The Obama Administration supported Arctic exploration but also implemented safety regulations. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 citing market conditions. The final program removed sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. Despite significant resources and state support, sales were removed in favor of existing leases and concerns about Arctic ecosystem and industry interest in exploration and development. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. The decision was based on factors such as existing leases, the unique Arctic ecosystem, declining industry interest, and sufficient domestic energy sources. Industry interest in Arctic OCS declined significantly, with companies relinquishing leases due to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. The BOEM observed a significant decline in industry interest in the Arctic OCS, leading to the cancellation of lease sales in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Companies relinquished leases due to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in 2015. President Obama later withdrew portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration. BOEM concluded that Arctic lease sales were not immediately necessary due to strong domestic energy supply. President Obama withdrew parts of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration. The final 2017-2022 program excludes an Atlantic lease sale proposed in the DPP version. Congressional bans and presidential moratoria have limited oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years. The lack of oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years was due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria. Changes in legislation allowed for potential lease sales in the Atlantic, but as of December 2016, no sales had taken place. Certain parts of the Atlantic are currently under presidential moratorium. The legislative changes allowed for potential lease sales in the Atlantic region, but as of December 2016, no sales had occurred. Certain parts of the Atlantic are currently under presidential moratorium, while other areas are available for leasing. BOEM analyzed various factors for the region, including resource potential, safety concerns, and competing land uses. The BOEM analyzed factors for potential lease sales in the Atlantic region, considering resource potential, safety concerns, and competing land uses. Despite initial plans for a lease sale in 2021, the Atlantic sale was later removed due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, current market dynamics, and feedback from Governors of affected states. Conflicts with existing uses like tourism, fishing, shipping, and transportation were cited as reasons for the removal. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and feedback from Governors of affected states. Conflicts with existing uses like tourism, fishing, shipping, and transportation were cited as reasons for the removal. The agency also considered the lack of offshore mineral production history in the Atlantic compared to the Gulf of Mexico. The decision not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period was influenced by concerns from various stakeholders and the broader U.S. energy situation. BOEM noted that domestic oil and gas production has been strong, making additional production from the Atlantic lease unnecessary. Similarly, no lease sales are scheduled for the Pacific region in the 2017-2022 program, with the last federal oil and gas lease sale in the region dating back to 1984. The 2017-2022 program schedules no lease sales for the Pacific region, where no federal oil and gas lease sales have been held since 1984. Congressional and presidential leasing moratoria have restricted the region for the past 30 years, with opposition from the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. Members of Congress can influence the development of a five-year program by submitting public comments, holding oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. The 114th Congress utilized these methods to address the proposed program for 2017-2022, and the 115th Congress may also choose to do so. Congress is not required to directly approve the final program under the OCSLA. Other stakeholders, such as state governors, agencies, and the public, can also submit comments on the program. Members of Congress, along with other stakeholders, can influence the proposed 2017-2022 program through public comments, legislation, and oversight hearings. BOEM received comments from Members on the initial request for information, the DPP, and the PP, with varying levels of support or opposition to lease sales and regions included in the program. BOEM considers public comments, including those from Members of Congress, when developing drafts of a five-year oil and gas leasing program. Comments may support or oppose lease sales, suggest expansions of lease areas, or address related issues like seismic testing in the Atlantic. BOEM revises the program based on feedback, with oversight hearings held by the House or Senate to evaluate the proposed program. BOEM considers public comments, including those from Members of Congress, when developing drafts of a five-year oil and gas leasing program. Oversight hearings by the House or Senate evaluate the proposed program, allowing Members to address issues such as lease sales, lease areas, and seismic testing in the Atlantic. In 2015, members and witnesses discussed lease sales in the Atlantic and Arctic, as well as seismic surveying. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the program in 2016, focusing on targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale. Congress can modify the program through legislation, such as adding or removing lease sales. The 114th Congress considered bills that would impact the 2017-2022 program. The 114th Congress considered legislation that would have affected the 2017-2022 program, including bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 which aimed to use an earlier-proposed draft program for oil and gas leasing. These bills would have required the Secretary of the Interior to implement a program for FY2015-FY2020 based on the earlier proposal, with some modifications to the number of lease sales. The bills H.R. 1487 and S. 791 aimed to use an earlier-proposed oil and gas leasing program for FY2015-FY2020, with modifications to the number of lease sales. They directed that 3 lease sales would not be part of the program and required BOEM to conduct a sale in the Atlantic region within a year. The bills also mandated lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest and declared the program approved under NEPA. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 and added lease sales, including for the Chukchi Sea. H.R. 1663 and H.R. 3682 aimed to approve the FY2015-FY2020 program under NEPA without further environmental review. H.R. 1663 would have added lease sales for various regions, including the Chukchi Sea and areas off the coast of Virginia. H.R. 3682 proposed amending the OCSLA to require leasing of at least 50% of available unleased acreage in each program. The bill, H.R. 3682, aimed to approve the final program under NEPA and contained offshore provisions such as state revenue-sharing. It proposed amending the OCSLA to require leasing at least 50% of available unleased acreage in areas with significant oil and gas resources. Additionally, the bill aimed to increase oil and gas production by 2032. The bill, H.R. 4749, aimed to increase offshore oil and gas production by at least 3 million barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. It also included provisions for adding additional areas to leasing programs, finalizing leasing programs for specific timeframes, and conducting lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. Other provisions in the bill addressed revenue sharing with states and the organization of ocean energy agencies within the DOI. The bill, H.R. 4749, aimed to increase offshore oil and gas production by at least 3 million barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. It included provisions for conducting lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California, as well as revenue sharing with states and organization of ocean energy agencies within the DOI. H.R. 4749 also directed the Secretary to conduct a lease sale off of North Carolina within two years of enactment, with subsequent annual lease sales in the following five years. Military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states were also provided for. The bill aimed to increase offshore oil and gas production by 3 million barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. It included provisions for lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California, as well as revenue sharing with states. S. 1276 and S. 2011 proposed amendments to the OCSLA for leasing areas with the largest undiscovered resources, reducing the Eastern Gulf leasing moratorium, and adding lease sales to the 2017-2022 program. Senate hearings were held on S. 1276 and S. 2011, with S. 1278 requiring lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea planning areas. S. 1278 proposed lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea planning areas, requiring revenue sharing with the state of Alaska and extending existing leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas to cover 20 years. S. 1279 aimed to include the South Atlantic planning area in the 2017-2022 program and conduct a lease sale in that area. S. 3203 proposed lease sales in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas for the FY2017-FY2023 program. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on S. 1279 and S. 3203, which proposed lease sales in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas for the FY2017-FY2023 program.
