    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws were enacted to address this disparity in insurance coverage. Mental health parity laws aim to reduce disparities in insurance coverage for mental health services compared to medical or surgical services. Policymakers have developed approaches that may mandate coverage for certain mental illnesses and require parity coverage. Mental health parity laws aim to reduce disparities in insurance coverage by mandating coverage for certain mental illnesses and requiring parity coverage. Approaches to achieving parity can be broadly categorized into three types: full parity approach, minimum mandated benefit approach, and mandated offering parity approach. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services. It also requires insurers to comply with parity requirements when covering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions that mandate coverage for certain plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It contains provisions that mandate coverage for certain plans, without modifying the federal mental health parity requirements themselves. The ACA complements two major federal mental health parity laws, MHPA and MHPAEA, which establish parity in annual and aggregate lifetime limits, treatment limitations, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. Recent data shows that approximately one-third of employers with more than 50 employees have modified their benefits in response to MHPAEA, with some choosing to drop coverage for mental health services while others have eliminated coverage limits or increased utilization management. The MHPAEA has led to changes in employer benefits, with some dropping coverage for mental health services while others have removed limits or increased utilization management. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in certain plans, impacting decisions on coverage retention. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. The MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law, mandating that annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage be no less than those for medical services. It applies to group health plans governed by ERISA, PHSA, and IRC, with a small employer exemption for those with 2-50 employees. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) amends federal laws to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health plans, with exemptions for small employers and cost increases. MHPA was extended annually until 2008 and its sunset provision was repealed by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which expands the scope to include substance use disorders. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders. It requires parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. MHPAEA also amends small employer exemptions and clarifies cost exemption parameters. The MHPAEA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and clarifies small employer exemptions and cost exemption parameters. The federal mental health parity requirements do not apply to the individual market, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP plans, or Medicare. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include specific plan types, mandating coverage of certain mental health services. Medicare is not required to comply with these requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Small employer exemption remains, but the definition of small employer was expanded. Starting in 2014, QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Small employer exemption remains, but the definition of small employer was expanded. QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with federal parity requirements. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also comply with federal parity requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations. The ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The application of federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans is explained in detail. The ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. It creates a coverage mandate for mental health and substance abuse services broadly. Federal mental health parity law requires full parity when benefits are offered. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It requires full parity for benefits offered. QHPs must provide essential health benefits defined by the ACA. QHPs must provide essential health benefits, including mental health and substance abuse services, as defined by the ACA. Coverage for these services is required within the 10 broad categories outlined in the statute, with specific details to be determined through the rulemaking process. The Essential Health Benefits (EHB) required by Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) must cover services within 10 broad categories outlined in the ACA. The scope of covered services is determined through the rulemaking process, with coverage mandated to be provided for services in these categories. Medicaid benchmark plans must offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014, as per ACA Section 2001(c). Additionally, new plans offered by health insurance issuers must comply with the EHB requirements outlined in the ACA. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark plans to offer Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014. New plans in the individual and small group markets must also include coverage of EHB by the same date. While not a comprehensive mandate for mental health services, these provisions create a federal requirement for mental health benefits coverage by many insurers. Some states have parity laws mandating coverage for certain mental health conditions. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by Medicaid benchmark plans and new plans in individual and small group markets. Some states have parity laws requiring coverage for specific mental health conditions. ACA Section 1311(d)(3) allows states to require additional benefits beyond EHB for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), but the state must bear the cost. This includes covering mental health and substance abuse services, which is separate from the provision requirement. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by Medicaid benchmark plans and new plans in individual and small group markets. Some states have parity laws requiring coverage for specific mental health conditions. ACA Section 1311(d)(3) allows states to require additional benefits beyond EHB for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), but the state must bear the cost. This includes covering mental health and substance abuse services, which is separate from the provision requirement. QHPs offered by the Exchanges will be provided through both the small group and individual markets; large group plans may have less of an incentive to participate. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by Medicaid benchmark plans and new plans in individual and small group markets. QHPs offered by the Exchanges will be provided through both the small group and individual markets; large group plans may have less of an incentive to participate. The exemption of small employers from federal mental health parity requirements may impact plans offered through the Exchange. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA had a specific exemption for small employers with 2 to 50 employees, applying to group health plans and not individual market coverage. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends these requirements to the individual market, replacing references to group health plans with language covering both group and individual health insurance coverage. This extension includes states where the small employer definition includes self-employed individuals. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market by replacing references to group health plans with language covering both group and individual health insurance coverage. The small employer exemption under PHSA Section 2726(c)(1) may still apply despite this amendment. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law, as modified by the ACA conforming amendment, now includes employers with 1 employee in states allowing single individuals in small groups. The definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include those with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees, compared to the previous average of 2 employees. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law has been expanded to include employers with 1 to 100 employees, compared to the previous range of 2 to 50 employees. States have the option to use the old definition for plans offered through an Exchange until 2016, which may raise questions regarding coverage for self-employed individuals. States have the option to use the old definition of small employer for plans offered through an Exchange, which may raise questions about compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for individuals seeking coverage on the individual market. Additionally, there is a question about whether small employer QHPs might be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). The ACA does not specify if small employer QHPs are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under Section 1311(j). Medicaid can be offered in traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage. The ACA does not specify if small employer QHPs are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements. Medicaid can be provided through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, including Medicaid managed care plans. Federal law previously required all Medicaid managed care plans to comply with mental health parity requirements, which now also apply to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans under the ACA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, requiring compliance with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. ACA Section 2001 mandates Medicaid plans to comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are considered to meet the parity requirement, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans, not Medicaid managed care plans, may not be required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits under ACA Section 2001(c). It is unclear if these requirements extend to plans offered under traditional Medicaid. The ACA Section 2001(c) raises questions about whether Medicaid plans, other than managed care plans, need to follow federal mental health parity requirements. It also raises concerns about the impact on coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees. The ACA expands the requirement for compliance with certain federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, potentially impacting coverage for mental health and substance abuse services. Existing provisions in the CHIP statute may need to be updated to align with ACA changes. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, potentially impacting coverage for mental health and substance abuse services. Existing provisions in the CHIP statute may need to be updated to align with ACA changes, specifically in cases where a state child health plan provides both mental health or substance abuse disorder benefits and medical and surgical benefits. Compliance with PHSA Section 2705 is required for both financial requirements and treatment limitations. This aligns with ACA Section 2001, extending federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) deems CHIP plans offering EPSDT as satisfying the parity requirement. It is unclear if offering EPSDT services fulfills compliance with the full set of parity requirements at SSA Section 2103(f)(2). The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include all coverage offered under SSA Section 2103, requiring CHIP plans to comply with all federal mental health parity requirements, not just financial requirements and treatment limitations. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include all coverage under SSA Section 2103, extending these requirements to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It also mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, representing a significant change from prior federal law. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include all coverage under SSA Section 2103, extending to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, representing a significant change from prior federal law. The federal mental health parity requirements under the ACA extend to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It is unclear if these requirements apply to non-managed care plans offered under traditional Medicaid. The CHIP statute includes two separate parity provisions, with one having a limited reach and the other applying requirements to CHIP plans entirely."
