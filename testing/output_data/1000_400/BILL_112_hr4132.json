    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". The FDA plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases. Advances in bioinformatics have led to a better understanding of disease mechanisms. New targeted medicines are being developed using biomarkers and predictive toxicology. FDA should implement expedited processes for reviewing innovative medicines for serious or rare diseases. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or rare diseases, using surrogate or clinical endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. This can lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval. Patients benefit from faster access to safe and effective therapies for unmet medical needs. Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases. The existing statutory authority for expedited drug approval should be enhanced to allow FDA to consider appropriate scientific data and expedite access to novel treatments. The FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary can facilitate the development and expedite the review of a new drug designated as a fast track product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and addresses unmet medical needs. The sponsor of the drug can request this designation at any time after submitting an application for investigation under section 505(i) or section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The sponsor of a new drug can request the Secretary to designate it as a fast track product, which will expedite the development and review process. The Secretary will determine if the drug meets the criteria within 60 days of the request and take appropriate actions if it does. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product if it meets certain criteria, expediting the development and review process for approval. The Secretary may also approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease under specific conditions. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product under specific conditions, expediting the approval process for a serious or life-threatening disease. This includes considering the product's effect on surrogate or clinical endpoints that predict clinical benefit or irreversible morbidity/mortality. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product under specific conditions, expediting the approval process for a serious or life-threatening disease. This includes considering the product's effect on surrogate or clinical endpoints that predict clinical benefit or irreversible morbidity/mortality. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to verify the predicted effects. The Secretary may require post-approval studies to verify the predicted effects of a fast track product on clinical benefit or irreversible morbidity/mortality. The sponsor must also submit promotional materials for review before dissemination. The Secretary has the authority to expedite withdrawal of approval for a product approved under these conditions. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a fast track product using expedited procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies diligently or if a study fails to verify predicted clinical benefits. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a fast track product if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently, a study fails to verify predicted benefits, or if the product is found to be unsafe or ineffective under the conditions of use. The Secretary may review incomplete applications for approval of a fast track product if preliminary data suggests effectiveness. The review can start before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays required fees. The Secretary may review incomplete applications for fast track product approval based on preliminary data suggesting effectiveness. Applicants must provide a submission schedule and pay required fees to start the review process before the application is complete. Awareness efforts will be developed and disseminated to relevant parties by the Secretary. The Secretary shall develop and disseminate information on accelerated approval and fast track products to relevant parties. Additionally, a program will be established to encourage the development of scientific methods to predict clinical benefit for serious medical conditions. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment. Regulations governing accelerated approval will be amended to align with the amendments made by section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to issue guidance within one year of the Act's enactment, aligning regulations with amendments made by section 3. Considerations include issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases, as well as incorporating novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints. The guidance to be issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will address incorporating novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence, especially for diseases with low prevalence where collecting other types of data is impractical. The issuance of guidance or conforming regulations will not delay the review or approval of requests or applications under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW.\n\nThe Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with various stakeholders will be included.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
