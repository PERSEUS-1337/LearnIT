    "content": "The Act titled \"Scenic Columbia Gorge Restoration Act of 2017\" allows for expedited recovery activities in response to catastrophic events in national scenic areas. The Act defines \"catastrophic event\" as any natural disaster or fire, flood, or explosion, and \"conclusion\" as including containment of the event. It also defines \"National Scenic Area\" as an area with outstanding natural, scenic, and recreational values. Within 30 days after a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area, the Secretary of Agriculture must propose response activities, such as salvage operations or reforestation, to address the impact of the event. The term \"National Scenic Area\" refers to an area recognized for its natural, scenic, and recreational values within the National Forest System. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the Forest Service, must propose response activities within 30 days of a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area. Public input and objection processes are required before implementing the response activity. The Secretary of Agriculture must propose response activities within 30 days of a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area. An environmental assessment for the response activity should be completed within 60 days after the event, with a categorical exclusion available for certain activities. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires response activities in a National Scenic Area to be completed within 60 days of a catastrophic event. A categorical exclusion is available for activities not exceeding 10,000 acres within the area and meeting specific criteria. The National Scenic Area management plan includes provisions for screening human development, municipal watersheds, and utility right-of-ways. Consultation under the Endangered Species Act is not required if a response activity is deemed not likely to harm listed species or critical habitat. Expedited consultation may be available for certain response activities. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 does not require consultation if a response activity is not likely to harm listed species or critical habitat. Expedited consultation must be completed within 90 days if not covered by the previous provision. The Secretary requested consultation. If not concluded within 90 days, the response activity is not in violation of the Endangered Species Act and can proceed without court orders. (g) Funding Source.--Amounts in the special fund established pursuant to the Knutson-Vandenberg Act shall be available to the Secretary for response activities, including reforestation objectives on National Scenic Area lands impacted by catastrophic events. The Secretary must achieve reforestation of at least 75 percent of the impacted lands within two years after the catastrophic event."
