Nearly 2 million transportation workers have applied for and received a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) at marine facilities and onboard US-flag vessels, as required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Applicants pay $132.50 and make multiple trips to an enrollment center for the TWIC. Nearly two million transportation workers have applied for and received a TWIC, costing $132.50. The card is valid for five years, requiring workers to make multiple trips to an enrollment center for renewal. This process can be burdensome and costly, especially if the center is far from their home. Workers face the burden of making multiple time-consuming trips to a TWIC enrollment center, costing $132.50 for a new card. The process is not mandated by statute but driven by a DHS policy decision to align with standards for Personal Identity Verification. The TWIC issuance aligns with PIV standards for Federal employees and contractors, following FIPS-201. DHS may deviate from the standard if needed. Unlike other credentials, TWIC is a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possessing a TWIC does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. The TWIC, following FIPS-201 standards, serves as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possession of a TWIC does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has the flexibility to develop an alternative enrollment process that does not require multiple trips to an enrollment center. Other secure government-issued identity documents can be distributed by mail. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers to be issued no later than two years after the TWIC pilot began in August 2010, but the rule has not been issued yet. Congress mandated the reform of the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens. The deployment of TWIC readers should be required promptly for security purposes, and funds allocated for TWIC projects should not expire before the issuance of the final TWIC reader rule. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to reform the TWIC application process within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, limiting in-person visits to one except in special circumstances. This was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
