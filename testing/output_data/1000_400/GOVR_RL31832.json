    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. Several pieces of legislation in the 110th Congress addressed penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA, which expired in 1989, is periodically reauthorized and the export licensing system is continued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The EAA is the statutory authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to regulate exports of potentially sensitive commodities, software, computers, and technology. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls exports of dual-use items with civilian and military applications. The regulations are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the Department of Commerce, restricting exports based on item, country, and recipient entity. Some advocate for liberalizing export regulations to enhance American companies' international competitiveness, while others argue for maintaining strict controls for national security reasons. The Export Administration Act of 1979 controls exports of dual-use items with civilian and military applications. Some advocate for liberalizing export regulations to enhance American companies' international competitiveness, while others argue for maintaining strict controls for national security reasons. The report discusses the evolution of the Export Administration Act, its major features, including types of controls, the Commerce Control List, export licensing procedures, and issues concerning the maintenance of export controls under IEEPA. It also highlights controlled commodities featured prominently in export control. The Export Administration Act of 1979 controls exports of dual-use items with civilian and military applications, discussing its evolution, major features, types of controls, Commerce Control List, export licensing procedures, and issues under IEEPA. It also highlights controlled commodities and debates on technology control, multilateral regimes, export control organization, and impact on the U.S. economy. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with a shift towards extensive peacetime regulations after WWII. The Export Control Act of 1949 formalized the need for an extensive peacetime export control system, focusing on the Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply controls to prevent the export of scarce goods, foreign policy controls to promote foreign policy objectives, and national security controls to address security threats. The 1949 Export Control Act established short-supply, foreign policy, and national security controls to prevent the export of scarce goods, promote foreign policy objectives, and address security threats. This included controlling items related to regional stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare. The Export Control Act of 1949 established security controls to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries threatening US national security. CoCom was created as a multilateral counterpart to regulate critical technology transfers among NATO allies. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to regulate critical technology transfers among NATO allies. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times with high restrictions until the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\" in the late 1960s led to a reexamination and revision of the export control system. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the near-embargo characteristic of the Export Control Act of 1949, reflecting a shift towards less restrictive policies. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the strict export controls of the 1949 Export Control Act, reflecting a trend towards liberalization. Subsequent renewals in 1974 and 1977 continued this shift, with a comprehensive rewrite in 1979 forming the basis of the current export control system. Amendments in 1985 and further liberalization followed, influenced by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. The export control system has since been reduced in scope starting from the George H.W. Bush Administration. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 led to further liberalization of the export control system. The export control system has been streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration. Calls for revamping the act have been made to enhance exports, focus on current national security threats, or increase penalties for violations. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and the establishment of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 also significantly changed the export control environment. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment. Congress has struggled to reform the Export Administration Act, with temporary extensions and the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to continue export controls. The Export Administration Act has faced challenges in Congress, with temporary extensions and the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to continue export controls. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the EAA of 1979 until August 20, 2001, addressing concerns about the effectiveness of the export control process. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act of 1979 until August 20, 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in multiple Congresses. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 was introduced but no action was taken. Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor, but action was not taken due to concerns of several Senators. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001. Hearings were held, and the bill was reported favorably for consideration by the Senate. The Senate debated the legislation and passed it with three amendments by a vote of 85-14. The Export Administration Act of 2001 was introduced by Senator Enzi in the 107th Congress. The Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee held hearings and reported the bill favorably. It was debated and passed with three amendments by a vote of 85-14. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman with 35 amendments passed by the House International Relations Committee. The Export Administration Act, H.R. 2581, introduced in 2001 by Representative Benjamin Gilman, was identical to S. 149 with added provisions for oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. The House International Relations Committee passed the legislation with 35 amendments on August 1. The House Armed Services Committee further amended H.R. 2581 on March 6, 2002, and reported it out by a vote of 44-6. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held hearings but did not alter the legislation. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has also been used periodically to attempt to amend the export control regime, with the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) containing provisions related to dual-use export controls. The EAA legislation in the 108th Congress included provisions for dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for certain technologies and items, and exporters to obtain licenses for items previously exported to China. The House version of NDAA 2005 also addressed dual-use export controls. The 1405 provision required exporters to obtain licenses for items previously exported to China, conditional on written assurance not to transfer without consent. Concerns were raised about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China. In the 109th Congress, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced by Representative Henry Hyde in 2005. In the 109th Congress, a bill introduced by Representative Henry Hyde aimed to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. The bill also sought to extend the expired EAA for two years and provide authorization of appropriations for export control activities. However, this bill did not receive consideration in Congress. No comprehensive legislation to rewrite or reauthorize the EAA was introduced in the 110th Congress. The bill aimed to make targeted changes that all sides could support, extending the expired EAA for two years and authorizing appropriations for export control activities. Legislation in the 110th Congress included amendments to enforcement and penalties, integrating export control information into electronic filing, and targeting countries of diversion concern. The 110th Congress considered legislation to improve export control enforcement and target countries of diversion concern, including bills such as H.R. 6828 and S. 3445. Only S. 3445/H.R. 7112 was acted upon, with H.R. 7112 passing in the House. Representative Sherman later introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) in 2009. H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House under suspension of the rules on September 26, 2008. Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) in 2009, which includes provisions on export controls enforcement and diversion control. The legislation grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations. The draft legislation grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations, allowing for investigations, search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce in the United States and overseas. It also authorizes search, detention, and seizures at U.S. ports of entry or exit with the concurrence of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Commerce is directed to publish and update best practices guidelines for effective export control compliance. The bill grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations, allowing for search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce in the United States and overseas. It also authorizes these actions at U.S. ports of entry or exit with the Secretary of Homeland Security's approval. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with publishing and updating best practices guidelines for export control compliance. The bill aims to integrate licensing requirements and data collection rules into the Automated Export System. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to integrate licensing requirements and data collection rules into the Automated Export System to prevent improper shipments and notify filers of export control issues. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs remains a concern for Congress, highlighted by instances of sensitive goods being diverted to unauthorized destinations. The 111th Congress is concerned about evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates where sensitive goods were diverted to Iran for use in Iraq. The Bureau of Industry and Security proposed creating a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern, imposing stricter licensing requirements on products with high diversion risk. H.R. 3515 proposes the creation of a 'Category C' for countries of diversion concern regarding exports to Iran. The bill requires the President to identify countries at risk of transhipment, reexportation, or diversion of items subject to export controls within 180 days. Countries could be designated as either possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns, triggering government-to-government contacts to strengthen their export controls. The bill proposes creating a 'Category C' for countries at risk of transhipment, reexportation, or diversion of items subject to export controls to Iran. Countries could be designated as possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns, with government-to-government contacts to strengthen their export controls. Countries directly involved in such activities would be listed as countries of diversion concern, subject to additional licensing requirements and more stringent reviews. The government's direct involvement in transhipments, reexportations, or diversions would lead to a country being listed as a diversion concern. This would result in additional licensing requirements, stricter reviews, and increased end-user checks. The legislation also includes a provision for an annual report on transfers of dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries. President Obama initiated a review of the export control system in 2009, with Defense Secretary Gates outlining key reform elements in 2010. The U.S. export control system is under review by the National Security Council and the National Economic Council. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the system, including creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, implementing a single integrated IT system, and establishing a single enforcement coordination agency. These changes would be implemented in three phases. The administration's blueprint aims to reform the U.S. export control system by creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, implementing an integrated IT system, and establishing an enforcement coordination agency in three phases. Phase I involves harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List and developing standardized licensing processes. Phase II will implement a harmonized licensing system. Phase II of the U.S. export control system reform involves creating a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured control lists. This harmonization aims to significantly reduce license requirements and may involve moving items from the munitions list to the dual-use list. Consultations with multilateral control regimes partners will also take place to adjust controls on certain items. The Phase III of the U.S. export control system reform includes establishing a single licensing agency, merging control lists, consolidating enforcement activities, and implementing a new IT system. Secretary Gates predicts the 3-phase plan will unfold over the next year, but leaves many questions unanswered. The Phase III of the U.S. export control system reform includes establishing a single licensing agency, merging control lists, and implementing a new IT system. Secretary Gates predicts the plan will unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered. Legislative action may be required for some proposals, and changes to the control lists would entail multilateral consultations. Changes to the structure of the control lists in Phase II of the U.S. export control system reform may require multilateral consultations. The placement of the proposed licensing agency within existing departments or as an independent entity is still undecided. Common principles in the legislation include types of export controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. The EAA and efforts to renew it have common principles for export controls, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. U.S. dual-use export controls restrict items based on national security, foreign policy, or domestic economy impact. Items on the Commerce Control List are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons. The Commerce Control List (CCL) and Export Administration Regulations control items for national security and foreign policy reasons. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries. National security control items require licenses reviewed case-by-case for approval. The National Security licensing requirement of the EAR controls items for national security purposes, reviewed case-by-case for approval. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) to identify goods and technology for control. The list of controlled countries is Country Group D-1, and licenses are approved if items are not for military use. The control list is periodically reviewed and revised by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Defense and other agencies identify items for national security control. The Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) is maintained for this purpose. National security controls do not cover items under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes. Items controlled for national security are subject to a foreign availability determination. The Secretary of Defense and other agencies identify items for national security control, excluding nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation items. Items subject to national security controls require a foreign availability determination to assess if they are readily available from sources outside the United States. If an item is deemed to have foreign availability, it must be decontrolled, unless the President decides otherwise. The Export Administration Act (EAA) allows for foreign availability determinations to decontrol items subject to national security control. The President can overturn the decontrol decision if it is deemed detrimental to national security, leading to negotiations with multilateral control partners. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, was responsible for gathering data and reporting to Congress on assessing foreign availability. The bill created an Office of Foreign Availability to gather data for determinations and report to Congress. This office no longer exists, with the Office of Technology Evaluation now handling foreign availability assessments. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee was established to involve university experts in determining technologies for control lists, particularly for deemed exports. BIS conducted a review of the Commerce Control List to protect technologies for national security reasons. The BIS plays a key role in determining technologies for the control list, focusing on deemed exports and national security. In 2007-8, a systemic review of the CCL was conducted, with plans for a three-year review cycle. In 2009, certain licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras were lifted for 36 U.S. allied countries, decontrolling low to mid-market night vision cameras. Export controls were tightened on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. The BIS decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities, tightened export controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras, and requires exporters to report transactions on a semi-annual basis. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues, with industry sources noting delays in BIS engagement and interagency agreements. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress. It defines mass market status as applying to items produced or made available in large volume or to multiple buyers, considering distribution, shipping, and intended use without modification. Delays in BIS engagement and interagency agreements have been a concern in resolving issues. The EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress proposed the concept of mass market status for items produced or made available in large volume. This status considers distribution, shipping, and intended use without modification. The legislation was controversial due to concerns over wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, terrorism deterrence, and compliance with international obligations. Foreign policy controls are in place for various purposes such as anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, and non-proliferation. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, deterring terrorism, and complying with international obligations. Foreign policy controls are in place for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, United Nations sanctions, unilateral embargoes, and non-proliferation objectives, including chemical and biological weapons, nuclear proliferation, and missile technology. The EAA attaches limitations on the use of foreign policy controls, requiring yearly renewal, clear objectives and criteria reporting to Congress, negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items, and imposition by the President. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, deterring terrorism, and complying with international obligations. Foreign policy controls must be renewed yearly and require clear objectives and criteria reporting to Congress. The President is directed to engage in negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items and impose controls to comply with international obligations or treaties. Additionally, a license is required for exporting certain items to countries supporting international terrorism. Controls are not authorized for sales of medicine, medical supplies, food donations, seeds, and water resource equipment for basic human needs, or if they would cause malnutrition or hardship. Controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines have been further amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Controls on sales of medicine, medical supplies, food donations, seeds, and water resource equipment for basic human needs are not authorized. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 further amended controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines. Catch-all controls require a license for export or reexport of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of 1991, contained in Part 744 of the EAR, requires a license for export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities subject to EPCI. Regulations include a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel, as well as foreign terrorist organizations. The 1979 EAA authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflation. Short-supply controls remain for crude oil and petroleum derivatives. The 1979 EAA authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflation. Short-supply controls remain for crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and the export of horses by sea. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing applications with a total value of approximately $72.1 billion in FY2008. Dual-use technology licenses represented 1.7% of total U.S. exports in FY2008. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion. This included $50.2 billion in crude oil exports for refined petroleum. Dual-use technology licenses accounted for $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports. 84% of applications were approved, 1.0% denied, and 15% returned. China received the most licenses with a value of $2.7 billion. The Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed 21,213 license applications in FY2008 totaling $72.1 billion, including $50.2 billion in crude oil exports. China was the largest destination for controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the most approved license applications with 2,212 applications valued at $294 million. The Commerce Control List (CCL) includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. The Commerce Control List (CCL) is a list of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. It consists of ten categories, each further divided into functional groups, including nuclear materials, electronics, telecommunications, and propulsion systems. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items into specific groups such as electronics, computers, telecommunications, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics, marine, and propulsion systems. Each category is further divided into equipment, assemblies, components, test equipment, materials, software, and technology. Each item on the CCL is assigned an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) with a description and reason for control. There are approximately 500 ECCN listings, and all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Nearly all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the EAR, allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, but some products may still require a license due to high diversion risk or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition. The commodity jurisdiction (CJ) process determines if a product is considered dual-use or a munition, which dictates the regulatory regime that will apply. Exporters may request a classification from BIS for items not listed on the CCL, aiming for a less restrictive classification under the EAR. Some exporters seek BIS commodity classification for dual-use goods. BIS refers requests to State and Defense, but GAO criticized low referral numbers and lack of criteria. Only 10 out of 5,370 requests in 2005 were referred. The General Accounting Office (GAO) criticized the low number of classifications referred to State and Defense by BIS in 2005. Despite recommendations, jurisdictional disputes and coordination problems between the two departments have not been resolved, leading to exporters determining restrictions. The EAA and EAR establish procedures for license application review and interagency dispute resolution. Executive Order 12981 grants the Secretary of Commerce the authority to review and decide on export licenses, while State, Defense, and Energy Departments also have review powers. Disagreements and coordination issues between departments remain unresolved, allowing exporters to determine restrictions. Procedures for export license review and interagency dispute resolution were established by Executive Order 12981. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and decide on licenses, with other agencies also having review powers. Within nine days of application registration, the Secretary must seek additional information, refer the application to other agencies, assure correct security classification, grant or deny the application. The Secretary of Commerce reviews export license applications, seeking additional information and referring them to other agencies if necessary. The reviewing agency must provide a recommendation within 30 days, with regulatory justification for denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days implies no objection to the Secretary's decision. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) is a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism created in 1995. It consists of the Secretary of Commerce, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Board provides recommendations on export license applications and may invite other agency heads to participate as needed. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) was created by Executive Order in 1970 and consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence are non-voting members. The Board may invite other agency heads to participate. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and includes the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration as Chair. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP is made up of representatives from relevant departments. Dispute resolution starts with the OC, with the Chair making decisions within 14 days. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP, chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, is the third tier of the EARB. The Chair, selected by the Secretary of Commerce, reviews recommendations from departments and informs them of decisions within 14 days. Dispute resolution begins with the OC, and appeals can be made to the ACEP within five days. The ACEP members vote on applications within 11 days of an appeal. Department heads of dissenting agencies can appeal to the Secretary within five days, and the EARB must decide by majority vote within 11 days. The appeal process within the EARB involves reviewing recommendations and voting on applications within specific timeframes. Department heads can appeal decisions to higher authorities, with a final appeal option to the President. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days, but there is no set timeframe for Presidential consideration of a license decision. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by specific reasons and modifications for reconsideration. The Order does not specify a time frame for Presidential consideration of a license decision. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by specific reasons for denial, with an appeal procedure outlined in the EAR. Appeals can be based on foreign availability, and in some cases, a denial may be reversed. In FY2008, 422 cases were escalated to the OC, with 20 examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority. In FY2008, BIS reported 422 cases escalated to the OC and 20 examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority under IEEPA. Controls were later terminated during temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994, with President Clinton reimposing controls under IEEPA in 1994. President Clinton reimposed controls under IEEPA in 1994 after temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994. President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority have been noted, including the lapse of police power for enforcement agents. In 2001, President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls under IEEPA. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority include the need for enforcement agents to obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status, lack of jurisdiction limitation for federal courts, absence of a confidentiality provision for export license applications, and no explicit authorization to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) lacks provisions for confidentiality and discouraging compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that the U.S. sends the wrong message by not enacting appropriate legislation, diminishing credibility in urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. Penalty authorities under IEEPA are lower than under the Export Administration Act (EAA), reducing their deterrent effect. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) lacks provisions for confidentiality and discouraging compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that U.S. credibility is diminished by the lack of appropriate legislation, reducing the deterrent effect of penalty authorities. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96) raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons, and civil penalties to $250,000. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised penalties for violations involving national security controls to $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals, and $1 million or 5 times the value of exports for firms. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional attention has focused on technologically advanced computers. Technologically advanced computers, including HPCs, are a focus of congressional attention. HPCs can perform complex digital operations quickly and include various technologies like supercomputers, workstations, and advanced microprocessors. Performance is measured in MTOPS, with actual performance varying based on the operations performed. The benchmark for HPC computing performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) was approved in 2005. This new standard is measured in weighted teraflops (WT) and controls high-end proprietary HPCs. The new standard for HPC computing performance, called adjusted peak performance (APP), is measured in weighted teraflops (WT) and sets the control level at 0.75 WT. This level replaces the previous benchmark of 190,000 MTOPS from January 2002. The level for computer software and technology is 0.04 WT, and for computer development and production technology is 0.1 WT. There have been restrictions on U.S. exports of HPC technology, but advocates argue that advancements in computing capabilities warrant a reevaluation. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, HPC export thresholds were raised multiple times, with the last change in January 2002 setting the threshold for exports to Tier 3 countries at 190,000 MTOPS. This decontrol process significantly impacted BIS regulations. The MTOPS level for HPC exports was last changed in January 2002 by the Bush Administration, raising the threshold to 190,000 MTOPS for Tier 3 countries. This decontrol process had a significant regulatory impact on BIS, reducing the number of license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. It also imposed post-shipment verification requirements and the need to notify Congress of any adjustments in the MTOPS threshold levels. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages for secure data transfer. The Export Administration Act in the 107th Congress imposed special conditions on high performance computer exports, including post-shipment verification and notification requirements to Congress. Encryption is crucial for secure data transfer and has civilian and military implications. Control authority over encryption technology was transferred from State to Commerce in 1996, leading to decontrols of encryption items and technology. The transfer of control authority of encryption technology from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996 led to decontrols of encryption items and technology. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users in other countries with a license exemption. Stealth technology is used to protect systems against electronic detection. Stealth technology involves materials and designs to protect against electronic detection. It can deflect or absorb radar signals to prevent detection. Export controls are in place due to civil applications and the need to maintain U.S. leadership in this technology. Stealth technology materials prevent radar reflection back to the receiver, with export controls in place to maintain U.S. leadership. Concerns over potential exports led to reclassification of certain technology as munitions in the 1990s. Congress debated controlling exports of commercial satellites and effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations. In 1998, U.S. satellite manufacturers were found to have improperly transferred missile design information to China. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce from late 1996 to March 1999. In 1998, the Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information to China through improper transfer. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce from late 1996 to March 1999. Congress returned export licensing authority to the Department of State in March 1999, causing delays and lost sales for the satellite industry. They have lobbied to reverse export controls to Commerce. Commercial communication satellites may contain sensitive technology like positioning thrusters and signal encryption. The transfer of commercial satellite technology from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List has caused licensing delays and lost sales due to regulatory uncertainty. Manufacturers have lobbied to reverse export controls to the Department of Commerce. This transfer includes sensitive technology like positioning thrusters, signal encryption, and manufacturing equipment used for missiles and aircraft engines. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 allows for the transfer of commercial satellite components with congressional approval. The President may transfer commercial satellite technology from the USML to the CCL with congressional approval. This includes advanced manufacturing equipment for missiles and aircraft engines. The industry has concerns about competition and lack of controls, especially regarding China. The BIS recommended decontrolling certain products to China and Taiwan. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation recommended decontrolling certain products to China and Taiwan, including 5-axis simultaneously controlled machine tools. Concerns were raised about the decontrol of \"hot section\" technology used in jet aircraft development and production during debates in the 106th Congress. The Department of Commerce regulates technology incorporated in commercial aircraft, separate from foreign policy-based control. Concerns were raised in the 106th Congress about decontrolling \"hot section\" technology in jet aircraft development. The civilian aviation industry is worried about the DDTC asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts. EAA Section 17(c) addresses exporting standard FAA-certified equipment in civil aircraft to non-controlled countries. The DDTC has been asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components, causing commercial suppliers to submit commodity jurisdiction for items covered by EAA Section 17(c) to avoid ITAR issues. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) in response to this issue. DDTC asserted jurisdiction over a non-FAA component of a CSIS under Commerce, leading commercial suppliers to submit commodity jurisdiction for items covered by EAA Section 17(c) to avoid ITAR issues. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) to clarify that civil aircraft parts eligible for FAA export approval are only subject to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying the interpretation of EAA Section 17(c), stating that Commerce will have jurisdiction over standard civil aircraft parts covered by FAA type certificates. Under the EAA, Commerce will have jurisdiction over standard civil aircraft parts covered by FAA type certificates, clarifying the interpretation of Section 17(c). Suppliers no longer need to submit these parts for a commodity jurisdiction determination. Technology transfers to foreign nationals within the US are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, requiring a license from a US entity. Exports of technology, know-how, and non-encryption source code to foreign nationals within the United States are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations. A license is required if the same transfer to the foreign national's home country would need a license. Deemed exports, not mentioned in the 1979 EAA, have become a significant part of BIS activity, with a large number of deemed export licenses reviewed for Chinese nationals. The 110th Congress aimed to define deemed exports under the Export Administration Regulations. BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses in FY2007, with 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established new rules in response to an IG report recommending changes in the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls. The IG suggested using country of birth instead of citizenship or residency for determining export control requirements. The IG recommended using country of birth as the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls, instead of citizenship or residency. Deemed export controls will continue to be based on country of citizenship or permanent residency, not place of birth. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended establishing a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline the deemed export application process based on an evaluation of an applicant's probable loyalties. This includes considering country of birth, prior residence, current citizenship, and past activities. The Commission also suggested simplifying certain terminology in the regulations and establishing an outside panel of experts for an annual review of technologies on the Commerce Control List. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended evaluating applicants' probable loyalties through factors like birth country, prior residence, and current citizenship for a streamlined application process. Industry and research communities criticized the proposals as unmanageable. The Bureau of Industry and Security sought feedback on technologies subject to deemed export controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) sought feedback on technologies subject to deemed export controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in debates on export administration legislation. Many support reform of the current export control system to assist U.S. business. Many support reform of the current export control system to assist U.S. business while others prioritize national security concerns, focusing on effective controls for potential exports to countries threatening the United States. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, and the licensing process structure. The debate over the reauthorization of the Export Administration Act (EAA) revolves around the effectiveness of export controls on technology, multilateral regimes, bureaucratic licensing processes, and their impact on the U.S. economy. Industry groups support provisions in potential EAA legislation that focus on foreign availability and mass market concepts, arguing that technology flow cannot be effectively controlled. Industry groups supporting potential EAA legislation argue that foreign availability and mass market concepts are key benefits, claiming that U.S. dominance of cutting-edge technology is no longer guaranteed. They believe unilateral controls are ineffective and only harm American businesses, while foreign businesses gain new markets or incentives to enter them. The current export control system is seen as ineffective by industry groups supporting potential EAA legislation. They argue that U.S. dominance of technology is no longer guaranteed and that unilateral controls harm American businesses while foreign businesses benefit. Globalization has made unilateral export controls unworkable as component parts are manufactured worldwide and can be obtained from other sources. Component parts in many industries are manufactured globally and considered commodities. Daimler Chrysler Aerospace is reducing reliance on American components due to licensing delays. Critics argue that the mass market standard could undermine U.S. export controls by decontrolling items used for proliferation. Non-proliferation advocates express concerns about the potential loopholes in the export control regime. Critics argue that the mass market standard could nullify U.S. export controls by decontrolling items used for proliferation, allowing virtually any product to qualify. Industry proponents claim that robust export industries enhance national security. The argument for robust export industries enhancing national security is based on the shift in defense procurement towards commercial applications. Industry believes that selling current technology is crucial for funding future technology development. If American firms face competitive disadvantages due to export controls, foreign firms could surpass the U.S. in technological advancements, potentially impacting national security technology quality. Industry argues for a streamlined export process to fund future technology development and prevent foreign firms from surpassing the U.S. in technological advancements. Critics argue that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could compromise national security, citing the example of Iraq receiving U.S. weaponry in the past. The United States should not sell advanced technology to potentially hostile states as it could be used against the US or its allies in the future. This reliance on the civilian sector for R&D is a result of declining defense budgets in the 1990s. Some argue that R&D for defense capabilities should be funded within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. Some argue that R&D for defense capabilities should be funded within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. Industry groups and observers highlight the rapid rise in computing power as a challenge for export control systems. Attempting to control computing power is seen as unfeasible and self-defeating, as it can lead to market loss and hinder R&D opportunities. The distinction between super-computers and commodity computers has blurred due to increasing computing speeds and networking advances. Microprocessors can be linked to create servers with capabilities that breach export thresholds. The increasing computing power challenges export control systems as microprocessors can be linked to create servers with capabilities that breach export thresholds. The ability to cluster commodity computers erodes restrictions on high-performance computing, making it difficult to control access to advanced technology. Some believe limiting exports of American-made computers can restrict access to the highest computer technology. The ability to cluster commodity computers erodes restrictions on high-performance computing, making it difficult to control access to advanced technology. Some believe limiting exports of American-made computers can restrict access to the highest computer technology by maintaining qualitative differences and superior networking and service. The post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98 aims to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods, especially for computers destined for tier III destinations like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about exports of HPCs to China, where access to U.S. HPC exports is restricted. The GAO has reported concerns about exports of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) to China, where access is restricted. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has made limited efforts to monitor compliance with export licenses. Difficulty in monitoring is exacerbated by close ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military. The United States participates in the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions for export control. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes, including the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions. This regime, established in 1996, is related to dual-use goods and technology and has a control list similar to the U.S. CCL items. Additionally, the U.S. is involved in other proliferation-related control regimes such as the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which have common control lists and reporting requirements. The United States participates in multiple proliferation-related control regimes, including the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These groups operate based on national discretion, common control lists, and regular reporting requirements. Member nations control exports under their own laws, with a focus on disclosure of licensing decisions and consultation on sensitive exports. Some groups have a \"no undercut\" provision to prevent licensing conflicts, but decisions are made by consensus and are limited in scope. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other proliferation-related control regimes rely on national discretion, common control lists, and regular reporting. Some groups have a \"no undercut\" provision to prevent conflicts, but operate by consensus and have limited institutional structures. Critics argue that the reliance on consensus hampers effectiveness, as minimal reporting requirements hinder pre-export consultation among member states. Industry representatives emphasize the need for effective multilateral controls to ensure adherence by all capable states. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other control regimes rely on national discretion and common control lists. Industry representatives stress the importance of effective multilateral controls for technology exports. They criticize the unilateral nature of export policies, especially regarding exports to China. Domestic controls combined with minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies. The lack of consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries on technology transfer limits to China is criticized for damaging American companies. Industry spokesmen fault the U.S. for strict licensing policies towards China without convincing allies to follow suit. Proponents of tighter export restrictions argue that the U.S. must lead to strengthen the Wassenaar Arrangement and non-proliferation efforts. The United States must lead in strengthening export controls and non-proliferation efforts, as consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries is lacking on technology transfer limits to China. Industry spokesmen criticize the U.S. for strict licensing policies towards China without convincing allies to follow suit. Adherents argue that a successful negotiating strategy is to adopt controls first and persuade other countries to follow suit, rather than relying solely on consensus-based policies. Both industry spokesmen and advocates agree on the need to strengthen multilateral controls, but consensus on which goods and countries pose a threat is required. The strategy of relying solely on consensus-based policies for export controls is deemed ineffective and harmful to national security. There is a need to strengthen multilateral controls, but consensus on which goods and countries pose a threat is essential. The dilemma arises when there is a lack of agreement on target countries, such as China, leading to the question of whether the United States should impose controls unilaterally. This decision hinges on weighing non-proliferation or foreign policy goals against potential economic costs and risks to American businesses and jobs. The debate over U.S. export control policy towards China revolves around balancing economic benefits with national security concerns. Some argue that current controls are too stringent and hinder technology transfers to China, while others emphasize the need to minimize the risk of exporting sensitive technologies to China. Some argue that U.S. export control policy towards China is too strict, hindering technology transfers and causing delays in sales. This has led to Chinese companies not seeking bids from U.S. firms. However, concerns remain about China's acquisition of dual-use technologies. The U.S. export control policy towards China is a topic of debate. While some argue that it is too strict and hinders technology transfers, others express concerns about China's acquisition of dual-use technologies. China has been implicated in various proliferation activities, leading to calls for tightened controls and greater enforcement of export controls. The final rule published by BIS on June 19, 2007, titled \"Revisions and Clarification of Export and Re-export Controls for the People's Republic of China,\" includes new licensing requirements for certain products for military end-use, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for an end-user statement for licensed products. Concerns have been raised about the export of commercial technology to certain end-users undermining the arms embargo against China. Industry and others have questioned the scope and effectiveness of these new controls. The proposed rule by BIS aims to address concerns about the export of commercial technology to certain end-users undermining the arms embargo against China. It includes new military end-use controls and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items destined for China. The new rule establishes controls on 20 product categories, requiring a license for exports to China. The new rule by BIS introduces military end-use controls on 20 product categories for exports to China, requiring a license if the items are intended for military purposes in the PRC. It also revises the licensing policy for items that could enhance China's military capabilities in key weapons systems. The new rule by BIS introduces military end-use controls on 20 product categories for exports to China, requiring a license if the items are intended for military purposes in the PRC. It clarifies a presumption of denial for license applications to export items that would contribute to China's military capabilities in key weapons systems. Additionally, the rule increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of the PRC. The new rule by BIS introduces military end-use controls on exports to China, requiring a license for items intended for military purposes. It increases the exemption threshold for End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods to China, but expands the requirement to cover all license applications reaching this threshold. The VEU component allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. The VEU component of the China Rule establishes a process for trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. Approval criteria include exclusive engagement in civilian end-use activities, compliance with U.S. export controls, recordkeeping capability, on-site reviews, and relationships with U.S. and foreign companies. MoFCom requires authorization for companies seeking VEU status. The VEU authorization process requires approval from MoFCom for plant or records inspections, with certain items on the CCL not eligible for export. Approved VEUs can import items from any exporter, not just the nominee, and the list of exportable items can be adjusted by the ERC. The VEU program allows approved companies to import items from any exporter, with the list of exportable items determined by the ERC. This streamlines licensing for certain companies and frees up resources for more complex applications. General Electric India was the first eligible company under the expanded VEU program in India. On October 19, 2007, BIS expanded the VEU program to India, with General Electric India being the first eligible company. The first five VEU companies included Applied Materials China, National Semiconductor, Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture, SMIC, and HHNEC, importing goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. AVIC I and HHNEC were flagged for diversion risks due to their affiliations with Chinese military-related entities. In January 2008, the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control raised concerns about AVIC I and HHNEC, stating they pose diversion risks due to their affiliations with Chinese military-related entities. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended the companies, citing their history of using U.S. technology. Controversy surrounding the VEU program with China continued, with a GAO study in September 2008 recommending its suspension. The controversy surrounding the VEU program with China persists, with a GAO study recommending its suspension due to the lack of a specific inspection agreement with China. The BIS has not developed criteria for selecting candidates for on-site reviews or procedures for conducting the reviews. Commerce has conducted checks under a pre-existing verification understanding, but these checks require an end-use statement from MoFCom, contradicting the program's trade facilitation rationale. The VEU program with China faces controversy as the lack of a specific inspection agreement with China has led to recommendations for its suspension by the GAO. Commerce has conducted checks under a pre-existing verification understanding, but these checks require an end-use statement from MoFCom, hindering the program's trade facilitation rationale. Additionally, concerns have been raised about VEU approved entities having connections to state-owned firms sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Representative Markey raised concerns about VEU approved entity Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input on license applications. The Defense Technology Security Agency conducts national security reviews for license applications referred from Commerce and State, while the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) consults with other national security agencies on license applications and commodity classifications. The Department of Defense's Defense Technology Security Agency conducts national security reviews for license applications referred from Commerce and State. The Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses exportation of nuclear materials. The State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders highlight issues with overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments for dual-use products. The U.S. Munitions List controlled by DDTC regulates the export of weapons and military technology. Industry leaders criticize the licensing system for overlapping jurisdiction, lengthy approval times, lack of technological updates, and absence of judicial review. Foreign availability and economic impact are seen as secondary to national security by some. Some analysts question the role of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the export control regime, citing concerns about national security and the lack of judicial review in licensing decisions. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough reviews, checking proposed items against controlled lists and coordinating with government agencies to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Time is needed for these processes, including the ability to pause for additional information on a case-by-case basis. Some analysts question the role of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the export control regime, citing concerns about national security and the lack of judicial review in licensing decisions. They argue that the Department of Commerce's mission of promoting exports may create bias towards granting export licenses over national security goals. However, others point to the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense to argue against such bias."
