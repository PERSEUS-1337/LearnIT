Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended to state that within five years of final map approval for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose new conditions for building permits that were not part of the original approval process. The amended Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits on residential subdivisions within five years of final map approval. However, they are not restricted from taking certain actions. The amended Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits on residential subdivisions within five years of final map approval. However, they can impose conditions or requirements for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. The amended Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits on residential subdivisions within five years of final map approval. However, they can impose conditions for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. This section also applies to cities or city and counties incorporating after January 1, 1985, and includes areas from a tentative or parcel map. The incorporation must adhere to conditions that could have been imposed by the county if there was no incorporation. When incorporating areas from a tentative or parcel map, the city must adhere to conditions that could have been imposed by the county if there was no incorporation. For extended tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps, the five-year period described in the Government Code is reduced to three years. For extended tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps, the five-year period described in the Government Code is reduced to three years. Additionally, cities, counties, or city and counties can still levy fees or impose conditions related to building permits, including fees not included in zoning ordinances. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code extends the expiration date of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps within specific counties by 24 months if approved between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps in certain counties if found consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. The legislative body or advisory agency may deny or conditionally approve an extension for a period of 24 months if the map is not consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. An approved tentative map can be automatically extended for 60 days or until the extension application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If the extension is denied by the advisory agency, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, the conditions for applying this section include annual mean household income below 80% of the statewide income and an unemployment rate at least 2.75% higher than the statewide rate. The community revitalization plan eligibility criteria include a nonseasonal unemployment rate at least 2.75% higher than the statewide rate and a poverty rate at least 4% higher than the statewide median. The extension provided is in addition to other expiration date extensions. The extension provided by subdivisions (a) and (b) is in addition to any extension of the expiration date provided for in certain sections. Any approval by a state agency related to a development project included in an extended map shall be extended by 24 months. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act, and it is deemed an urgency statute for public safety. This act is deemed urgent for public safety to allow cities and counties to extend development applications affected by economic conditions in the construction industry."
