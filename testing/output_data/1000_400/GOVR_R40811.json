    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Federal agencies already have broad authority for fuel reduction efforts, funded through annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments. The existing authorities for federal agencies to reduce biomass fuel for wildfire protection are broad, though indirect. Congress enacts annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments and other management activities that encompass fuel reduction efforts. However, insufficient reporting on funding and accomplishments hinders Congress from assessing progress in reducing biomass fuels. More detailed information on funding and results from thinning and prescribed burning activities is needed to compare benefits and costs effectively. Improved reporting on funding and results for wildfire protection activities is necessary for Congress to assess progress and allocate funding effectively. Thinning, prescribed burning, and other fuel reduction efforts need to be distinguished by ecosystem or fire regime to better understand their benefits and costs. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignitions, making all biomass potential fuel for fires. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignitions, making all biomass potential fuel for fires. Wildfires can be low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires, depending on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. The behavior of wildfires, whether they become surface fires or crown fires, depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts aim to modify fuel properties to mitigate damages from crown fires. Four key characteristics of biomass fuels that influence wildfire behavior are moisture content, fuel size, fuel distribution, and fuel quantity. Moisture content is crucial as it requires heat to evaporate before biomass can burn, with green foliage moisture levels varying based on recent weather conditions. The moisture content of fuels is a key factor in controlling flammability. Green foliage has varying moisture levels depending on recent weather conditions. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, while 100% moisture content can still burn in high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized by the time it takes for moisture levels to decrease by two-thirds. Fine fuels like needles and grass have a 1-hour time lag. Fine fuels like needles, leaves, and grass dry out quickly and are important for spreading fires due to their ability to ignite and burn rapidly. Larger fuels with longer time lag periods, such as woody twigs and branches, contribute less to fire intensity and damage. The different size classes of fuels, ranging from fine fuels like needles to larger 1,000-hour time lag fuels, play varying roles in spreading fires. Fine fuels ignite and burn quickly, while larger fuels burn intensely and contribute significantly to fire damage. Additionally, 10-hour time lag fuels can also spread fires rapidly, especially when carried by winds as firebrands. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in fire behavior, with compactness and arrangement of fuels being key factors. Fine fuels burn quickly and can be carried aloft by winds as firebrands, starting spot fires. Larger fuels, like 1,000-hour time lag fuels, burn intensely and cause significant damage but do not contribute much to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution is crucial for fire behavior, with compactness and continuity of fuels being key factors. Compact fuel beds resist burning due to reduced ventilation, while continuous fuels allow fires to spread. Firelines are used to break the continuity of fuels and control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed determine the width of the break needed. The width of firebreaks needed to control wildfires depends on factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed. Steep slopes and high winds can make fuels more flammable by reducing moisture content and carrying firebrands. Vertical continuity, especially fuel ladders, can spread fires into the canopy, turning surface fires into crown fires. Fuel ladders play a crucial role in spreading fires into the canopy, turning surface fires into crown fires. Wind is essential for initiating and sustaining crown fires, which can increase in intensity and spread rapidly. Fuel loads vary widely and typically exclude biomass in live, commercially valuable trees. The quantity of biomass fuels, known as fuel loads, varies widely and includes dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to more than 200 tons per acre, excluding live crown biomass in commercially valuable trees. The density and continuity of live crown biomass play a significant role in sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire, with smaller fuels being mostly consumed compared to larger fuels. High intensity fires can consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only 10% of tree branches and 5% of large tree stems, leaving many large-diameter fuels on the site. In wildfires, smaller fuels are largely consumed compared to larger fuels. High intensity fires can consume 100% of foliage and 75% of understory vegetation, but only 10% of tree branches and 5% of large tree stems. The nature of fuel characteristics and resulting fires are influenced by different ecosystems, some adapted to low-intensity surface fires, others to high-intensity crown fires, and some to a mixed regime. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to relatively frequent wildfires. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to frequent wildfires, with some dominated by fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine. These ecosystems have open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs, reducing fuel ladders for crown fires. Surface-fire ecosystems in the U.S. have open spaces with fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine. These ecosystems account for about 34% of wildlands and historically had fuels of grasses, needles, and shrubs. Grazing and logging practices have altered fuel loads, leading to changes in the dominance of tree species. Grazing and logging in the late 1800s altered fuel loads in surface-fire ecosystems in the West, leading to an increase in fuel ladders and higher fuel loads than historically natural. Effective fire suppression further exacerbated the situation, increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities that reduce fuel loads have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in these ecosystems. Many surface fire ecosystems have fuel loads higher than historically natural, increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders can decrease wildfire severity. Ecosystems adapted to high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels and frequent fires. An example is chaparral, a xeric ecosystem dominated by large shrubs and small trees. Crown fires can occur in ecosystems like chaparral and lodgepole pine, with varying frequencies. Chaparral is a dense, xeric ecosystem dominated by large shrubs and small trees, while lodgepole pine grows in dense, even-aged stands and relies on serotinous cones that open after being heated by fire. These ecosystems make up about 42% of wildlands in the United States. Crown-fire ecosystems, such as lodgepole pine, make up 42% of US wildlands. Human activities like grazing and fire suppression have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatments are ineffective in preventing catastrophic crown fires, as seen in southern California chaparral. Activities to reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders may not effectively prevent catastrophic crown fires in ecosystems like southern California chaparral. Wildfires in crown-fire ecosystems are patchy, leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned. For example, during the Yellowstone fires in 1988, 30% of the reported burned area was actually unburned, and another 15%-20% had only low-intensity surface fires. The Yellowstone fires in 1988, largely in lodgepole pine, exemplified patchy fires in crown-fire ecosystems. Approximately 30% of the reported burned area remained unburned, while 15%-20% experienced low-intensity surface fires. Only about half of the reported acres burned severely. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, like whitebark pine, have a combination of crown fires and low-intensity surface fires due to an array of fuel sizes and discontinuous crown canopies. Whitebark pine ecosystems are mixed-fire-regime types with a variety of fuel sizes, allowing for both crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. The slow-growing whitebark pines are able to regenerate after sporadic mixed-intensity fires, with Clark's nutcrackers playing a key role in spreading seeds for regeneration in burned areas. Whitebark pine ecosystems are mixed-fire-regime types with various fuel sizes, allowing for both crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. Clark's nutcrackers help spread seeds for regeneration in burned areas, ensuring the survival of pines. Other species in mixed-fire ecosystems include Ponderosa pine and Lodgepole pine, each adapting to different moisture levels. The consequences of fuel reduction activities in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems are not well understood, despite covering 24% of U.S. wildlands. Lodgepole pine in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems in the northern Rockies accounts for about 24% of U.S. wildlands. The consequences of fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems are unclear, including whether abnormal levels of crown fires may occur. It is uncertain if fuel reduction would significantly alter wildfire extent or severity in these areas. Many suggest reducing fuel loads to suppress wildfires and reduce crown fire risk, but the effectiveness varies across different ecosystems. Reducing fuel loads to suppress wildfires and reduce crown fire risk may not be effective in all ecosystems. Evidence from the Hayman Fire in 2002 showed that reducing fuel loads had little benefit in protecting structures and communities from wildfires. Of the homes burned, a significant portion were destroyed by crown fires, highlighting the limitations of this approach. The Hayman Fire in 2002 demonstrated the limitations of reducing fuel loads to protect homes in the wildland-urban interface. Despite efforts to suppress wildfires, a significant number of homes were destroyed by crown fires, indicating the ineffectiveness of this approach. Observers suggest the need to expand low-intensity surface fires to maintain natural conditions and values. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders may be necessary for safe existence of low-intensity wildfires in surface-fire ecosystems. Prescribed burning and thinning are common methods proposed for reducing fuel loads, but caution is advised as these activities may not always prevent crown fires. Proposed methods for reducing fuel loads and modifying fuel characteristics include prescribed burning and thinning, either alone or in combination. However, caution is advised as these activities may not always prevent crown fires due to changes in microclimate and increased surface fire intensity in thinned stands. Prescribed burning involves deliberate use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas within prescribed fuel and weather conditions. It is not always controlled and can lead to extensive damage if conditions change. Some include naturally occurring fires within acceptable areas and conditions as prescribed burning. Prescribed burning primarily eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes, which feed new plant growth. Wildland fire use includes naturally occurring fires within acceptable conditions, treated as fuel reduction. Prescribed burning eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes, promoting new plant growth. However, it has limitations as it does not effectively reduce large diameter fuels and can lead to escaped fires turning into wildfires. Fire managers tend to be cautious, resulting in excessive personnel and equipment. Prescribed burning can be risky as escaped fires can turn into wildfires, leading to high implementation costs and health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies have policies in place to use naturally-occurring fires for fire management objectives. The federal land management agencies have policies in place to allow wildfires to burn with monitoring for fire management objectives. This practice, known as wildland fire use, is similar to prescribed burning but with nature as the ignition source. Thinning is also a key component. Thinning is the mechanical cutting and removing of trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. Different approaches to thinning include low thinning and crown thinning. The practice of wildland fire use allows wildfires to burn for fuel reduction treatments, similar to prescribed burning but with nature as the ignition source. Thinning alters biomass fuels through different approaches: Low thinning removes small trees, Crown thinning removes larger trees to stimulate growth, and Selection thinning removes less desirable trees. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it is controlled, can eliminate ladder fuels, and reduces crown density. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it is controlled and can eliminate ladder fuels and reduce crown density. Thinning can create targeted stand structure and reduce vertical fuel continuity, especially when emphasizing smaller trees and shrubs. However, it leaves slash as a disadvantage compared to prescribed burning. Thinning, unlike prescribed burning, can effectively reduce vertical fuel continuity and target ladder fuels and specific fuel components. However, it leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load. Mechanical treatments for slash are labor-intensive and costly. Thinning is not always intended to reduce biomass fuels but can also be used to increase desired commercial biomass growth. Thinning in forests can increase biomass growth of desired trees by concentrating growth on fewer stems. However, it can leave slash on the ground, increasing fire hazards in the short term. Thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in certain ecosystems. Mechanical treatments for slash, such as lop-and-scatter or pile-and-burn, are labor-intensive and costly operations. Thinning in forests can reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires in specific ecosystems when combined with prescribed burning. However, the effectiveness of this combined approach is limited and costly compared to other alternatives. Other activities like logging are sometimes suggested to reduce fuel loads. The effectiveness of combined thinning and prescribed burning in reducing crown fires is limited and costly. Logging, especially salvage logging of dead trees, is sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads, but it does not effectively address fuel ladders and leaves substantial slash volumes. Commercial logging focuses on large trees and does not reduce canopy fire incidence. The proposal that commercial logging can reduce canopy fires is untested in scientific literature. Commercial logging targets large trees and does not address fuel ladders or crown base height. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection of federal lands, but none are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels. Each agency is implicitly authorized to reduce fuels for fire prevention. Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been implicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels for wildfire protection within their mandate to preserve and protect lands. The agencies are directed to conserve natural resources and wildlife while also making provisions for fire protection. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been authorized to protect lands from fire and preserve natural resources since 1897. The National Park Service was created in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife.
