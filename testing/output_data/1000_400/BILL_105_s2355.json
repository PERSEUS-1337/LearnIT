    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant issue, often leading to school dropouts and increased likelihood of welfare dependence, unemployment, and criminal behavior. High rates of truancy are associated with daytime burglary and vandalism, with a significant portion of violent juvenile crime occurring during school hours. High rates of truancy are linked to high daytime burglary and vandalism rates. Up to 44 percent of violent juvenile crime occurs during school hours, with as many as 75 percent of arrested children aged 13-16 being truants. Some cities report unexcused absences as high as 70 percent, totaling up to 4,000 absences per day. The social and economic costs of truancy are significant, with only 34 percent of inmates completing high school education and a high percentage of youth entering adult prisons without completing grade school. (8) Society faces significant social and economic costs due to truancy, with a low percentage of inmates completing high school education. Truants and high school dropouts cost the Nation $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes. Effective truancy prevention programs can improve school attendance and reduce crime rates, but there is a lack of targeted funding for these programs in current law. SEC. 3. GRANTS.
