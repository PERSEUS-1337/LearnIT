    "content": "This report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. The economic value of national animal identification and traceability is acknowledged, but federal proposals have faced controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses the background of animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and highlights unresolved issues in program development. Appendices provide a timeline of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and its successor program. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and the proposal of a new approach for animal disease traceability by the USDA. This decision came after reviewing claims and counter-claims of proponents and opponents of the national animal ID system, highlighting unresolved issues in program development. Additionally, the report includes a brief chronology of the development of the U.S. NAIS and a description of major international organizations involved in animal health and trade standards. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and the proposal of a new approach for animal disease traceability by the USDA. The new Animal Disease Traceability framework allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. The USDA's new Animal Disease Traceability framework allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. USDA established a Traceability Regulation Working Group to collaborate with animal health officials and make recommendations for a proposed rule. USDA established a Traceability Regulation Working Group with state, tribal nation, and APHIS officials to develop recommendations for a proposed rule on animal disease traceability. Feedback was gathered through forums and public meetings, leading to the release of two publications outlining USDA's recommendations. USDA released two publications outlining recommendations for a proposed rule on animal disease traceability. The framework emphasizes that managing a traceability program is the responsibility of states and tribal nations, allowing flexibility in implementing mandatory animal ID and traceability capabilities. The USDA's traceability framework emphasizes that states and tribal nations are responsible for managing traceability programs. States can choose to implement no mandatory animal ID, rely on existing systems for disease control, or develop their own detailed ID system. Data collection and storage will be done by state authorities, with federal rules applying only to livestock in interstate commerce. Livestock moving interstate must have official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. The federal rules for livestock traceability will apply only to animals moving in interstate commerce. Livestock must have official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions for identification requirements will be defined in the rules, such as cattle moving directly to slaughter. Performance standards for animal disease traceability will be evaluated by each state and tribal nation. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal disease traceability. Each state and tribal nation will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual agreements. No funding for animal traceability is designated in the agriculture appropriations bill for FY2011, but funding could be considered after needs are identified. The cooperators' objectives include implementing a program for animal disease traceability of interstate movements through federal regulations. USDA will define traceability in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, with a proposed rule expected in April 2011. Funding for this initiative may be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new program. USDA plans to define animal disease traceability through federal regulations in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A proposed rule could be published in April 2011, with a 60- to 90-day comment period. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have led to economic damages and disruptions in domestic and international markets. The economic impact of major animal disease outbreaks can be devastating, causing billions of dollars in damages and disrupting markets. The United States has been fortunate to avoid catastrophic outbreaks like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), but if a similar outbreak were to occur, the cost to the cattle industry alone could range from $30 billion to $100 billion. The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks, like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), could be staggering, potentially costing the U.S. cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion. This has led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in various countries, with programs varying from voluntary in the United States to mandatory in the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. The development of animal identification and traceability systems varies across countries, from voluntary programs in the United States to mandatory programs in the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. Major importers like Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which could impact market access for U.S. livestock industries. The United States is a significant producer and exporter of livestock and animal products. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It ranks third in pork production behind China and the EU. The US is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry exports, and third in beef exports. U.S. exports of animal products make up a significant portion of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef in 2007 and 2008.

U.S. exports of animal products make up a significant portion of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef in 2007 and 2008. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for tracking purposes, including information on origins and traceability through the marketing chain. Animal ID is used for ownership and traceability, including information on origins, genetics, and traceability through the marketing chain. A national database combined with traceability is ideal for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Different countries have variations in their animal ID systems based on the information collected and the extent of traceability. Animal ID systems are used for ownership and traceability, including information on origins, genetics, and movements between birth and slaughter locations. More advanced systems also track details like sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. This helps in rapid response to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing risks to human and animal health. The focus of animal ID systems varies between countries. In the United States, it is primarily for animal health, tracing movements from birth to slaughter. In contrast, countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems for both animal health and food safety. In the United States, animal ID is primarily for health and traceability from birth to slaughter. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems that include food safety. International buyers are demanding more information on the history of animal products, leading to the evolution of traceability systems in the US. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits and criticisms of a national animal ID and traceability system in the United States. Proponents argue that it enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of outbreaks and identifying exposed populations. Critics have raised concerns about the system. An animal ID and traceability system can enhance animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of outbreaks and identifying exposed populations. It can also minimize the economic impact of disease outbreaks by controlling and eradicating animal diseases at regional and national levels. Regionalization or compartmentalization helps contain disease outbreaks to specific zones, reducing the risk of international trade restrictions. Regionalization or compartmentalization is a disease management tool that contains a disease outbreak to a specific zone, minimizing economic impact and allowing for rapid identification and containment. This approach limits the spread of harmful diseases, reduces the number of animals that need to be destroyed, and facilitates re-establishing international market access. The quicker the response to a disease outbreak, the less economic damage incurred. Increasing domestic marketing opportunities is essential for farmers and ranchers to exploit desirable production characteristics like \"organic\" or \"grass-fed\" to command higher prices in retail markets. Universal bar codes on processed food help manage inventories and verify production methods for consumers seeking specific standards. Government-coordinated programs also support these efforts. Food, including meats, is used by processors and retailers to manage inventories, add value, and monitor consumer buying. ID and traceability help verify production methods for organic, humane treatment, or environmental standards. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Process Verification program, assist livestock and meat producers in providing consistent quality products through independent audits. Suppliers under this program can make marketing claims on breeds and feeding practices. USDA's \"Process Verified\" suppliers ensure consistent quality products through independent audits. Traceability programs provide valuable management tools for producers, offering post-mortem information on production techniques and tracking performance. A traceability program provides valuable management tools for producers by tracking performance history and increasing transparency in the supply chain. It also helps maintain records on animal movements, health, and marketing activities, addressing food safety and national security concerns. An animal ID and traceability program would assist livestock producers in maintaining records on animal movements, health, breed registries, and marketing activities. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state food safety agencies to protect the food supply from threats to human health and foodborne illnesses. This system could facilitate food recalls, contain the spread of foodborne illnesses, and help authorities prevent future incidents. A more rigorous traceback and animal ID system could facilitate food recalls, contain the spread of foodborne illnesses, and help prevent future incidents. However, some in the food industry argue that such a system would be costly and technically unworkable. Additionally, traceability systems enhance foreign marketing opportunities for animal products by reassuring buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meeting foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. In the global marketplace, animal disease programs, aided by traceability systems, reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meet foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan, improving opportunities for niche markets. After BSE appeared in North America in 2003, USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan, improving opportunities for niche markets. The EV program establishes standards for U.S. suppliers to ship beef to countries like Japan, Korea, and others, enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. exports. Establishing an internationally recognized traceability system is crucial for U.S. animal product exports and gaining \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health. Implementing a national animal identification system could enhance U.S. export competitiveness and support domestic price structures. It could also improve animal welfare during natural disasters by helping locate and rescue at-risk animal populations. Opponents argue that such a system may have drawbacks. Opponents argue that a national animal ID system constitutes an invasion of privacy and increases costs and technical complexity. They are concerned about the collection of personal information and potential disclosure of proprietary data, as well as the higher costs of implementation. Critics argue that a national animal ID system could lead to government invasion of privacy and public disclosure of proprietary information. They also raise concerns about increased costs and technical complexity, particularly for producers, with no guaranteed market benefits. The implementation of a national animal ID program is expected to heavily impact the cattle sector, with over 90% of the costs falling on cattle producers. The technology requirements for the program could also pose challenges for operators, potentially exceeding their capabilities. Critics argue that the program favors vertical integration over family farms, putting cattle producers at a disadvantage in both domestic and international markets. Small operators may struggle to absorb the additional costs, eroding their profitability further. Critics argue that a national animal ID program would disadvantage cattle producers, especially small family farms, due to added costs and lack of market power. Some religious groups object to individual animal marking as a sign of the apocalypse. Large retailers may shift compliance costs to farms, making it harder for independent operators to stay in business. The national animal ID program may lead to increased compliance costs for farms and ranches, potentially impacting smaller, independent operators. Some religious groups view individual animal marking as a negative sign. Producers may resist due to concerns about increased transparency leading to higher tax liabilities. The program has evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts. The national animal ID program has evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts, with programs for animal disease control requiring ID and tracking. For example, brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in a eradication program, leading to the largely eradication of brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds. The national animal ID program, stemming from disease control efforts, required animal identification components for tracking. Brucellosis ID tags were attached to animals as part of an eradication program, leading to successful eradication from U.S. commercial herds. ID requirements exist for livestock entering interstate commerce, such as for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. State laws and breed association rules also mandate identification for animals participating in shows or races. After the successful eradication of Brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds through animal identification programs, requirements for livestock entering interstate commerce were established. These requirements include official identification for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. However, the national animal ID programs vary in scope and methods, leading to challenges in tracing animals, as seen after the discovery of BSE in the United States in 2003. Trading partners were hesitant to reopen borders due to difficulties in tracking the whereabouts of infected cattle. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, established in 2002, aimed to improve animal tracing efforts after the discovery of BSE in the United States in 2003. Despite some states mandating components like premises registration, NAIS was a voluntary national program administered by USDA's APHIS to enhance animal health safeguarding. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was a voluntary program administered by USDA's APHIS, aimed at improving animal tracing efforts. However, due to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector regarding cost and implementation burden, NAIS was replaced in 2010 with a more flexible, state-based program mandating traceability for livestock moving in interstate commerce. This discussion, while focusing on the outdated NAIS system, remains relevant for the potential implementation of a new system to replace it. The NAIS system faced criticism from the U.S. cattle sector due to cost and implementation burden, primarily affecting cattle producers. It aimed to cover major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., excluding household pets. The system was replaced in 2010 with a state-based program for livestock traceability in interstate commerce. The NAIS system in the United States focused on identifying animals raised for sports or recreation, excluding household pets. It was voluntary and aimed to identify animals entering commerce or interacting with animals at other premises. The USDA's role was to promote the program, provide information to participants, and address implementation issues by species/sectors. USDA's role in the NAIS system was to popularize the program, ensure information availability, and address implementation issues by species/sectors. This included harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states/tribes/territories, collaborating with industry, and advancing ID technologies. USDA published reports for participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. USDA published reports to provide guidance on the NAIS program, including participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. One report detailed recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability, while another provided a user guide for program participation. Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies and actions to enhance animal disease traceability by harmonizing existing animal health programs and identification techniques. The NAIS User Guide, published in 2006, offered guidance to producers and owners on participating in NAIS. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS, including formats for identification numbers and official identification devices. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document for NAIS established data standards for premises, animal, and group/lot identification numbers to ensure system compatibility. The primary goal of NAIS was to protect U.S. agriculture from the potential harm of animal disease outbreaks. The primary goal of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was to protect U.S. agriculture from the harm of animal disease outbreaks. USDA set specific goals for NAIS, including increasing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem. The USDA's goal with the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was to quickly identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease outbreak to protect animal producers and maintain market access. NAIS aimed to provide animal health officials with the necessary data to contain outbreaks and limit economic damage by identifying infected animals, their locations, and potential exposure to the disease. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to quickly trace animals in a disease outbreak back to their original premises and identify other animals that may have been exposed. NAIS consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. States and tribes had to collect specific information for premises registration, including premises identification number (PIN) and contact details. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required premises registration to track the geographic location of livestock or poultry. States and tribes had to collect key information such as premises identification number (PIN), contact details, and operational data. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, remained constant even with changes in ownership. Multiple PINs could be assigned to a producer based on different production activities at various locations. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number assigned to a location, remains constant despite changes in ownership. Producers can have multiple PINs based on different production activities at various locations. Premises registration is free and managed by state or tribal animal health authorities. The USDA maintains premises information in a National Premises Information Repository to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks or animal health events. The USDA established the National Premises Information Repository to protect private and business information. Premises information helps notify producers of disease outbreaks quickly and locate at-risk animals in emergencies. By 2009, only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. Higher participation levels were needed for successful NAIS implementation. As of September 6, 2009, only 37% of premises were registered under the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. Higher participation levels were needed for successful implementation. The second phase of NAIS involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups, such as a 15-digit Animal Identification Number (AIN) with the first three numbers being the country code 840. An Animal Identification Number (AIN) is a unique 15-digit code, with the first three numbers representing the country code (840 for the United States). AIN devices can include visual ear-tags, RFID tags, and injectable transponders for electronic identification. USDA-recognized tags or devices are used for animal ID under NAIS. The USDA does not specify specific identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders is increasing as they allow for faster access to ID information and reduce stress on animals. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if their movement poses a low risk. The USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises for disease control, even if animals do not leave their birth premises. RFID and electronic transponder devices make it easier to access ID information without approaching or restraining animals, reducing stress and improving data quality. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if their movement poses a low risk. The USDA encourages animal owners to register their premises for disease control, even if animals do not leave. Animals should have an ID attached before moving to another location. Producers can choose when to attach ID devices, either shortly after birth or later. If animals cannot be tagged at their current premises, they can be tagged at an auction market before being unloaded. Producers may choose to tag their animals at auction markets if they cannot do so at their current premises. Animals brought into operations should maintain their official identification. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain. The use of group/lot identification numbers (GINs) is a common practice in the poultry and pork industries, allowing animals to be identified as a group rather than individually. The GIN consists of a 15-character number generated by the producer, including a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. This system helps maintain identification throughout the production chain. The GIN is a 15-character number generated by the producer, consisting of a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. This system links each producer's livestock or poultry flock to the animal's birthplace or premises of origin, allowing for accurate animal movement records in the event of a disease outbreak. The NAIS protocol involves tracking animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during a disease outbreak. Producers can report movements to NAIS-compliant databases maintained by states and private industry. Minimum tracing information includes national premises ID, animal ID, date of event, and event type. Under NAIS, only minimum, standardized tracing information is required for participation, including national premises ID, animal ID, date of event, and event type. Other animal-specific data like age and species are standardized but not necessary. Movements within a production unit for management purposes are not required to be reported for NAIS. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership where industry and states maintain animal tracking databases (ATDs) for disease control. The federal government operates a portal system for officials to request information from ATDs during disease investigations, ensuring participant confidentiality. The USDA's plan for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involves states and private entities maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for confidentiality. The federal government would operate the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for officials to request information during disease investigations. ATDs provide timely reports for disease containment within a 48-hour window. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involves maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for disease containment within a 48-hour window. State and federal officials use the system for disease investigations and traceback/traceforward in specific situations. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States were registered, with varying participation across species and states. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States were registered for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), with varying participation across species and states. Poultry and sheep had a registration rate of 95%, swine 80%, goats 60%, horses 50%, and cattle 18%. 531,284 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered in one of the available databases, representing 36.9% of the estimated 1.4 million livestock and poultry farms in the United States. Achieving a \"critical mass\" level of participation is necessary for an effective response to an animal disease outbreak. The USDA estimated that 70% of animals in a specific species need to be identified and traceable to achieve a \"critical mass\" level for effective response to an animal disease outbreak. Dr. John Clifford suggested a participation rate of 70-90% for effective traceability. Dr. John Clifford, USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer, emphasized the need for a participation rate of 70-90% of animals in a specific species to ensure effective traceability. Some supporters criticized USDA for slow progress in implementing the animal ID program, as highlighted in a 2007 GAO report identifying various obstacles to successful implementation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified problems hindering effective implementation of animal ID, such as lack of prioritization among species, integration plan with existing requirements, and data requirements. USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address GAO criticisms, but slow progress was attributed to unresolved issues among producers. Low participation rates in the voluntary NAIS program raised concerns about achieving the 48-hour traceback window effectiveness. USDA officials called for Congress to address low participation rates by increasing incentives. The USDA officials expressed concern over low participation rates in the voluntary NAIS program, calling for Congress to address this by increasing incentives or making the program mandatory. Various organizations, including the AVMA and state animal health officials, also supported mandatory participation in NAIS for all U.S. breeding cattle. Veterinarians, consumer advocacy groups, and livestock industry organizations in the United States support mandatory participation in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The USDA, along with key congressional figures, are interested in implementing NAIS as a mandatory program to prevent losses in the livestock industry. The American Meat Institute (AMI) supports a mandatory animal identification system, backed by key congressional figures like Collin Peterson and Rosa DeLauro. Opponents, mainly from the cattle industry, including R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, fear high costs and industry concentration. The cattle industry, including R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, opposes mandatory or voluntary animal identification programs due to concerns about high costs, industry concentration, and confidentiality of information. Some members of Congress from cattle-producing regions share these concerns. In August 2006, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that the USDA would continue to implement the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) as a voluntary program, despite calls for it to be mandatory. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to determine if NAIS is voluntary or mandatory. In 2006, Secretary Johanns announced NAIS would remain voluntary. Proponents argue Secretary Vilsack could make it mandatory. Implementing an animal ID system incurs costs for tags, data systems, and traceability. Cost estimates for a national system vary widely due to different assumptions. The U.S. livestock industry faces costs for implementing an animal ID system, including tags, data systems, and traceability. Cost estimates for a national system vary widely, with questions arising on who should bear the expenses - the industry, government, or both. USDA suggests sharing costs, but concerns exist that compliance costs may be shifted back to farms and ranches by larger retailers and meat packers. The implementation of an animal ID system in the U.S. livestock industry raises concerns about cost allocation between government and producers. Larger retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms and ranches, potentially impacting smaller, independent operations. However, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds could benefit from traceability requirements by accessing niche market opportunities. A study by APHIS and Kansas State University assessed the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) analyzed the economic impacts of implementing USDA's NAIS, with key assumptions on individual and group ID tagging for different species. The study showed potential benefits for smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds and niche market opportunities. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) analyzed the costs of implementing NAIS for livestock industries. Costs for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation were estimated at $228 million, expanding to $304.2 million with horses included. Cattle sector costs accounted for over 90% of the total, at $5.97 per animal marketed. The cost of implementing NAIS for livestock industries with 100% participation is estimated at $304.2 million, with over 90% of the costs associated with the cattle sector at $5.97 per animal marketed. Identification tags and tagging cattle make up 75% of the annual adoption costs, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. Other livestock sectors have lower average costs per animal marketed. The estimated tag and tagging costs for cattle producers ranged from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal, compared to the average cost of $5.97 per marketed animal in the cattle industry. Other livestock sectors had lower costs per animal: $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The study showed that the economic benefits of NAIS with full participation outweighed the costs, including savings in government administration, market access, and avoidance of significant losses. The administration of animal disease control and eradication programs has economic benefits such as quickly re-establishing markets after outbreaks, expanded market access, and increased consumer demand. The study found that the implementation of NAIS becomes more cost-effective with higher participation levels, but may not be viable at lower levels. Some producers are concerned about liability for contamination post-farm, while others see benefits in documenting management practices. Some producers are concerned about liability for contamination post-farm and public scrutiny of their records, including potential misuse of information gained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Some producers have concerns about potential misuse of information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), especially regarding proprietary business information. In the 110th Congress, a provision in the omnibus 2008 farm bill was deleted that would have addressed the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2419, the omnibus 2008 farm bill enacted as P.L. 110-246, included regulations for protecting trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to implement traceability requirements for imported beef by December 2010, while the EU mandates individual identification and traceability for all suppliers. Japan currently does not require traceability for imported beef but has other specifications in place. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for BSE measures and beef traceability if elected. Japan does not require traceability for imported beef, but the Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for BSE measures and beef traceability if elected. The DPJ won 308 seats in the Japanese Diet and hopes to form a coalition to push through legislation. India is the only other top beef exporter without a traceability system. The DPJ in Japan aims to prioritize its agenda and set up a new administration, making it unlikely to address the issue of traceability on imported meat as an early priority. The implementation of traceability measures for imports must comply with WTO rules on non-tariff trade barriers. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures sets rules for non-tariff trade barriers like traceability requirements for beef. Imported traceability measures must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. The USDA has invested $142 million in the NAIS since 2004, but participation remains low at 40% of livestock. Since early 2004, USDA has invested nearly $142 million in the development of NAIS, with low participation rates of about 40% among livestock producers by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to address concerns and gather feedback on NAIS implementation. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The information obtained from these sessions led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010, after Congress expressed frustration with the slow implementation of NAIS. Approximately $142 million was allocated for NAIS from FY2004 to FY2009. In 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system due to Congress's frustration with slow implementation. Approximately $142 million was allocated for NAIS from FY2004 to FY2009, with Congress directing APHIS to make progress in implementing the program. Funding for NAIS was eliminated from the FY2010 budget. In 2009, funding for the USDA's NAIS was proposed to increase to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate the funding from the appropriations bill. Subcommittee members expressed frustration with the slow progress of the national sign-up for NAIS despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee expressed frustration with the slow progress of the national sign-up for the animal ID program, despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The committee's report stated that continued investments in the current NAIS are unwarranted until USDA provides details on how it will implement an effective ID system. An amendment reduced the FY2010 funding to $7.3 million and explicitly restricted its use to ongoing NAIS efforts. The Senate reduced FY2010 funding for the NAIS program to $7.3 million, with restrictions on its use. The final funding level was set at $5.3 million, signed into law in October 2009. USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. The final FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million and signed into law in October 2009. USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority or establishing a national ID system were proposed but not adopted. In the 111th Congress, various bills were introduced to establish comprehensive traceability systems for meat, poultry, and other FDA-regulated foods. These bills aimed to trace animals and products from slaughter through processing and distribution to the consumer. In the 111th Congress, bills like 814 (DeGette) and S. 425 (Brown) proposed traceability systems for meat and poultry products, requiring FSIS to establish a system to trace animals and products from slaughter to the consumer. These bills also authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to require record-keeping for traceability purposes. In the 111th Congress, bills proposed traceability systems for meat and poultry products, requiring FSIS to establish a system to trace animals and products from slaughter to the consumer. The House and Senate considered a bill (S. 510) for FDA-regulated foods, not FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products. The 111th Congress held hearings on the National Animal ID System (NAIS) in the House, focusing on animal identification systems and bio-security. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has a long history in the United States, dating back to the 1800s with hot iron brands used for identification. In the 1940s, the USDA implemented a successful program for identifying vaccinated cattle for brucellosis. However, as brucellosis has been nearly eradicated, the system has been phased out. In the 1950s-1980s, USDA implemented a successful program for identifying cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. As brucellosis neared eradication, the tagging and ID system was phased out. In the 1980s, plans for a national animal identification system began to take shape. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" was first identified in the UK, believed to be transmitted through infected cattle parts. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" was first identified in the UK's cattle and dairy herds, believed to be transmitted through feeding infected cattle parts. This led to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan resulted in $6.9 billion in losses and the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs. Similarly, a major outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands led to the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in economic losses. In 2001, an outbreak of FMD in the United Kingdom led to the forced slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing an estimated $7.9 billion in losses and eradication costs. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated with various organizations to draft an early version of an animal ID plan. By December 2003, a draft of the \"U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP)\" was published, calling for recording animal identification information. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated with organizations to draft an early version of an animal ID plan. By December 2003, a draft \"U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP)\" was published, calling for recording animal movement in a central database. APHIS was to design an ID numbering system and coordinate data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and major species identified by July 2006. In December 2003, a draft \"U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP)\" was published, calling for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and major species identified by July 2006. Following the detection of mad cow disease in the United States, Secretary Ann Veneman announced the framework for implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) on April 27, 2004. Secretary Ann Veneman used emergency authority to transfer $18.8 million from CCC funds to APHIS for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in April 2004. The program's framework was announced, periodically revised, and a Draft Strategic Plan with timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009 was issued in May 2005. USDA announced Draft Program Standards in August 2005 and unveiled Implementation Strategies in April 2006 for full implementation by 2009. In 2005, USDA announced Draft Program Standards and in April 2006 unveiled Implementation Strategies for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The program was initially planned to transition from voluntary to mandatory, but in August 2006, it was announced to remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" as the most current plan for NAIS. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining the three-step approach to implementing the voluntary National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The guide assured livestock producers of the program's voluntary nature and commitment to protecting private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the NAIS User Guide and Additional Information Resource, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008. The USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide in December 2007, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008. The Business Plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving a 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. Livestock and poultry were categorized based on priority, with commercial food animals and horses in Tier 1. The NAIS set benchmarks for achieving a 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. Livestock and poultry were categorized into Tier 1 and Tier 2 based on priority. A proposed rule was published in January 2009 to establish the seven-character PIN as the standard location identifier. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April to June 2009 with various stakeholders. The proposed rule to establish a seven-character PIN as the standard location identifier for the NAIS was open for comment until March 16, 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on animal identification and traceability. USDA released the results of a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS in April 2009. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing the NAIS. In April 2009, USDA released the results of a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach to animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of animal identification. USDA will require all animals moving in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The USDA held public meetings from March to August 2010 on Animal Disease Traceability framework. All animals in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. APHIS released documents in August 2010 outlining a proposed rule on traceability. United States participates in international organizations for animal health and trade. The United States participates in international organizations such as the CODEX alimentarius, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock and animal products. U.S. livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards imposed by importing countries. The WTO sets international trade rules for harmonizing participation in commerce and dispute settlement, while the CODEX alimentarius and OIE recommend standards for food safety and animal health. The United States, as a member of the WTO, agrees to abide by international trade rules for harmonizing commerce and dispute settlement. The CODEX alimentarius and OIE recommend standards for food safety and animal health, but they are not international laws. The WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements for human, animal, or plant health. The WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures limits traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements for human, animal, or plant health. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, created by the FAO and WHO, develops food standards to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices. The FAO and WHO collaborate to develop food standards and guidelines under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices. The OIE, founded in 1924, is responsible for improving animal health worldwide and setting international standards for animal identification and traceability. The OIE is an intergovernmental organization focused on improving animal health globally through setting international standards for animal identification and traceability. They help member countries implement systems to enhance disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. In 2006, the OIE established guidelines on identification and traceability, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. Chapter four of the OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on general principles and animal tracing. The OIE established guidelines on identification and traceability in 2006, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. The Terrestrial Code includes sections on general principles and animal tracing. The Director General called for global implementation of animal identification and tracing systems from \"farm to fork\" to enhance disease control and trade facilitation. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes guidelines for animal identification and tracing systems to enhance disease control and trade facilitation. Certification for export verification is handled by USDA's FSIS, ensuring compliance with importing countries' requirements. Certification for export verification is managed by USDA's FSIS in the United States, ensuring compliance with importing countries' veterinary, animal health, and sanitary standards. The OIE contributes to international certification standards harmonization through its programs and promotion of transparency and reliance on scientific information. Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines general obligations and procedures related to certification. The OIE promotes transparency and relies on scientific information for evaluation. Chapter 5 of the Terrestrial Code outlines certification obligations and procedures. Many countries have national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities, such as Canada's CCIA managing a system for cattle and bison. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) is a nonprofit organization managing Canada's national identification system for cattle and bison. It works closely with the government's Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) to ensure funding for development. Animal identification for cattle became mandatory in 2002, initially using ear tags approved by the CCIA. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) transitioned from voluntary to mandatory animal identification for cattle in 2002. By 2006, all cattle leaving their farm of origin must have a CCIA-approved RFID tag for tracking purposes. The RFID tags offer benefits such as tag retention, data integrity, and future tracking capabilities. As of March 2009, the compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID was estimated to be between 99-100%. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) mandates RFID tags for cattle tracking since 2002. Benefits include tag retention, data integrity, and future tracking capabilities. Compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID is 99-100%. Personal info is securely stored in the national database. CLTS manages ID and traceback systems for various industry groups. Sheep and hog ID programs in Canada gained mandatory status in 2004 and 2008. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) manages national ID and traceback systems for various industry groups including dairy, beef, bison, sheep, pork, and poultry. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs in Canada were established in 2004 and 2008. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is a whole-of-life system for electronic identification and traceability of livestock, with mandatory cattle identification since 2005 and operational tracing systems for sheep and goats since 2009. Similar systems are being developed for pigs and alpacas. Australia implemented an animal identification system in the 1960s to eradicate diseases like bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory property identification system for cattle was established in 1967, using Property Identification Codes (PICs) to trace cattle back to their last residence. In the mid-1990s, the system transitioned to electronic identification using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs). In the mid-1990s, the visual-read-only PIC system for cattle identification was converted to an electronic system using RFIDs. This transition was driven by the need for biosecurity, food safety, and market access. Individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market in 1998, leading to the introduction of the NLIS in 1999. A 2004 audit showed that NLIS successfully traced all identified animals back to their origin within 24 hours, highlighting its effectiveness compared to non-tagged cattle. In 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, with unique ID numbers assigned to each animal at slaughter. This allows for tracing of animals to their origin and linking of information to carcasses and byproducts. At slaughter in Australia, each animal is given a unique ID number linked to barcodes for traceability. However, individual animal information is not always available as animals are usually grouped into lots by harvest date and time. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) in Australia is a partnership between the government and industry, with the federal government coordinating policy and funding, while state governments manage livestock movement and health. The Australian Government, both at federal and state levels, along with the Australian industry, collaborate on the National Livestock Identification System. The Federal government provides funding and policy coordination, while state governments oversee livestock movement and health. Joint management committees between state governments and industry develop legislation for animal identification. State governments manage PIC registries, order identification devices, and ensure compliance with legislative requirements. Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is a private industry company involved in the system. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) in Australia is overseen by state governments, who manage PIC registries, order identification devices, and ensure compliance with legislative requirements. Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) administers the database for NLIS, protecting data from Australian Freedom of Information laws. In the European Union, animal identification is classified under \"food safety\" programs with mandatory regulations for major commercial animal species. EU rules focus on localizing and tracing animals. The European Union (EU) has mandatory programs for animal identification as part of its \"food safety\" initiatives. The EU rules aim to localize and trace animals for veterinary purposes and disease control. Various species-specific ID systems have been developed in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent animal identification in 1997 following the BSE crisis. In response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease, the EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent animal identification in 1997. This system includes double ear tags for individual bovine animals, cattle passports, and a national database for tracking movements. A mandatory bovine ID and traceability system was fully implemented in the EU in 2000, requiring cattle passports and a national database for tracking movements. Meat products must be labeled with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state where they were processed, and the facility's approval number. Equidae in the EU must have a passport for movement since 2000. Since 2000, the EU has implemented mandatory ID and traceability systems for cattle, equidae, porcine, ovine, and caprine animals. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in place since 2004. Imported beef in Japan is not subject to the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef. Japan implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in 2004, tracking domestic animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently lacks the same traceability requirements, but pressure for change is growing due to food safety crises. The Japanese government implemented animal traceability regulations and food safety oversight after labeling scandals. Laws were enacted in phases, requiring traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 2003, and extending traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2004. Retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. The Beef Traceability Law in Japan required traceability to be extended to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. Japan also introduced a Japan Agricultural Standard program for certifying the traceability of imported beef. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System initiated in 2004. South Korea implemented a mandatory Beef Traceability System in 2004, which became mandatory for domestically produced beef in 2009. The system requires individual identification and registration in a central database, tracking each animal from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, location of birth, feed, and medications administered. The BTS in South Korea tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, location of birth, feed, medications, slaughter date, and processing location. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a national animal ID system but established the AITWG in 2004 to improve traceability. New Zealand initiated the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group (AITWG) in 2004 to enhance animal traceability. The National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) system was established in 2006 but is still in development as of 2009. Current systems in New Zealand provide traceability at herd levels but lack effectiveness for individual animals, with gaps at the national level. The focus is on developing traceability for cattle and deer populations. New Zealand's current animal ID systems, MINDA and NBTIP, were established under the Bio-security Act of 1993. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is focusing on developing traceability for cattle and deer populations before considering other species for the NAIT system. New Zealand's existing animal ID systems, MINDA and NBTIP, were established under the Bio-security Act of 1993. MINDA is a voluntary herd management system with high dairy herd participation, while NBTIP is mandatory for cattle and deer traceability. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil, with the inclusion of deer dependent on the performance of radio frequency tags. Brazil established the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) in 2001, which was later extended to include the entire beef chain. Initially intended as mandatory, domestic market demand and resistance from cattle producers delayed national participation. SISBOV, established in 2001, was extended to the entire beef chain in September 2006. Originally mandatory, it remains voluntary due to lack of domestic demand and producer resistance. The program focuses on providing origination information for export markets like the EU, requiring group lot identification instead of individual animals. The EU, Brazil's largest beef export market, has strict identification and traceability criteria for imported animal products. Despite shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification system, the EU accepted individual tags for cattle sold to export slaughterhouses. In 2008, the EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil due to concerns about foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU. A 2009 report by the EU suggests that the situation in Brazil was deteriorating, with Europe worried about a lack of robust information and disease risks. The EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil, citing concerns about foot-and-mouth disease and lack of robust information. Argentina established a limited mandatory animal identification system for exports to the EU. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system for cattle destined for export markets, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. The system aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, but the entire beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017. Due to historical disease control issues, particularly foot and mouth disease, Argentina's beef exports to the United States are limited to thermo-processed beef. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system for cattle destined for export markets, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. The entire beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017. Uruguay heavily relies on foreign markets for selling its beef production, with 68% sold abroad during 2004-2008. Uruguay has a strong incentive to provide animal identification and traceability information to meet foreign buyers' demands, with a comprehensive national program established in late 2006. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in late 2006. All cattle must be tagged with two tags before six months of age or before being transported. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) requires all cattle to be tagged with two tags before six months of age or before being transported. The government plans to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The Uruguayan government established the DICOSE identification system in 1973 for producers to track individual animals in their herds. SNIG requires cattle to be tagged with two tags before six months of age. Movement notification is done through private individuals or companies registered within SNIG, with termination records recorded by MAGyP. The database includes premises, animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently covers the cost of ID tags but plans to shift the cost to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations and land masses. Not all countries with large animal populations have ongoing animal ID programs, such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Reasons for this include large agrarian populations, lack of technological advancement, and reliance on local production and marketing processes. In poorer countries, consumers may not be willing to pay extra for traceable food."
