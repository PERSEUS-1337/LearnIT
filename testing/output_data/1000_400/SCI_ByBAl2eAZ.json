Alternatively, adding noise directly to the agent's parameters can lead to more consistent exploration. Combining parameter noise with traditional RL methods benefits both off- and on-policy methods, improving exploration in deep RL. Exploration in deep reinforcement learning is a key challenge, as it aims to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Various methods have been proposed to address this challenge, such as noise injection in the action space or adding temporally-correlated noise to increase exploration. These methods often rely on complex structures like counting tables, density modeling, learned dynamics models, or self-supervised curiosity. The addition of temporally-correlated noise in deep reinforcement learning algorithms enhances exploration by introducing a larger variety of behaviors in the policy. This approach is orthogonal to other methods like noise injection in the action space or complex structures such as counting tables or density modeling. However, existing approaches have limitations in terms of evaluation settings and disregard temporal structure and gradient information. This paper explores combining parameter space noise with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO to enhance exploratory behavior. Results show that parameter noise outperforms traditional action space noise in tasks with sparse reward signals, applicable to both discrete and continuous environments. Experiments demonstrate that parameter noise is more effective than traditional action space noise in tasks with sparse rewards, applicable to high-dimensional discrete environments and continuous control tasks. The study focuses on the standard RL framework with an agent interacting in a fully observable environment modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The goal is to maximize the expected discounted return. The curr_chunk discusses the components of reinforcement learning, including states, actions, initial state distribution, reward function, transition probabilities, time horizon, and discount factor. It introduces the concept of a policy \u03c0 \u03b8 that the agent aims to optimize for maximizing expected return. Two off-policy algorithms, Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), are considered for learning from data captured by arbitrary policies. DQN utilizes a deep neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value. The paper discusses off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). DQN uses a deep neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value function, while DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action spaces. The DDPG algorithm utilizes a stochastic policy derived from the Q-value function to encourage exploration in continuous action spaces. The actor is trained to maximize the critic's estimated Q-values by back-propagating through both networks, using off-policy data from a replay buffer. Exploration is achieved through action space noise, either uncorrelated or correlated, to update function approximators. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is an on-policy method that improves upon traditional policy gradient methods by ensuring a small change in the policy distribution. It computes an ascent direction using discounted state-visitation frequencies and advantage values. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) improves upon REINFORCE by computing an ascent direction that ensures a small change in the policy distribution. TRPO solves a constrained optimization problem with discounted state-visitation frequencies and advantage functions. Policies are represented as parameterized functions, such as neural networks, and structured exploration is achieved by sampling from policies with additive Gaussian noise. Policies are represented as parameterized functions, denoted as \u03c0 \u03b8, with structured exploration achieved by sampling from policies with additive Gaussian noise. State-dependent exploration involves perturbing the policy at the beginning of each episode and keeping it fixed for the entire rollout. State-dependent exploration involves perturbing the policy parameters at the beginning of each episode, ensuring consistency in actions for the same state sampled in the rollout. This introduces a dependence between the state and the exploratory action taken. Perturbing deep neural networks with spherical Gaussian noise can be achieved by a simple reparameterization of the network, as shown by Salimans et al. (2017). Layer normalization between perturbed layers allows for consistent perturbation scale across all layers, despite different sensitivities to noise. Adaptive noise scaling in parameter space is proposed as a solution to address the challenges of selecting a suitable scale \u03c3 for noise in deep neural networks. This approach aims to ensure consistent perturbation scale across all layers, despite varying sensitivities to noise, by normalizing activations within each layer. Adaptive noise scaling in parameter space is proposed as a solution to address challenges in selecting noise scale for deep neural networks. This approach aims to normalize activations within each layer to ensure consistent perturbation scale across all layers. The proposed solution involves adapting the scale of parameter space noise over time and relating it to the variance in action space induced by the noise. This is achieved by defining a distance measure between perturbed and non-perturbed policy in action space and adjusting the parameter space noise based on a threshold value. Parameter space noise can be adjusted based on a threshold value, with a scaling factor and threshold value. In off-policy methods, noise is applied for exploration, while in on-policy methods, noise is incorporated using an adapted policy gradient. Parameter space noise can be incorporated in on-policy methods using an adapted policy gradient. The expected return can be expanded using likelihood ratios and the re-parametrization trick for N samples. The value of \u03a3 is fixed to \u03c3 2 I and scaled adaptively. This section addresses the benefits of incorporating parameter space noise in state-of-the-art RL algorithms and its effectiveness in exploring sparse reward environments. This section evaluates the impact of incorporating parameter space noise in state-of-the-art RL algorithms and its effectiveness in exploring sparse reward environments. It compares the benefits of parameter space noise exploration against evolution strategies for deep policies and measures the added value over action space noise in both discrete-action and continuous control tasks. Reference implementations of DQN and DDPG with adaptive parameter space noise are available online for further exploration. The added value of parameter space noise is evaluated on high-dimensional discrete-action environments and continuous control tasks using DQN, DDPG, and TRPO. In discrete environments, a comparison is made between DQN with -greedy action noise and DQN with parameter noise, with a linear annealing schedule. Parameter noise scale is adjusted based on KL divergence between perturbed and non-perturbed policies for fair comparison. For parameter noise, the scale is adjusted based on KL divergence between perturbed and non-perturbed policies to ensure fair comparison. Parameter perturbation involves reparametrizing the network to represent the greedy policy implied by Q-values, rather than perturbing the Q-function directly. This is achieved by adding a fully connected layer and softmax output layer to predict a discrete probability distribution over actions given a state. Incorporating an explicit policy representing the greedy policy implied by Q-values involves adding a fully connected layer and softmax output layer to predict a probability distribution over actions given a state. Training the policy involves maximizing the probability of outputting the greedy action according to the current Q-network, resulting in more meaningful changes compared to perturbing the Q-function directly. This approach is compared against regular DQN and two-headed DQN baselines. The policy is trained to mimic the behavior of running greedy DQN by maximizing the probability of outputting the greedy action. Parameter space noise approach is compared against regular DQN and two-headed DQN with -greedy exploration. Random actions are sampled for the first 50 thousand timesteps to fill the replay buffer before training. Combining parameter space noise with a bit of action space noise yields better results.

DQN, prioritized experience replay, and dueling networks are suggested to improve results further. The comparison of parameter noise with action noise on continuous control environments in OpenAI Gym is conducted using DDPG as the RL algorithm with different noise configurations. In comparing noise configurations for continuous control tasks, different types of noise were evaluated: no noise, uncorrelated additive Gaussian action space noise, correlated additive Gaussian action space noise, and adaptive parameter space noise. Results were assessed on various environments, with each agent trained for 1 million timesteps. Performance was measured every 10 thousand steps to ensure comparability between configurations. The performance of different noise configurations was evaluated on continuous control tasks. Parameter space noise outperformed other exploration schemes on HalfCheetah environment, breaking out of sub-optimal behavior. It significantly surpassed correlated action space noise, indicating its effectiveness. Parameter space noise outperforms correlated action space noise on the HalfCheetah environment, indicating significant differences between the two. DDPG can learn good policies even without noise, suggesting well-shaped reward functions in the environments. TRPO results are shown in FIG4, with parameter noise showing interesting effects in the Walker2D environment. DDPG is effective in learning good policies, as seen in various environments with well-shaped reward functions. Parameter noise in the Walker2D environment reduces performance variance between seeds, aiding in escaping local optima. The study evaluates if parameter noise can help RL algorithms learn in environments with sparse rewards, where uncorrelated action noise fails. Additionally, a toy example is used to demonstrate the impact of parameter noise on learning. In this section, the evaluation of parameter noise on RL algorithms in environments with sparse rewards is conducted using a toy example with a chain of states. Different DQN variations are compared, varying the chain length N and evaluating with different seeds after each episode. The study compares adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a toy example with a chain of states. The chain length N is varied, and performance is evaluated with different seeds after each episode. The goal is to achieve the optimal return within one hundred subsequent rollouts. Experimental details are available in Section A.3, with green indicating problem solved and blue indicating no solution found within 2K episodes. The study compares adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a toy example with a chain of states. The goal is to achieve the optimal return within subsequent rollouts. Parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and even the more computationally expensive bootstrapped DQN. However, the environment is simple, where the optimal strategy is always to go right. In a comparison of adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a simple environment, parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and bootstrapped DQN. However, the optimal strategy is always to go right in this environment. Continuous control environments are made more challenging by using sparse rewards, where rewards are only given after significant progress towards a goal. Various environments like SparseCartpoleSwingup, SparseDoublePendulum, SparseHalfCheetah, SparseMountainCar, and SwimmerGather are considered, each with specific reward conditions. Tasks have a time horizon of T = 500 steps before resetting, and DDPG and TRPO are used to solve these environments. SparseDoublePendulum is relatively easy to solve with DDPG, while SparseCartpoleSwingup and SparseMountainCar require parameter space noise for successful policy learning. The results show that SparseDoublePendulum is easy to solve with DDPG, while SparseCartpoleSwingup and SparseMountainCar require parameter space noise for successful policy learning. SparseHalfCheetah finds non-zero rewards but fails to learn a successful policy. SwimmerGather task proves challenging for all DDPG configurations. Parameter space noise can improve exploration behavior, but it's not guaranteed for all cases. Parameter space noise can enhance exploration behavior in off-the-shelf algorithms, but its effectiveness varies by task. Evolution strategies also use noise for exploration but lack temporal information. Combining parameter space noise with traditional RL algorithms allows for improved exploration while still utilizing back-propagation for optimization. Parameter space noise can enhance exploration behavior in off-the-shelf algorithms, but its effectiveness varies by task. Evolution strategies (ES) disregard temporal information and use black-box optimization, while combining parameter space noise with traditional RL algorithms allows for improved exploration with back-propagation optimization. Comparing ES and traditional RL with parameter space noise directly on 21 ALE games shows that DQN with parameter space noise, trained on 40 M frames, outperforms ES trained on 1,000 M frames. The final policy with exploration disabled is used to compute median returns. DQN with parameter space noise outperforms ES on 15 out of 21 Atari games, demonstrating the combination of desirable exploration properties with sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. Various algorithms have been proposed to address the exploration problem in reinforcement learning. The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning has been extensively studied, with algorithms proposed to guarantee near-optimal solutions in a polynomial number of steps. However, in real-world scenarios with continuous and high-dimensional state and action spaces, these algorithms become impractical. Various techniques have been proposed in deep reinforcement learning to improve exploration, but they are often computationally expensive. Perturbing policy parameters has been shown to outperform other methods in policy gradient algorithms. The authors propose perturbing policy parameters to improve exploration in reinforcement learning, showing better performance than random exploration. Their method is evaluated for both on and off-policy settings, using high-dimensional policies and environments with large state spaces. This approach contrasts with previous work limited to low-dimensional policies and state spaces.

It is evaluated for both on and off-policy settings, using high-dimensional policies and environments with large state spaces. This contrasts with previous work limited to low-dimensional policies and state spaces. Parameter space noise is proposed as a simple yet effective method to improve exploration in reinforcement learning. This approach perturbs network parameters directly, showing superior exploration behavior compared to traditional methods like -greedy and additive Gaussian noise. It can be combined with contemporary on-and off-policy deep RL techniques for efficient exploration. In this work, parameter space noise is proposed as a replacement for traditional action space noise in deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO. It has shown improved performance in solving environments with sparse rewards compared to action noise. Parameter space noise is considered a viable alternative to action space noise in reinforcement learning applications. The study explores parameter space noise as an alternative to action space noise in reinforcement learning. The experimental setup involves a network architecture with convolutional layers and a policy network for parameter space noise. Target networks are updated regularly during training. The study uses ReLUs in each layer and layer normalization in the fully connected part of the network. A second head is included for parameter space noise, updating target networks every 10 K timesteps. The Q-value network is trained with Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 10^-4, and a batch size of 32. The replay buffer holds 1 M state transitions. The policy is perturbed at the start of each episode with adaptively scaled noise. The policy is perturbed at the beginning of each episode with adaptively scaled noise, ensuring a maximum KL divergence between perturbed and non-perturbed \u03c0. The policy head is perturbed after the convolutional part of the network, and -greedy action selection is used to avoid getting stuck. Initial data is collected with 50 K random actions before training starts, and \u03b3 is set to 0.99. To avoid getting stuck, -greedy action selection with = 0.01 is used in the network. Initial data is collected with 50 K random actions before training starts. Observations are down-sampled to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels and converted to grayscale. The network input consists of a concatenation of 4 subsequent frames. The network architecture for DDPG includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units each for both the actor and critic, with layer normalization applied to all layers. The setup for DDPG includes using up to 30 noop actions at the beginning of the episode, a network architecture with 2 hidden layers for both actor and critic, layer normalization, soft-updated target networks, Adam optimizer, L2 penalty regularization, a replay buffer with 100 K state transitions, and parameter space noise scaling. The setup for TRPO involves using a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01, a policy network with 2 hidden layers of 32 tanh units for nonlocomotion tasks, and 2 hidden layers of 64 tanh units for locomotion tasks. The Hessian calculation is subsampled with a factor of 0.1, \u03b3 = 0.99, and a batch size of 5 K timesteps per epoch. The baseline is a learned linear transformation of observations. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01, a policy network with 2 hidden layers for nonlocomotion tasks and 2 hidden layers for locomotion tasks. The Hessian calculation is subsampled with a factor of 0.1, \u03b3 = 0.99, and the batch size per epoch is set to 5 K timesteps. Environments from OpenAI Gym and rllab are used for tasks like Swimmer, Sparse tasks, and SparseDoublePendulum. The curr_chunk discusses different environments like DISPLAYFORM2, DISPLAYFORM3, DISPLAYFORM4, and DISPLAYFORM5, each with specific reward conditions. DQN is used with a simple network structure for approximating the Q-value function. Agents are trained for up to 2K episodes with varying chain lengths N and different seeds for evaluation. The curr_chunk discusses the use of different algorithms like adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a simple and scalable environment to test for exploratory behavior. The agents are trained for up to 2K episodes with varying chain lengths N and different seeds for evaluation. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a simple environment for exploratory behavior testing. The algorithms have specific settings such as the number of heads, masking probabilities, and annealing schedules. The training process includes details on parameter scaling, replay buffer size, target network updates, optimizer choice, and learning rate. The expected return is expanded using likelihood ratios for a stochastic policy. The curr_chunk discusses the use of parameter space noise in training a stochastic policy. It involves setting specific parameters like the scale \u03c3 and adapting the noise method accordingly. This is crucial as the scale can vary with network architecture and learning progress. The curr_chunk introduces a method to adapt the scale of parameter space noise in training a stochastic policy, addressing the challenge of selecting a suitable scale \u03c3 that can vary with network architecture and learning progress. This adaptation involves using a time-varying scale \u03c3k related to action space variance, updated every K timesteps. The method adapts the scale of parameter space noise by using a time-varying scale \u03c3k related to action space variance, updated every K timesteps. The update is based on a heuristic using a distance measure between non-perturbed and perturbed policies, with \u03b1 and \u03b4 as scaling and threshold values. The choice of distance measure depends on the policy representation, with \u03b1 set to 1.01 in experiments. For DQN, the policy is implicitly defined by the Q-value function. In experiments, the choice of distance measure and \u03b4 depends on policy representation. For DQN, a na\u00efve distance measure between Q and Q can lead to pitfalls due to implicit policy definition. A probabilistic formulation is used for both non-perturbed and perturbed policies, applying the softmax function over predicted Q values. The text discusses using a probabilistic formulation for policies in DQN, applying the softmax function over predicted Q values to measure the distance in action space. This approach effectively normalizes Q-values and avoids pitfalls in comparing different policies. The text introduces a method to measure distance in action space using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, effectively normalizing Q-values. This approach allows for fair comparison between greedy and \u03b5-greedy policies without the need for additional hyperparameters. The text discusses using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure distance in action space, allowing for fair comparison between different policies without additional hyperparameters. This method relates noise induced by parameter space perturbations to additive Gaussian noise in DDPG. The text discusses using distance measures between non-perturbed and perturbed policies in action space, adapting noise for TRPO by computing a trust region around the noise direction to ensure policy proximity. The text discusses computing a trust region around the noise direction to ensure policy proximity in TRPO. Learning curves for Atari games and performance comparisons between ES and DQN are provided. Results for InvertedPendulum and InvertedDoublePendulum are noted to be noisy due to small policy changes impacting performance significantly. The performance of TRPO with noise scaled according to the parameter curvature is shown in FIG10. Adaptive parameter space noise achieves stable performance on InvertedDoublePendulum, comparable to other exploration approaches. No noise in action or parameter space achieves similar results, indicating these environments with DDPG are not ideal for exploration testing. Adding parameter space noise improves learning consistency on challenging sparse environments when combined with TRPO. The TRPO baseline uses action noise, while adding parameter space noise helps in learning more consistently."
