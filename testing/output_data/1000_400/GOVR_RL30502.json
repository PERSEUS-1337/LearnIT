President Clinton vetoed H.R. 4516, which funds the operations of Congress and the White House, prioritizing funding for classrooms, schools, and workers.

Federal white-collar employees receive annual adjustments based on the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), federal white collar employees receive annual adjustments based on two mechanisms. The base pay adjustment for January 2001 is 2.7%, with no proposed changes. The second tier adjustment is 1%. Locality-based payments are calculated from surveys. The President did not send an alternative plan to Congress by the end of August, resulting in a 2.7% base pay adjustment. The budget recommendation is for 3.7%, with the assumption that programs are funded to accommodate that rate. Locality-based payments are calculated from surveys of specific localities within the United States, with an average of 16% needed to meet FEPCA expectations. President Clinton later sent a plan to Congress for locality payments equal to 1% of payroll. The Federal Wage System compensates federal blue-collar workers at prevailing local rates. President Clinton sent an alternative plan to Congress on December 1, 2000, proposing locality payments equal to 1% of payroll for the Federal Wage System (FWS). Congress has limited the rates of adjustment for FWS wages based on the General Schedule, with the rationale that some FWS wages could exceed salaries of General Schedule supervisors in high-cost areas. Section 613 of the FY2001 appropriations continues this limitation. Congress has limited the rates of adjustment for FWS wages based on the General Schedule to prevent FWS wages from exceeding salaries of General Schedule supervisors in high-cost areas. Section 613 of the FY2001 appropriations continues this limitation. Pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are based on ECI calculations, but are limited to the rate of adjustment for the General Schedule. Pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are based on ECI calculations for a different 12-month period. The ECI calculations would dictate a pay adjustment in January 2001 of 3%, but the adjustment is limited to the rate of adjustment for the General Schedule. Despite reports that the President vetoed a bill to prevent a pay raise for Members of Congress, the raise would still go into effect as it is automatic unless specifically denied in legislation. The pay raise for Members of Congress in January 2001 would go into effect automatically unless specifically denied in legislation. Unlike for Members of Congress and executive branch officials, judges' pay increase must be authorized, which is done in the Commerce, State, Justice and Judiciary appropriation.

Definitions from the \"Glossary of Budgetary Terms\" are provided in the Manual on the Federal Budget Process. The Manual on the Federal Budget Process defines key budget terms such as Account, Appropriation, Authorization, Budget Authority, and Budget Resolution. Budget Authority allows for obligations leading to outlays, and Budget Resolutions outline congressional budgets for at least five fiscal years. Budget authority is provided by law for obligations resulting in outlays, including appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. A budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by Congress setting forth the budget for at least the next five fiscal years. A continuing resolution provides temporary budget authority to agencies or programs when regular appropriations have not been enacted. A continuing resolution is temporary budget authority for agencies or programs when regular appropriations are not enacted. It can expire on a specified date or be in effect for the remainder of the fiscal year. Direct spending is budget authority provided in laws other than annual appropriations acts, while discretionary spending is provided in annual appropriations acts. Federal funds refer to all monies collected and spent. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is distinguished from discretionary spending and is subject to PAGO rules. Discretionary spending is budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts. Federal funds encompass all government monies except trust funds. Obligations are binding agreements requiring payment, while outlays are payments made to fulfill obligations. PAGO is the Pay-as-You-Go process established by the Budget Enforcement Act. The PAGO process, established by the Budget Enforcement Act, ensures that revenue and direct spending legislation does not add to the deficit or reduce the surplus. It requires any deficit increase or surplus reduction to be offset by other legislation or sequestration. The reconciliation process allows Congress to adjust existing laws to align with budget resolution levels. The PAGO process enforces budgetary effects of new revenue and spending laws. The reconciliation process adjusts laws to match budget resolution levels. Scorekeeping tracks budget actions, and supplemental appropriations provide additional budget authority.
