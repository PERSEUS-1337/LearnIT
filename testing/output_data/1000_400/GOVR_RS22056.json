    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The Act authorizes various Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite the expiration of authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs in FY2001, Congress continues to fund these programs. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes various Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, Congress continues to appropriate funds for the programs. Major changes to IHCIA have been suggested, leading to a series of reauthorization bills in Congress. The 106th-109th Congresses saw the introduction of several bills related to the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). These bills addressed Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP. Congress also faced financial claims against the United States stemming from Indian trust funds mismanagement. The federal government's mismanagement of Indian trust funds has led to financial claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes, totaling as much as $176 billion. This issue has also prompted the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians within the Department of the Interior. Trust lands totaling about 56 million acres and funds with an asset value of $3.3 billion are at the center of the controversy. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manage trust funds, lands, and assets for Indian tribes and individuals. Trust lands total about 56 million acres, with funds totaling $3.3 billion in tribal and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The BIA has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds, with past investigations revealing issues in documenting asset values and linking lands to owners. Congress enacted the American Indian Trust Fund in response to these challenges. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds. In response, the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted to address these issues. This led to the creation of the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. Subsequently, a class action suit was filed by IIM account holders demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. The 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act led to the creation of the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. A class action suit was filed by IIM account holders demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. This resulted in the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and OST, with congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims for trust fund and lands mismanagement. In the first stage of the Cobell case, the district court found that the Department of the Interior (DOI) and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and trust management systems. In the Cobell case, the district court found that DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and trust management systems. The court ordered trust management to be brought up to current standards, with the final stage determining the amount owed to IIM plaintiffs. DOI proposed a method for reconciling trust account transactions, while the plaintiffs suggested using databases to estimate the total amount due. The district court ordered DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887 without using statistical sampling. DOI estimated compliance would cost $12-13 billion, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the district court's order. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court's order for the DOI to conduct a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887. The DOI estimated compliance would cost $12-13 billion. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts, rejecting the need for a large-scale historical accounting as ordered by the district court in 1994. No bills have been introduced to amend the 1994 Act. The House Appropriations Committee and the conference committee rejected the need for a large-scale historical accounting as ordered by the district court in 1994. Congress is concerned about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation and other Indian programs. Current costs include ongoing litigation expenses, with potential future costs estimated at $12-$13 billion for the court-ordered historical accounting and a possible Cobell settlement. Possible future costs for the Cobell lawsuit include $12-$13 billion for court-ordered historical accounting, a potential settlement amount of $27.5 billion proposed by Cobell plaintiffs, and an estimated $100 billion owed to IIM accounts. Funding sources may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" but some consider the Fund insufficient for a settlement. Congress may consider various options such as further court actions, delaying accounting, defining DOI's obligations, or directing a settlement. Two settlement bills, S. 1439, have been proposed. The Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund\" may not be enough for a $12-$13 billion settlement for the Cobell lawsuit. Congress is considering options like awaiting court actions, delaying accounting, defining DOI's obligations, or directing a settlement. Two bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, have been introduced in Congress to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund and make various changes in Indian trust asset management. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 to establish a commission for Indian trust asset management, increase payments for individual Indian trust interests, and require an annual audit of all Indian trust funds. H.R. 4322 is pending further committee action, while a settlement amount of $8 billion for S. 1439 was withdrawn before mark-up. The Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 in 2005 and 2006. A settlement amount of $8 billion for S. 1439 was withdrawn for further negotiations. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made organizational changes since the 1994 Act, including transferring trust fund management from BIA to OST in 1996. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made administrative changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act. In 1996, trust fund management was transferred from BIA to OST, while trust lands and physical assets remained with BIA. A new reorganization in April 2003 split BIA trust management operations from other services, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear new OST duties.

A recent reorganization split BIA trust management from other services, creating OST field operations. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear new OST duties. Bills proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management have not advanced in Congress. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose to reorganize DOI management. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets, with negotiations pending. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, aiming for tribal economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for specific circumstances. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands for tribal economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for specific circumstances, which critics argue may lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development intended by Congress. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to curb exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that allow \"reservation shopping\" for gaming off-reservation. These bills remove the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed. They also retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes with certain limitations. The bills H.R. 4893 and S. 2078 aim to address off-reservation gaming issues by removing certain exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation for tribal lands, while both bills retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes with limitations. H.R. 4893 repeals the land claim exception and adds a new one for landless tribes, but opponents argue that these changes impose unfair burdens on certain tribes. The bills H.R. 4893 and S. 2078 aim to address off-reservation gaming issues by removing certain exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation for tribal lands, while opponents argue that these changes impose unfair burdens on certain tribes, including newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. Native Hawaiians, not currently considered Indians under federal law, have no recognized political entity by the federal government. Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawaii, lack federal recognition as Indians and do not have a recognized political entity. This absence poses challenges for federal and state programs benefiting Native Hawaiians, which are currently facing legal challenges as being race-based. Congressional action is required to establish a recognized Native Hawaiian political entity, as they are excluded from the DOI's administrative process. Three bills in the 109th Congress aim to address this issue. Three bills in the 109th Congress, S. 147, H.R. 309, and S. 3064, aim to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity. This entity would be organized and federally recognized, but questions about its governmental powers and lands are left for later negotiations. The bills exclude the Native Hawaiian political entity from BIA programs and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Arguments for and against the bills are summarized. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous peoples in the United States. They point to the special relationship Congress has with Native Hawaiians, citing established programs like the Hawaiian homelands program. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians, like Indian tribes, have a distinct community with cultural and political institutions, maintaining claims to sovereignty despite the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity. Opponents dispute the U.S. government's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, arguing that it is not within Congress's constitutional authority and that the U.S. does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does for Indian tribes. They also contend that recognition of a Native Hawaiian entity would be based on race alone, without meeting criteria like geography and community. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it is not within Congress's constitutional authority and that the U.S. does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does for Indian tribes. They also claim that the recognition would be based on race alone, setting a precedent for other non-Indian groups. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission has raised concerns about racial discrimination regarding this issue. Additionally, some opponents dispute claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, stating that it ended before 1893. On May 5, 2006, a briefing report opposed the passage of S. 147 due to racial discrimination concerns. Some opponents disputed claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, arguing that it ended before 1893. S. 147 and H.R. 309 were extensively considered in previous Congresses, with S. 147 failing to proceed in the Senate on June 8, 2006. S. 3064, an amended version of S. 147, was discussed among congressional offices, the Administration, and the state of Hawaii. The Senate failed to proceed with S. 147 and S. 3064 on June 8, 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309 on July 19, 2005."
