    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but international civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly seen as more suitable for maintaining law and order in post-conflict environments. International civilian police (CivPol) have become increasingly recognized as more suited than military forces for maintaining law and order in post-conflict environments. Policymakers have acknowledged issues with their use and are working on improvements. Congress is currently considering whether to support these enhancements. The importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations, including civil police forces, in promoting stability in post-conflict situations is recognized. Policymakers are addressing issues with their use and considering improvements. Congress is debating whether to support enhancements to the existing system and build new CivPol capabilities. Proposals include facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel and ensuring appropriate training for handling law enforcement situations. Reforms to the existing system are also being considered. Proposals aim to enhance peacekeeping operations by improving recruitment and training of law enforcement personnel. Key documents, such as PDD-71 and UN recommendations, suggest reforms to existing CivPol systems. The Clinton Administration's directive was not fully implemented, but the Bush Administration has started taking measures. The Bush Administration has begun implementing measures outlined in PDD-71 and the UN's Brahimi Panel report to address issues in peacekeeping operations, including recruitment, training, and deployment of international civilian police personnel. Proposed reforms include creating a reserve CivPol force. The United Nations is implementing reforms in peacekeeping operations, including creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces, and establishing robust civilian response mechanisms. The report discusses the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, focusing on the need for more robust civilian response mechanisms to reduce reliance on military forces in post-conflict operations. It also highlights the challenges faced in implementing these mechanisms. The report provides a brief overview of the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, including the challenges encountered. It discusses current mechanisms for providing CivPols to international operations, recommendations for improvement, and options for resolving ongoing issues. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for such operations. The report discusses the increasing use of CivPols in international peace operations, with a significant rise in the number of international civilian police participating in U.N. operations. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 international civilian police, including 476 Americans, were assisting with law enforcement tasks in U.N. peacekeeping missions. The number of currently deployed UNCIVPOLs has doubled in the past ten years, with 4,655 international civilian police, including 476 Americans, assisting in U.N. peacekeeping missions as of February 29, 2004. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. Five UNCIVPOL were deployed to Afghanistan as of the same date. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is conducted under Section 660. As of February 29, 2004, five UNCIVPOL were deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with exceptions for post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been utilized for various purposes since the late 19th century, including monitoring local forces, conducting joint patrols, training, advising, and assisting with restructuring. Assistance in post-conflict situations is provided on a case-by-case basis, as there is no specific statutory authority to regulate and fund such aid. International civilian police forces, with recruits from multiple nations, have been used to monitor and supervise local forces, conduct joint patrols, train and advise, and assist with restructuring. They follow the SMART acronym for functions and have evolved through five phases to establish security in peacekeeping operations. During the past decade, policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases, expanding U.N. activities from monitoring mandates to training components and substantial reform efforts. Operations do not need to be modeled after the latest ones. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including the addition of training components, reform efforts, specially constituted constabulary units, and the expansion of mandates to provide international police with executive authority. This evolution began in Cambodia, intensified in El Salvador, and continued in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, East Timor, and Kosovo. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has expanded mandates to provide international police with executive authority, including the ability to bear arms and make arrests. This evolution reflects the international community's awareness of security needs and the responsibility of countries and organizations involved in interventions. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has expanded mandates to provide international police with executive authority, including the ability to bear arms and make arrests. Policymakers and analysts have identified gaps in implementing peacekeeping mandates, focusing on the need for clear mandates and standards for effective implementation to ensure public security. The first problem area identified in improving peacekeeping mechanisms is a system gap related to recruitment and training deficiencies, particularly within the United Nations due to diverse policing standards among volunteer countries. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen from diverse countries with varying policing standards. Despite efforts to weed out unsuitable candidates, there are still issues in finding personnel with necessary skills for complex missions. Analysts suggest additional training to establish common policing skills for all missions. The United Nations has adopted procedures to recruit personnel with necessary skills for complex missions, but challenges remain in finding well-trained individuals. Analysts recommend additional training to establish common policing skills for all missions and enhance collaboration. Security gaps exist in establishing law and order in post-conflict situations, exacerbated by deficiencies in recruitment and training systems. Security gaps can be troublesome in post-conflict situations where parties are not dedicated to peace or criminal networks are present. The deployment gap, seen in missions like the U.S. intervention in Panama and Cambodia, highlights the challenge of deploying police forces quickly and in sufficient numbers. In Somalia, delays in deploying CivPol components hindered mission tasks. The deployment gap in international missions, such as in Panama, Cambodia, Somalia, and Bosnia, has hindered the ability to quickly deploy an adequate number of police forces with specialized skills. This enforcement gap poses challenges in ensuring the necessary level of security in post-conflict situations. The deployment time for international missions has been somewhat reduced, but it is still not optimal. There is a gap in the U.N.'s ability to deploy enough people with specialized skills, leading to an enforcement gap where deployed police forces lack necessary skills for handling hostile situations and organized crime. This has been evident in past missions like Somalia in 1993-1995 and Bosnia in 1996. In post-conflict situations, peacekeeping operations can be compromised due to various gaps. One such gap is the institution gap, where indigenous law enforcement systems lack adequate personnel and resources for effective prosecution and punishment. This leads to challenges in handling increased workloads and ensuring sustainable security. In post-conflict situations, judicial and penal institutions often lack resources and personnel to effectively prosecute and punish, hindering sustainable security. International police assistance has been provided by the United Nations, European countries, regional organizations, and the United States. The United Nations international civilian police system is a key mechanism for providing assistance in multilateral operations, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers as of February 29, 2004. The United Nations international civilian police system, along with European countries, regional organizations, and the United States, play important roles in international police operations. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions, with Jordan being the largest contributor followed by the United States. Kosovo had the largest UNCIVPOL mission, with over 75% of officers serving there. Other countries contributing over 100 officers include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions. Kosovo had the largest UNCIVPOL mission, with over 75% of officers serving there. Other missions are in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. The United States provided police assistance in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority in the early to mid-1990s. During the early to mid-1990s, the United States provided police assistance in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority. Many European Union member states, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, and Italy, have also contributed police assistance individually. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union have taken the lead in specific missions, often in conjunction with U.N. missions. The OSCE and EU have taken the lead in police missions in various countries, including Kosovo and Bosnia. The EU launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2003. U.N. Member States contribute police assistance. The EU took over police missions in Bosnia from the UN in 2003 and launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The Charter-driven principles of peacekeeping governing civilian police include consent, cooperation, impartiality, and minimal use of force. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides political and executive direction to all components of the operation in the field, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division is responsible for policy, planning, and management of civilian policing activities within the mission. The U.N. Security Council oversees the operation in the field, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division manages civilian policing activities and personnel recruitment. UNCIVPOL personnel report to the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner in the field. The Brahimi Panel report addresses problems in U.N. peacekeeping. The Brahimi Panel report is the authoritative analysis of problems in U.N. peacekeeping, focusing on recruitment and training of police personnel and deployment challenges. It recommended actions to enhance the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of UNCIVPOLs. The Brahimi Panel report recommended actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of UNCIVPOLs, including establishing ready rosters of qualified CivPols, developing on-call lists for mission planning, forming regional partnerships for joint police training, and appointing national points of contact on CivPol matters. Additionally, conferences were held to address recruitment and training issues in U.N. policing operations. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address problems with U.N. policing operations, reaching near consensus on proposals for recruitment, training, and deployment. Recommendations included incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system and pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment. Other recommendations focused on procedural and organizational impediments to efficient operations. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address problems with U.N. policing operations. Recommendations included incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system and pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment. Some Brahimi panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations have been implemented, but significant problems remain with the UNCIVPOL system. Constraints on UNCIVPOL reform in recruitment, training, and deployment areas are also discussed. The Brahimi Panel report recommended reforms to address problems in recruitment, training, and deployment of UN police operations. Progress has been made in reforming the management of UN peacekeeping operations. The recommendations aimed to improve the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL operations by enhancing the qualifications and training of law enforcement personnel. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing reform and restructuring over monitoring and training activities. This shift required law enforcement personnel to work closely with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This approach may strain U.N. Member States by necessitating more specialized police experts. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing the integration of law enforcement personnel with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This shift may strain U.N. Member States by requiring more specialized police experts and faces challenges within the U.N. CivPol system. The UNDPKO and CPD perspective is that UNCIVPOL personnel's primary role is to build local police services capacity. The UN has created a new rule of law unit, but progress in integrating rule of law components is viewed as \"lagging\" by the Henry L. Stimson Center. The UNDPKO received only two of the six posts requested for planning rule of law operations, hindering their ability to deploy missions with a substantial criminal justice component. The UNDPKO is facing challenges in integrating rule of law components, with only two out of six requested posts received for planning operations. This hinders their ability to deploy missions with a substantial criminal justice component. The recruitment system for civilian police from various UN Member nations also faces issues in meeting minimum standards and lacking experience. The current ad hoc system of recruiting civilian police from various UN Member nations presents three main problems: uneven results in meeting minimum standards and lack of experience in community policing and human rights, difficulties in recruiting officers with specialized skills, and the absence of a comprehensive UN civilian police strategy. The absence of a comprehensive U.N. civilian police strategy has made it difficult to recruit officers with specialized skills for missions. The current criteria for civilian police include a minimum age of 25, five years of service in a national police force with community policing experience, and proficiency in one of the official U.N. languages. The United Nations requires Member States to provide officers for UNCIVPOL missions who meet basic criteria, including a minimum age of 25, five years of service in a national police force with community policing experience, proficiency in an official U.N. language, possession of a driver's license, ability to operate a four-wheel drive vehicle, and meeting medical standards. Some civilian police personnel may not meet all criteria, especially in language, driving, and firearms skills, despite U.N. efforts to improve recruit quality. Since 1996, the United Nations has sent Selection Assistance Teams (SATs) to guide Member States in selecting police candidates for missions. Despite U.N. efforts to improve recruit quality, some civilian police personnel still lack basic language, driving, and firearms skills. Retraining and retesting of these requirements continue in the mission upon arrival, with high repatriation costs previously incurred due to these deficiencies. Some civilian police personnel lack basic language, driving, and firearms skills, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills is challenging, with better success in recruiting for general skills than for specialists in areas such as training, investigations, and organized crime. Specialists are often recruited from within missions after personnel arrive. Recommendations include advance recruitment of personnel before missions. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations emphasize the importance of advance recruitment of specialized personnel for missions to improve quality and speed deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report suggests establishing national \"ready rosters\" of trained CivPol personnel under the UNSAS for quick deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report and UNDPKO seminar recommendations suggest creating national \"ready rosters\" of trained CivPol personnel under the UNSAS for quick deployment. The UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations acknowledged progress in strengthening UNSAS. The creation of an effective ready roster of international police personnel is essential for peacekeeping operations. Progress has been made in strengthening UNSAS, but there is a need for more participating countries and specialized personnel. Recommendations include creating national pools of candidates with professional experience and familiarity with UN rules. The report recommended creating national pools of candidates with professional experience for international operations, replacing 'bidding for slots' with real candidates familiar with UN rules. The Brahimi Panel Report also called for an on-call list of 100 police officers for advance mission planning. UNDPKO established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel for new missions. 10 of the 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the on-call lists. The UNDPKO established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel for new missions. 10 of the 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the on-call lists. The United Nations has made efforts to improve recruitment for specialists by including substantive skills in the selection criteria since spring 2003. These skills include management, planning, training, mentoring, criminal investigations, forensic analysis, and traffic control. Since spring 2003, SAT visits now consider substantive skills like management, planning, training, mentoring, criminal investigations, forensic analysis, and traffic control. Analysts have noted flaws in U.N. procedures affecting recruitment efforts, highlighted by a 2001 audit criticizing the lack of standardized criteria for civilian police deployment in missions like UNMIBH and UNMIK. The audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills to specific missions, leading to civilian police personnel performing non-policing functions. A significant percentage of civilian police in missions like UNMIBH, UNMIK, and UNTAET were assigned to administrative functions at mission headquarters. Administrative tasks accounted for eight percent of the total. Nearly 18 percent of civilian police in UNMIBH, UNMIK, and UNTAET were assigned to administrative functions at mission headquarters, accounting for eight percent of the total number of police officers. Mission-preparedness training varies among police-contributing Member States and can undermine the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions due to lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training. The police component of a mission may comprise officers from up to 40 countries who have never met before, as highlighted in a 2003 report by the U.N. Secretary-General. The lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training can undermine the effectiveness of a UNCIVPOL mission. Member States provide pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel, with in-theater training covering standard operating procedures, safety, security, human rights, computer, and local language training. Experts cite three main reasons for inadequate training. UNCIVPOL personnel receive pre-deployment training in standard operating procedures, safety, security, human rights, computer, and local language. Challenges in training include lack of experienced trainers, resources, and varying national programs. Recommendations include developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises in line with U.N. procedures. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommendations focus on improving police training programs for rapid deployment. They suggest developing regional partnerships for joint training exercises and using U.N. educational materials to pre-train personnel. The Stimson Center notes limited progress in this area, except for the European Union. The UNDPKO Training Unit has distributed training publications to assist Member States with pre-deployment training. The UNDPKO Training Unit has made efforts to improve pre-deployment training by developing training publications and common training standards for peacekeepers. The United States aims to contribute to enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations through training. UNDPKO has developed common training standards, including \"generic training modules\" for peacekeepers. PDD-71 recognized the need for international organizations to supplement national training and called for tailored training packages for CIVPOL from the State Department's INL office. The State Department's INL office is called upon to provide tailored training packages for CIVPOL when requested by organizing bodies or contributing states. A new CivPol program aims to allow foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent, although specific arrangements are still being determined. Deployment of UNCIVPOL involves defining mission needs and rapidly recruiting qualified personnel. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs, recruiting qualified personnel, and coordinating contributions from multiple nations. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays and recommendations were made to address them. Foreign police officers may train with the U.S. contingent as part of a new CivPol program. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays in UNCIVPOL missions, including the lack of a standing police force and insufficient resources. Recommendations were made to address these issues, such as establishing a reserve corps of mission leadership and improving standby arrangements for equipment. The report recommended deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies after Security Council authorization. The Brahimi Panel report recommended full deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies after a Security Council mandate. However, there are constraints on rapid deployment, including the UN system's capacity, civilian standby arrangements, and the need for contributing states to act quickly. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations highlighted constraints on rapid deployment, including the UN system's limited capacity for concurrent missions, civilian standby arrangements lacking region-specific expertise, and the need for contributing states to quickly deploy trained civilian police personnel. Reforms are underway to improve the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements and develop a 100-person roster for rapid deployment of civilian police personnel. Additionally, equipment will be pre-packaged and stored at the UN Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy for quicker deployment. The United Nations is reforming its Standby Arrangements to deploy more rapidly in the future. Equipment will be pre-packaged and stored in Italy for quick deployment. However, there is no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many U.N. Member States have generic rapid deployment programs but lack the capability to deploy rapidly. The United Nations is reforming its Standby Arrangements to deploy more rapidly in the future. Many U.N. Member States have generic rapid deployment programs but lack the capability to deploy rapidly. The U.S. CivPol program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which recruits civilian police personnel on a case-by-case basis for each mission through a commercial contractor. The State Department recruits civilian police personnel from local law enforcement agencies through commercial contractors for police operations. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of personnel, but new arrangements with other companies have been initiated to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deployment. The U.S. CivPol program recruits civilian police personnel through commercial contractors to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deployment. The program is funded through various State Department regional bureaus and officers receive a base salary ranging from $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through State Department regional bureaus and officers receive a base salary ranging from $50,000-100,000. Those in U.N. missions get a subsistence allowance of $75-95 per day, and may receive danger pay. Costs per officer vary by mission, with recent annual costs ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq, covering salary, equipment, transportation, and support services. The private contractor provides police services in Kosovo and Iraq, with costs including officer salaries, equipment, transportation, and support services. The United Nations covers expenses in Kosovo, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the incremental cost per troop in Iraq. The cost of deploying soldiers to Iraq in 2003 ranged from $179,000 to $206,000 based on rotation schedules. U.S. CivPol personnel were participating in international missions in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Iraq as of March 27, 2004. The United States deployed police officers to various international missions in countries like Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Additionally, U.S. policymakers recognized challenges in recruiting qualified CivPol personnel and implemented reforms outlined in PDD-71 to enhance response capacities and operational activities. The U.S. recognized challenges in recruiting qualified CivPol personnel and implemented reforms outlined in PDD-71 to enhance response capacities and operational activities, including improving recruitment, training, management, and deployment of CivPol personnel. Problems with U.S. CivPol contingents are similar to those in the U.N. civilian police system, including inefficiency in matching skills with mission requirements, inconsistencies in training and professionalism levels, and delays in deployment. Analysts emphasize the need for continued improvement in the current system. The U.S. CivPol system faces challenges in recruiting qualified personnel and implementing reforms outlined in PDD-71. Analysts emphasize the need for continued improvement, despite positive perceptions in recent years. The Department of State has issued contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for rapid deployment in international police service. The State Department has issued contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for rapid deployment in international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services to facilitate the rapid deployment of well-qualified CivPols. The new cadre of U.S. civilian police aims to eliminate the need for conducting recruitment, selection, and training activities from scratch for international CivPol operations. The State Department has awarded contracts to establish a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for rapid deployment in international police service. The contractor will also identify technical advisors to assist with establishing institutional capabilities in police, judicial, and corrections systems. Concerns have been raised about the expeditiousness of the process due to awarding contracts to multiple companies instead of one as originally planned. Some analysts fear that the advantages of continued competition for CivPol deployments may be offset by additional costs and delays. The extent to which the original RFP provisions apply to the new contracts is unclear as they have not been made public. Recruitment methods for CivPols have been a topic of debate among experts. DynCorp and other companies recruit police officers for international missions. Experts have debated the recruitment program for providing CivPols to U.N. police missions and dispatching them to Iraq. DynCorp and other companies recruit police officers from state and local law enforcement agencies, leading to staffing issues in municipal and state departments due to call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces. In recent years, staffing issues in municipal and state police departments have been worsened by call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces for various missions. Some analysts suggest providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing police officers to CivPol missions to recruit a more professional and qualified force. Some suggest compensating state and municipal governments for detailing police officers to CivPol missions to recruit a more professional force. There are concerns about the lack of financial incentives for officers participating in international police service and the impact of recruiting individual U.S. police officers instead of formed police units. Some analysts criticize the U.S. selection criteria for civilian police candidates in international missions, citing lack of cohesion and relevance to mission requirements. Criteria include U.S. citizenship, work experience as a sworn law enforcement officer, unblemished record, valid driver's license, physical and psychological fitness, English proficiency, and handgun qualification. Despite concerns, the Department of State meets recruitment goals for basic skills. The Department of State requires candidates to have a valid U.S. passport, ability to drive a standard transmission 4x4 vehicle, excellent health, pass physical, agility, and psychological tests, and communicate in English. Additionally, candidates must qualify with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. Recruitment goals for basic skills are being met, and efforts are being made to recruit specialized personnel for missions in Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. The State Department CivPol cadre program aims to address the need for high-quality and specialized personnel by including nearly 55% specialists in the total cadre. The State Department's CivPol cadre program aims to recruit high-quality personnel, with nearly 55% being specialists. Selected individuals must possess specific skills and experience, and will receive annual training in essential policing skills. This training is intended to incentivize officers to join the program by offering opportunities for promotion. The State Department's CivPol cadre program aims to recruit high-quality personnel with specific skills and experience. Officers will receive annual training in essential policing skills to incentivize career growth. Funding for training all members of the program is uncertain due to varying levels of skills among recruited officers. The new program's maintenance for potentially 6,000 people is unclear. Training for U.S. CivPols is complicated by varying skills among recruited officers. The current pre-deployment training includes UN operations, ICITAP, mission overview, civil-military relations, and team building. The pre-deployment training curriculum for U.S. CivPols includes United Nations operations, ICITAP, mission overview, civil-military relations, team building, lifestyle in the mission, human rights, logistical support, personal safety, defensive tactics, and use of police equipment. The new training program aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The new State Department CivPol cadre program aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The training curriculum includes courses in policing skills, specialized training, and ongoing in-service training. The program also seeks recognition and certification from U.S. and select foreign law enforcement organizations. Training costs may be higher than anticipated due to increased annual trainees and facilities for pre-deployment training. The new CivPol cadre program includes additional annual training for police officers. Concerns have been raised about potential higher training costs under the new system. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days, falling short of the proposed legislation's deployment capability timeline of 15 days. Maintaining current deployment capabilities is uncertain. The new CivPol cadre program includes additional annual training for police officers. Concerns have been raised about potential higher training costs under the new system. The deployment capability for UNCIVPOL falls short of expectations in proposed legislation, with questions raised about maintaining current deployment capability under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and develop a logistics support team to decrease deployment time and provide advanced support for the U.S. police contingent. The contractor would develop a logistics support team to provide advanced logistical and administrative support for the U.S. police contingent in international CivPol operations. Deployment time could be decreased with a standby arrangement for equipment. Deployment may be slowed by the need for new bidding with each mission. European countries typically deploy police from their national forces to CivPol operations. European countries deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations, with the exception of the United Kingdom. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has developed goals to enhance the quality and timeliness of European contributions to police missions. Member States agreed to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force at the Feira European Council meeting in 2000. The EU has developed goals to improve European contributions to international police missions, including a plan to establish a 5,000 civilian reserve police force by 2003. This initiative is part of the European Security and Defense Policy adopted in 1999. The EU established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) to provide funding for civilian crisis management operations. Member States have committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Member States also committed to providing up to 13 rapidly deployable, integrated police units. The EU Member States have committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. They also pledged to provide up to 13 rapidly deployable, integrated police units. In November 2003, personnel from 22 European countries tested the interoperability of integrated police units at the headquarters level in Italy. The EU launched its first ESDP mission on January 1, 2003, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU launched its first ESDP mission on January 1, 2003 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, aiming to establish sustainable policing arrangements in accordance with European and international best practices. The mission consists of 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states, with an annual budget of US $47.2 million. Additionally, on December 15, 2003, the EU began its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with an authorized strength of 200 police and civilian personnel and a first-year budget of US $18.6 million. The EU's second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia started on December 15, 2003, with a budget of US $18.6 million. All EU Member States, except Portugal, are participating in the mission. Analysts are skeptical about the EU's crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities improving significantly due to potential issues with national sovereignty surrender. The EU's crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities may not substantially improve due to concerns about EU Member States surrendering national sovereignty for foreign policy coordination. The OSCE has enhanced its operational capabilities, including rapid deployment of CivPols and civilian experts in various countries. The Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT) program was created at the Istanbul Summit in 1999 to facilitate rapid assistance. The Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT) program was established at the Istanbul Summit in 1999 by the OSCE to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions in eight countries. Policing activities focus on training, reform, and development of local police, with an emphasis on promoting security through various areas such as human rights and rule of law. The REACT program, established by the OSCE in 1999, focuses on deploying civilian experts in conflict prevention and post-conflict missions. It aims to promote security through various areas such as human rights, rule of law, and economic stabilization. Participating States can establish their own database of qualified experts for deployment within two to eight weeks. The program has been implemented and improved by the OSCE and its 55 participating States, including the United States and Canada. National websites are created to recruit personnel for the program. The OSCE and its participating States have implemented the REACT program since 2001, focusing on deploying civilian experts in conflict prevention and post-conflict missions. National websites are used to recruit personnel, and a framework of standards has been developed to identify required skills. Some States have provided numerical commitments in specific fields of expertise, and a staffing matrix assists in recruiting. The OSCE has developed a framework of standards for required skills in its activities and uses a staffing matrix to assist in recruiting qualified candidates. The organization recruits CivPols through REACT for advising, mentoring, and development functions. General minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a recognized police training school, active police experience, English communication skills, negotiation abilities, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations. The OSCE recruits CivPols with specific skills such as graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication, negotiation, mapping, and first aid skills. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations. The organization also recruits law enforcement administrators with 8-20 years of experience in law enforcement and police management. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions. In the 108th Congress, Members introduced three bills to enhance U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions. H.R. 1414 aims to improve UNCIVPOL capabilities, H.R. 2616 addresses issues with U.S. CivPol capabilities and proposes creating NATO capabilities for post-conflict stabilization, and S. 2127 seeks to enhance the U.S.'s ability to respond to crises abroad. Analysts suggest options to improve training, constabulary functions, and law enforcement institutions. H.R. 1414 proposes reforming the U.N. civilian police system to enhance capabilities for rapid deployment and effectiveness. It suggests creating a professional United Nations civilian police corps and addressing recruitment and training issues. The bill proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more effective and rapidly deployable. It suggests creating a professional United Nations civilian police corps and addressing recruitment and training issues. The bill proposes the creation of a professional United Nations civilian police corps that should be available for rapid deployment to peace operations within 15 days of a U.N. Security Council authorization. It should be composed of law enforcement professionals trained and equipped for civilian policing functions, with appropriate resources including funding, equipment, training, logistical support, and staffing. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps with appropriate resources and staff, including corrections and judicial law enforcement professionals. It aims to address deployment and enforcement gaps in police missions and improve the current system by setting standards and training programs for international civilian police. Proponents of H.R. 1414 see it as a solution to deployment and enforcement gaps in using UNCIVPOL personnel for police missions. The bill aims to create a professional U.N. police corps to enhance security quickly and efficiently, reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks, and improve the standards and accountability of UNCIVPOL personnel. The findings suggest that creating a professional U.N. police corps would reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks, raise standards and skill levels of personnel, and improve accountability. Opponents are concerned about the cost and sustainability of establishing a standing corps. The establishment of a standing U.N. police corps could increase assessed contributions to cover costs, but concerns exist about sustainability, management capacity, and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616 aims to enhance U.S. and NATO capabilities for reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, aims to improve U.S. and NATO capabilities for reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations by proposing the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security and training overseas. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security and training in post-conflict situations. This reserve would serve as an interim police force overseas and train indigenous civilian police forces. Additionally, there is a proposal for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services in post-conflict scenarios. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security and training in post-conflict situations. Congress calls for a task force to develop the reserve and a new NATO mechanism for military and policing services in post-conflict scenarios. NATO units would be trained and equipped to provide security, with a focus on constabulary skills and controlling belligerent groups and crowds. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes a U.S. civilian police reserve to support post-conflict security. The bill authorizes the President to deploy personnel with constabulary skills for tasks like controlling belligerent groups and supporting police investigations. Proponents believe this reserve would enhance international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction. The proposed legislation aims to establish a U.S. civilian police reserve to support post-conflict security and reconstruction efforts. Proponents argue that this reserve would help bridge deployment gaps and expedite the deployment of civilian police officers. There is a debate between establishing a civilian police reserve in line with the State Department's private sector model or creating a new U.S. government reserve force. Commercial contractors are favored for their quick response capabilities in the private contractor model. Proponents of the private contractor model argue that it is preferable for establishing a U.S. civilian police reserve due to quick response capabilities and avoiding new government bureaucracies. However, opponents raise concerns about the dedication and reliability of commercial contractors in policing operations. Some suggest that a federal agency could deploy a reserve CivPol force as efficiently as a private contractor. Opponents of a government-sponsored reserve for policing operations argue that commercial contractors may lack dedication and reliability in handling unexpected changes and risks. They suggest that a federal agency could deploy a reserve CivPol force efficiently, but at a potentially prohibitive cost. Proponents of a government-created model believe it would symbolize U.S. commitment better, be more responsive to policy, and ensure a more cohesive and accountable force with better quality recruits. Proponents of a government reserve argue that it would symbolize U.S. commitment better, be more responsive to policy, ensure a cohesive and accountable force with quality recruits, and facilitate easier recruitment from local and state police departments. The desirability of pre-deployment training could influence judgments on a government-sponsored vs. a government-contracted reserve force. Training together like U.S. military reservists and coordinating with military forces could make a government-created reserve more effective. NATO constabulary capability could bridge enforcement gaps by providing necessary skills through NATO. A NATO constabulary capability could potentially be more effective and reliable than the current ad hoc model, bridging enforcement gaps in post-conflict situations. However, concerns exist about NATO's suitability for policing functions and the potential duplication of structures within the European Union. Some critics argue that creating a reserve military force for policing functions within NATO may duplicate existing European Union structures and strain U.S.-European relations. Analysts suggest additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination to avoid delays in deployment and ensure standardized policing styles. Some argue that creating U.S. or international police reserves without standardized training could perpetuate policing style differences, leading to operational challenges. Critics question the need for such forces and the commitment of U.S. police officers to them, fearing resource strain and tensions with local governments. (S. 2127: Strengthening Civilian Rule of Law and Other Capabilities, February 25, 2004) The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) was introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden to reorganize government structures for civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond effectively to overseas crises. The bill would provide $80 million to hire personnel from the State Department and USAID for this purpose. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) aims to strengthen the capacity of civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond to overseas crises by providing $80 million to hire personnel from the State Department and USAID for a Response Readiness Corps. This Corps would be trained specifically for missions, with a requirement for 10% of personnel to be identified and trained within three years of enactment. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 aims to strengthen civilian foreign affairs agencies by providing funding to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps. This Corps would be trained for missions, with a requirement for 10% of State Department and USAID personnel to be trained within three years. The bill aims to improve training and professionalization of CivPol personnel to enhance their effectiveness. The need for improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel is emphasized to bridge the deployment gap. Training adjustments in missions like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor were made on a case-by-case basis, highlighting the importance of tailored training packages proposed by PDD-71. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity for tailored training packages for CivPol personnel, with some analysts recommending increased funding for police training. The State Department's new CivPol cadre bid solicitation included a provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, but no decision has been made on the program's content or arrangements. The State Department's new CivPol cadre bid solicitation proposal includes a provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, but no decision has been made on the program's content or arrangements. Increasing international capability for constabulary forces is also suggested as a way to address deployment and enforcement gaps. This includes strengthening existing capabilities in some nations and creating new ones in others. Constabulary police perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement. They regulate movements for safety, intervene in civil violence, deter looting and riots, and disperse violent demonstrations. Trained in military and policing skills, they use a combination to carry out their duties. (H.R. 2616 proposes incorporating a constabulary unit within NATO.) Constabulary forces are essential for handling hostile situations like lynchings, looting, riots, and civil disturbances. They are trained in military and policing skills, making them valuable in post-conflict areas. Equipped with their own support, they can deploy rapidly as formed units. Analysts suggest establishing specialized paramilitary units for peacekeeping missions. Constabulary forces, like the Italian carabinieri and French gendarmerie, are crucial for handling hostile situations in post-conflict areas. These specialized paramilitary units can deploy rapidly as formed units, but their resources can be strained by high deployment rates in numerous peacekeeping operations. Some analysts suggest developing a U.S. army active duty constabulary force to support military police in peacekeeping operations due to high deployment rates straining resources. Army leaders have been hesitant to restructure for peacekeeping missions, arguing it weakens the military force. Some Army analysts and policymakers are considering restructuring the U.S. army to enhance peacekeeping capabilities, despite resistance from Army leaders who prioritize warfighting missions. The value of adaptable forces capable of handling various conflict environments is being debated. Some Army analysts and policymakers are considering restructuring the U.S. army to enhance peacekeeping capabilities by utilizing constabulary forces as an intermediary security force for peace operations. This approach aims to reduce reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities and shorten their withdrawal time from post-conflict situations. Despite potential advantages, analysts are uncertain if other countries would be willing to augment their constabulary capabilities. Some analysts propose developing rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel to address the institution gap in peace operations. Concerns exist about whether other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities or develop them for deployment abroad. Like the United States, countries are increasingly focused on meeting domestic needs. Some analysts suggest creating rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel to address the institution gap in peace operations. The United States currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts. The State Department's new CivPol cadre program aims to create a capability within CivPol to deploy such personnel. The United States currently deploys personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems through Department of Justice contracts, funded by the State Department's INL CivPol program. Analysts believe the current system does not provide necessary personnel in a timely manner. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor to the Rule of Law Program at the United States Institute for Peace, proposes integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" for intervention forces. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor to the Rule of Law Program at the United States Institute for Peace, proposes integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" that includes robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. This approach aims to close security gaps and prevent impunity in post-conflict situations by deploying all elements concurrently. Perito proposes a U.S. stability force consisting of military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. These forces would deploy concurrently to provide security from the outset and bridge deployment gaps. Military shifts to perimeter security after combat, while constabulary units handle internal security. Perito's model proposes a transition from military to civilian control for security and law enforcement functions after major combat operations. Civilian constabulary units and police work alongside military forces to maintain public safety and restore the rule of law. The shift in personnel gradually moves towards a civilian majority, with the military component eventually ceding operational control to the civilian component. This model is similar to the organization of NATO military and U.N. forces. Perito's model proposes transitioning from military to civilian control for security and law enforcement functions post-combat. The shift in personnel moves towards a civilian majority, with the military ceding operational control. Recommendations include deploying civilian personnel alongside combat forces and creating a standing interagency team for stabilization and reconstruction. The report suggests integrating civilian personnel with combat forces to facilitate the transfer of nation-building responsibilities. It recommends establishing a standing interagency team for stabilization and reconstruction, as well as creating an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps. Additionally, a proposal for an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State is put forward, along with the formation of a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve. The proposal includes the creation of a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians, managed by an Agency for Stability Operations reporting to the Secretary of State. This force aims to deploy rule of law personnel early in operations for long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. The proposal suggests creating a Civilian Stability Operations Corps to enhance security and stability in intervened or post-conflict countries. This force would require changes in U.S. practices, including developing constabulary capabilities and recruiting police personnel through a new federal agency. These changes could be controversial. The proposal suggests creating a Civilian Stability Operations Corps through a new federal agency to recruit police personnel, which could be controversial due to changes in U.S. practices. Arguments on restructuring military forces and government-employment versus government-contracted models for deployments are discussed. Deployment ease will depend on recruitment and hiring methods. The model for CivPol deployments discussed in H.R. 2616 is different from a reserve system. Rapid deployment depends on recruitment methods, with federalizing CivPol favored over private contractors. Personnel availability for quick deployment hinges on recruitment arrangements. The availability of personnel for rapid deployment may depend on recruitment methods, with federalizing CivPol preferred over private contractors. Law enforcement and rule of law personnel may require benefits similar to U.S. military reserve members for immediate deployment. Sources: U.N. Peacekeeping Fact Sheets, EU Police fact sheet, OMIK information from OSCE website, United Nations' The Blue Helmets. Sources for peacekeeping information can be found on various websites such as the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, EU Police, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Additional resources include books like \"The Blue Helmets\" by the United Nations and \"Policing the New World Disorder\" by Robert B. Oakley, Michael J. Dziedzic, and Eliot Goldberg. Note: Some U.N. civilian police missions are not included in this chart. The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces dates back to the late 1800s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping occurred in 1960. Some U.N. civilian police missions are not included in the chart. The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces dates back to the late 1800s. U.N. civilian police were first used in peacekeeping in 1960, with missions in the Congo and West New Guinea. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus has been active since 1964. In 1962-63, the United Nations provided UNTEA to administer West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian rule and recruited Philippine police officers to assist the local force. The UNFICYP, starting in 1964, was the first operation to use the term UNCIVPOL and the first multilateral U.N. police force. UNFICYP CivPols helped Cypriot police maintain order and security in sensitive areas to ease tensions. Monitoring mandates in Cambodia and other regions from 1989 to early 1992 focused on overseeing local police performance. The earliest post-cold war operations focused on monitoring local police performance in regions like Namibia and Western Sahara from 1989 to early 1992. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process leading to independence, with unarmed CivPol monitors assisting in patrolling and investigating complaints about local police. The U.N. operations during the Cold War period included the establishment of UNTAG in Namibia to monitor the electoral process for independence. CivPol monitors assisted in patrolling and investigating complaints about local police. UNTAG set the model for future missions in the early 1990s, focusing on accompanying local police, receiving public complaints, and supervising investigations. MINURSO followed in 1991 to carry out a referendum in Southwest Sahara. In 1991, MINURSO was established by the United Nations to oversee a referendum in Southwest Sahara. This referendum has been delayed due to opposition from Morocco. Additionally, police monitors were deployed in Angola and Cambodia in the early 1990s to monitor peace accords in challenging situations. In the early 1990s, police monitors were deployed in challenging situations with less established institutions and tenuous peace accords. Despite limited mandates, additional functions were deemed necessary. The U.N. Protection Force peacekeeping operation deployed CivPols to new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, but their missions were overwhelmed by armed conflict due to inadequate mandates and insufficient forces. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a large and ambitious peacekeeping operation where police served a monitoring mandate. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) faced challenges due to inadequate mandate and insufficient military forces. The focus of the UNTAC police unit shifted to investigating violations of political liberties and human rights, leading to the granting of arrest powers to CivPols for the first time in a U.N. operation. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in Cambodia in January 1993 due to failures in apprehending suspects of political liberty and human rights violations. However, these actions were deemed ineffective as deployment delays and inadequate police numbers hindered UNTAC's law and order enforcement efforts. The UNTAC operation in Cambodia faced challenges due to a lack of resources, hindering the effective performance of law and order enforcement. The mission shifted focus to monitoring elections and recognized the need for training police and judiciary. Limited resources led to makeshift training for civil police. The UNTAC police recognized the need for training police and judiciary due to limited resources. Analysts identified an \"institution gap\" in the judicial system, leading to the concept of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" to address the enforcement gap. Police reform and training components were added from 1992-1994 to address these challenges. The Pol Pot regime systematically removed individuals punished by UNTAC police. Analysts proposed deploying integrated \"justice packages\" including justice, penal officials, and police officers. Police reform became pivotal in the U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador, with international support for civilian control of security forces. International police forces' reform role was established through peace accords in January 1992, ending El Salvador's civil war. The international community provided extensive support to establish a new National Civilian Police force in El Salvador after the civil war ended in January 1992. This support included technical assistance, training, and material assistance. The United Nations played a key role in mediating the peace accords that led to the creation of the new police force. The United Nations oversaw the formation of a new police academy and force in El Salvador after the civil war, with support from the UN Development Program and international contributions. The ONUSAL mission included verifying and assisting in the transition period, training recruits for the CNP force, and coordinating with existing National Police authorities. The establishment of a new police academy and force in El Salvador was overseen by the United Nations, with support from the UN Development Program and international contributions. The success of this initiative was considered crucial for the country's reconciliation and democratization processes, despite encountering significant challenges. The establishment of a new police force in El Salvador overseen by the United Nations was seen as a success, despite facing significant challenges. Analysts noted that the success convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. Subsequent missions in other countries also had training and reform mandates. The Mozambique civilian police operation authorized in February 1994 had a monitoring mission with a small training assistance component. It was a precursor to later training and police reform missions, although ONUMOZ itself did not conduct the training. International police support continued after the formal UN operations through follow-up police reform programs primarily conducted through bilateral training. International police support in Mozambique continued after the formal UN operations through bilateral training programs, particularly by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Similar training and reform efforts were seen in Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti, with the US leading initiatives in Somalia through UNITAF to restore order after the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship. The U.S.-led United Task Force (UNITAF) initiated efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and restore order in Somalia after the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship. UNITAF established an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) to enforce locally agreed-upon laws and be controlled by the community, eventually present in 17 cities and towns. The ASF was created by UNITAF to enforce local laws and be controlled by the community in Somalia. It aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, reduce friction with the local population, and create jobs for unemployed Somalis. The creation of a police force in Somalia by UNITAF aimed to address ordinary criminal activity, provide jobs for unemployed Somalis, and allow the Somali police to act independently with allied military forces as backup. Assistance from UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations supported the Somali police with salaries, equipment, and refurbishing of police stations. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts also contributed to the new force with uniforms and equipment. The UNDP, UNITAF, and other nations provided support to the Somali police force, including salaries, equipment, and training. Italian, Dutch, and German experts contributed uniforms and supplies, while UNITAF military forces offered surplus vehicles and radios. The World Food Program supplied food rations for ASF members. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993, with ASF operating in Mogadishu and other cities. The UNDP, UNITAF, and other nations supported the Somali police force with salaries, equipment, and training. The World Food Program provided food rations for ASF members. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993, with ASF operating in Mogadishu and other cities. Despite challenges from General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction, UN efforts to rebuild the Somali police, courts, and prisons faced staffing and funding issues. The UN's efforts to reconstruct the Somali police, courts, and prisons faced challenges from General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction. Despite ambitious plans, inadequate staffing and funding hindered progress. Training and cultural differences among UNCIVPOL members also impeded the development of a coherent program. Programs to train Somali police officers collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity. The U.S. military worked with ICITAP to develop police courses for Somali officers, but the programs collapsed due to escalating violence and insecurity. ICITAP withdrew in June 1994, and UNCIVPOLs left in March 1995. UNITAF ASF achieved some success in providing police forces protection, but by the end of the 1990s, the need for police institution development and reform was widely recognized. The need for police institution development and reform was widely recognized by the end of the 1990s. The August 2000 Brahimi Panel Report recommended a \"doctrinal shift\" in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations, emphasizing the role of CivPol personnel in building local police services capacity. Analysts noted a law enforcement gap in Somalia due to UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs, similar to UNITAF's support for ASF. The lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs in Somalia led to the development of the concept of a law enforcement gap. Analysts observed that having an adequate police force may not be enough to control violence in post-conflict situations without a widely-accepted peace accord. Military force was sometimes necessary to maintain law and order, either as the primary force or as a supplement to police forces. The Somalia operation also highlighted other issues, such as the need for an international civilian police force. The lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs in Somalia led to the concept of a law enforcement gap. Military force may be needed to maintain law and order in the absence of a peace accord. The Somalia operation revealed issues with international civilian police forces and highlighted problems with training local police and the lack of adequate courts and political settlement. Similar gaps were seen in Haiti despite intensive police reform efforts. The lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs in Somalia led to the concept of a law enforcement gap. In Haiti, intensive police reform efforts revealed problems with the institutional gap and lack of political settlement, undermining long-term success. The U.S.-led Multilateral Force (MFN) initiated police reform in Haiti, forming the International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) to train a new Haitian national police force. The International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) was formed to create and train a new Haitian national police force, with members allowed to carry arms, use force, and make arrests. The subsequent UN Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) took over monitoring and training functions, with three follow-on missions sent over the next five years to continue professionalizing the Haitian police. Coordination between the military, MNF, and UNMIH civilian police was crucial for establishing and maintaining public security during the training and deployment of the HNP. The subsequent UN missions in Haiti continued to professionalize the Haitian police, with careful coordination between the military, MNF, and UNMIH civilian police to establish public security. The United States adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot serious criminals when IPMs were slow to deploy. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to fill deployment gaps before the planned deployment of the HNP. The interim public security force in Haiti was rapidly forced to fill deployment gaps before the planned deployment of the HNP. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training with the IPMs on basic policing matters. UNMIH also contributed to restoring stability by conducting military patrols to deter crime and political violence. The UNMIH operation in Haiti filled law enforcement gaps by providing rapid backup to UNCIVPOL and MPs for liaison and technical assistance. They also monitored HNP performance and contributed to stability through military patrols. However, institutional gaps like overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system hindered public security establishment. The institutional gap, including overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system, hindered the establishment of public security in Bosnia. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002, focusing on monitoring and training under the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This role was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF). The United Nations was assigned the role of international police assistance in Bosnia under the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This responsibility was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF), focusing on monitoring, advising, training, and facilitating law enforcement activities in Bosnia. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) was established to advise, train, and facilitate law enforcement activities in Bosnia under the Dayton Accords. In 2003, the European Union took over police monitoring and training through the EU Police Mission (EUPM). The IPTF CivPols lacked enforcement powers and struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups. The IPTF CivPols in Bosnia lacked enforcement powers and struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups. Concerns about their effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations, with calls for a stronger mandate and a policing function for NATO peacekeeping forces. The early transfer of control in Sarajevo in 1996 tested both the IPTF and IFOR. The early transfer of control in Sarajevo in 1996 tested both the IPTF and IFOR, with IFOR providing assistance to the still-organizing IPTF. Despite only one death during the relocation process, the lack of enforcement powers led to dwellings being gutted, burned, and booby-trapped, highlighting an \"enforcement gap\" as neither IPTF nor IFOR had the authority or resources to act. The slow deployment of IPTF personnel led to challenges in Sarajevo, with dwellings being destroyed and booby-trapped due to an \"enforcement gap\" as IPTF lacked law enforcement powers. This resulted in a loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF, making it difficult to gain popular confidence. The IPTF in Bosnia faced challenges due to a lack of law enforcement powers, leading to a loss of credibility. The NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in late 1996 to provide backup support. Specialized paramilitary units within the IPTF were developed to handle exceptional law enforcement situations. The development of specialized paramilitary units within the IPTF, known as CivPols, filled a gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect elected officials and civilians in hostile areas. The formation of specialized paramilitary units within the IPTF, such as the Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) in Bosnia in 1998, filled the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. This successful experience led to the creation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. Additionally, in 1999, the mandates and powers of international civilian police were expanded in the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), granting them executive authority powers. In 1999, the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) granted international civilian police executive authority powers, including the ability to carry arms and make arrests due to the absence of legitimate local authority. NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo after the coalition air war against Serbia, with NATO providing military presence through the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the United Nations overseeing civil administration functions, including policing. After the coalition air war against Serbia, NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo and providing security through KFOR and UNMIK. In East Timor, UNTAET provided civil administration from 1999 to 2002 during its transition to independence from Indonesia. In East Timor, U.N. Transitional Administration (UNTAET) provided civil administration from 1999 to 2002 during its transition to independence from Indonesia. A mandate for U.N. forces, along with the Australian-led peacekeeping force INTERFET, was necessary to fill the security vacuum left by Indonesia's withdrawal. The use of executive authority in such situations is controversial and may not always be the best choice. The use of executive authority in situations without local police forces is seen as problematic and unlikely to be wise. The availability of international civilian police personnel is limited, making it difficult to recruit and deploy them in a timely manner. Sovereignty considerations will also play a role in decision-making regarding executive policing."
