FINDINGS.\" Step 4 - Summarized text chunk: \nCongress finds the need to increase the number of students prepared for STEM education, emphasizes the importance of hands-on laboratory experiences in science education, and acknowledges the current poor quality of such experiences for most students. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found that the quality of laboratory experiences in high schools is poor for most students, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. The Government Accountability Office reported that schools with higher concentrations of poor students lack adequate laboratory facilities. Additionally, college students who left the science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including a lack of laboratory experience. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research projects to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The Federal Government aims to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools through a grant program. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve teaching in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants may be used for equipment, instrumentation, and facilities.

The Federal share of the cost of activities carried out using amounts from a grant under this program shall not exceed 50 percent. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate the effectiveness of pilot projects funded by the grant program in improving student performance in math, science, engineering, and technology. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees within 5 years. The report will highlight best practices and materials developed by grant awardees. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act and its amendments includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
