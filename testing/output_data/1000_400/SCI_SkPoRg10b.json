    "content": "The approach to understanding the generalization properties of deep neural networks involves revisiting old ideas in statistical mechanics. A Very Simple Deep Learning (VSDL) model with two control parameters is used to describe how noise and early stopping affect network behavior. This model provides insights into the inability of deep neural networks to avoid overfitting training data. The text discusses the generalization properties of deep neural networks, focusing on the impact of noise and early stopping on network behavior. It highlights the complexity of neural networks and their tendency to overfit training data, leading to discontinuous learning and sharp transitions in generalization properties. Neural networks in deep learning exhibit complex properties leading to disparate conclusions about their behavior. Some claim DNNs are robust to noise, while others find them sensitive to even modest noise. The popular PAC theory and VC theory may not describe NN properties well. Optimization problems associated with DNNs are extremely non-convex, leading to issues like local minima. The PAC theory and VC theory may not accurately describe neural network properties. Optimization problems in deep learning are highly non-convex, leading to issues like local minima. There are conflicting views on whether convergence to flat or sharp minimizers is more beneficial. These tensions have been known in the neural network field for a long time but have gained recent attention due to a study by Zhang et al. on DNNs overtraining with noisy data. Recent attention has been given to the tendency of state-of-the-art neural networks to overtrain with noisy data. These networks can easily fit to noise and noisy data, potentially leading to overtraining. Popular regularization methods may or may not help in preventing this issue. State-of-the-art deep learning systems tend to overtrain with noisy data, despite attempts at regularization methods. Early stopping is the only parameter that effectively prevents overtraining, unlike methods such as dropout or adding noise to the input. This phenomenon contrasts with SVM, where overtraining does not occur even with good data. State-of-the-art deep learning systems tend to overtrain with noisy data, despite regularization methods like dropout or adding noise to the input. However, early stopping is the only parameter that effectively prevents overtraining. This contrasts with SVM, where overtraining does not occur even with good data. The text discusses the issue of overtraining in deep learning systems and the need to tune regularization parameters to prevent it. It highlights the qualitative differences in behavior between deep neural networks and other models like SVM. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of rethinking generalization in DNN-based learning and suggests revisiting old ideas on capacity control from statistical mechanics of neural networks. The text discusses the need to rethink generalization in DNN-based learning and suggests revisiting old ideas on capacity control from statistical mechanics of neural networks. It introduces the statistical mechanics theory of generalization applied to NNs and DNNs, providing a qualitative explanation of empirical properties not easily understandable from PAC/VC theory commonly used in ML. The SM approach can be formulated rigorously or non-rigorously, with the latter being more common but still providing precise insights. The SM approach in statistical mechanics provides a theory of generalization for models like DNNs, offering precise quantitative agreement with empirical results and explaining complex learning behaviors. It introduces phenomena like phases, phase transitions, and discontinuous learning naturally, based on control parameters of the ML process. The SM approach in statistical mechanics explains complex learning behaviors in DNNs based on control parameters. It introduces phenomena like phases, phase transitions, and discontinuous learning naturally. The VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models involves adjusting algorithm knobs and adding noise to input data. The VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models involves adjusting algorithm knobs and adding noise to input data. It is proposed that control parameters used in the learning process are analogous to parameters in traditional statistical mechanics, leading to complex learning behaviors. The VSDL model involves adjusting algorithm knobs and adding noise to input data. Control parameters in the learning process are analogous to parameters in traditional statistical mechanics, leading to complex learning behaviors. The existence of multiple parameters in the Hopfield model of associative memory results in complex generalization properties, including the inability to overfit noisy data. The generalization error changes dramatically at a critical value of the load parameter \u03b1 in a one-dimensional phase diagram. The generalization error changes dramatically at a critical value of the load parameter \u03b1 in a one-dimensional phase diagram. The two-dimensional phase diagram shows sharp transitions in generalization properties with noise added to data and algorithm adjustments. The generalization properties of the system vary smoothly with transitions in the system. Adding noise and adjusting parameters can impact generalization behavior, as illustrated in FIG1. Starting from point A, noise causes a decrease in \u03b1 leading to poor generalization at point B, which can be improved by adjusting the number of iterations. The VSDL model and its consequences are described in more detail. The generalization properties of the system can be impacted by adding noise and adjusting parameters, as shown in FIG1. Noise causes a decrease in \u03b1 from point A to point B, resulting in poor generalization, which can be improved by adjusting the number of iterations. The VSDL model and its consequences are discussed in more detail in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The SM approach to generalization can lead to quantitative results, but it is technically complex. The basic ideas and qualitative results are simple, different from the PAC/VC approach. The paper focuses on basic ideas and qualitative results, different from the PAC/VC approach. It warns against making broad claims about realistic DNN systems due to the complexity of control parameters and their interactions. The approach emphasizes the importance of model details, learning algorithms, data properties, and noise levels. The paper emphasizes the complexity of control parameters in DNN systems and their interactions, cautioning against broad claims. It highlights the importance of model details, learning algorithms, data properties, and noise levels in understanding generalization behavior. The next sections will delve into connecting practical DNN control parameters with load-like parameters, temperature-like parameters, and non-trivial generalization behavior in a VSDL model. In Section 2, the paper discusses the complexity of control parameters in DNN systems and their interactions. Section 3 presents the main contributions on connecting practical DNN control parameters with load-like parameters, temperature-like parameters, and non-trivial generalization behavior in a VSDL model. Section A provides a detailed discussion of the main result, while Section 4 offers a brief conclusion. The historical background of the SM approach to NNs is also mentioned, highlighting the equivalence between NN behavior with symmetric connections and the equilibrium SM behavior of magnetic systems like spin glasses. The SM approach to NNs has a long history, dating back to the earliest days of the field. There is an equivalence between NNs with symmetric connections and the equilibrium SM behavior of magnetic systems like spin glasses. Both the SM approach and PAC/VC theory were popular in the 80s/90s for controlling the generalization properties of NNs. The ML community later shifted to methods like Support Vector Machines and PAC/VC-based analysis for optimization objectives. The SM approach to NNs, popular in the 80s/90s, focused on controlling generalization properties. Recent theoretical work in ML has favored PAC/VC methods over SM. However, the SM approach can qualitatively describe new phenomena observed in DNNs. The SM approach to NNs focuses on generalization properties, contrasting with PAC/VC methods. It qualitatively describes new phenomena in DNNs, highlighting diverse properties in learning curves. The SM approach to NNs explains the complex nature of generalization in learning curves, highlighting discontinuities and dependencies on various factors such as model details, algorithms, regularization, and data properties. The generalization performance of deep learning systems can be sensitive to model details, algorithm properties, regularization, and data characteristics. Researchers have observed complex and counterintuitive properties in recent years. This separation allows for separate consideration of algorithmic optimization and statistical inference questions. The separation of algorithmic optimization and statistical inference questions in deep learning systems can be limiting due to strong distribution assumptions and technical complexity. PAC/VC theory provides upper bounds on generalization accuracy, but can be non-rigorous in its application. The SM approach to generalization in deep learning involves phases, phase transitions, and phase diagrams, with NNs exhibiting different phases based on control parameters. These details are often not well-described in publications, making it challenging to reproduce results. The SM approach to generalization in deep learning involves phases, phase transitions, and phase diagrams where NNs exhibit different behaviors based on control parameters. The phase diagram illustrates how the system's behavior changes based on control parameters, such as load and temperature, in models like the Hopfield associative memory. The system can transition between different phases, affecting its retrieval properties significantly. The system can transition between different phases, such as a spin glass phase or a low-\u03c4 low-\u03b1 memory phase, which can dramatically change its retrieval properties. NNs' generalization properties change based on control parameters of the learning process, as shown in an idealized model of deep learning computations. The generalization properties of NNs change based on control parameters of the learning process. A simplified model of deep learning computations explains aspects of large modern DNN performance. Three main claims are presented: the VSDL model captures practical control parameters, the thermodynamic limit is suitable for analyzing the model, and the model exhibits non-trivial learning phases. The VSDL model captures practical control parameters in DNN systems, the thermodynamic limit is suitable for analysis, and the model shows non-trivial learning phases. The VSDL model in deep learning maps input images to output labels using parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4, which can be controlled during training. This model is compared to control parameters like temperature and pressure in thermodynamics. The VSDL model in deep learning, referred to as Very Simple Deep Learning, allows for easy control of parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4 during training. Analogous to control parameters in thermodynamics like temperature and pressure, the model demonstrates transitions between different states based on parameter values. In deep learning, the macroscopic properties of DNN learning systems are of primary interest, rather than microscopic improvements. Adding noise to the training data decreases an effective load \u03b1, which corresponds to randomizing labels or adding noisy data to the training set. Adding noise to the training data decreases an effective load \u03b1, which corresponds to randomizing labels or adding noisy data to the training set. This is justified by considering a well-trained DNN model trained on m data points and then randomizing a fraction of the labels. The effective capacity of a model trained on data can be altered by randomizing labels, reducing the effective number of training examples. This noise decreases the load on the network, as indicated by the parameter \u03b1 = m eff /N. Adding noise to training data decreases the load on the network, as the model capacity remains similar or unchanged. Realistic DNNs have a model capacity that scales with the number of data points, not the effective number of training examples. Adding noise to training data decreases the load on the network, as the model capacity remains similar or unchanged. Realistic DNNs have a model capacity that scales with the number of data points, not the effective number of training examples. When training a new DNN model on a set of data points with noisy labels, the model may overtrain due to excessive capacity. Early stopping acts as a control parameter similar to increasing an effective temperature within a stochastic iterative training algorithm. Early stopping acts as a control parameter similar to increasing an effective temperature within a stochastic iterative training algorithm, which helps prevent overtraining in deep neural networks with excessive capacity. The temperature \u03c4 in a stochastic learning algorithm corresponds to the learning rate and annealing rate schedule of the SGD algorithm. It decreases the variability of neural network weights as the number of steps taken by the algorithm increases. This temperature-like parameter depends on the number of steps taken and affects the learning process. The VSDL model uses parameters \u03c4 and \u03b1 to control the learning process, such as adding noise to input data or early-stopping. Other factors affecting learning are ignored for simplicity. These parameters provide a more concise description and can be adjusted by practitioners. Other quantities like VC dimension and growth function are not practical for controlling learning. The VSDL model uses parameters \u03c4 and \u03b1 to control the learning process, such as adding noise to input data or early-stopping. When analyzing modern DNNs, a thermodynamic limit should be considered where the hypothesis space and data points diverge. When analyzing modern DNNs, a thermodynamic limit should be considered where the hypothesis space and data points diverge, allowing the model complexity to grow with the number of parameters. This approach contrasts with the PAC/VC approach to generalization and involves technical complexities associated with the limit. The SM approach to generalization involves complexities associated with the thermodynamic limit, as described in references. The VSDL model exhibits error plots in one-dimensional and two-dimensional phase diagrams based on parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4. The VSDL model shows error plots in one-dimensional and two-dimensional phase diagrams based on parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4. In the two-dimensional phase diagram, the generalization and training errors are plotted as a function of \u03b1, with lines between different phases of learning shown instead of a third axis. For \u03c4 = 0, increasing \u03b1 decreases the generalization error gradually until a critical value \u03b1 c is reached, where it decreases dramatically. For \u03c4 = 0, increasing \u03b1 decreases generalization error gradually until a critical value \u03b1 c is reached, where it decreases dramatically. Decreasing \u03b1 from a large value increases generalization error gradually until \u03b1 c is reached, where it increases dramatically. The transition from \u03b1 > \u03b1 c to \u03b1 < \u03b1 c results in a dramatic increase in generalization error, where training data fits well but test data fits poorly. These observations apply for any \u03c4 value, with \u03b1 c potentially varying. For any given value of \u03c4, a dramatic increase in generalization error occurs when transitioning from \u03b1 > \u03b1 c to \u03b1 < \u03b1 c. This is illustrated in FIG1 (b). For \u03c4 > \u03c4 c, the sharp transition in learning as a function of \u03b1 may disappear, resulting in only one phase of learning. Adding noise to data and adjusting algorithm parameters is represented in FIG1 (c) in the (\u03b1, \u03c4) plane. Adding noise to data and adjusting algorithm parameters can lead to a decrease in generalization properties, as illustrated in FIG1 (c) in the (\u03b1, \u03c4) plane. When a fraction of data labels are randomly changed, the system moves to a new point with different parameter values, resulting in worse generalization behavior on new noisy data. The system moves to point B with parameter values (\u03b1 B , \u03c4 B ), where \u03c4 B = \u03c4 A. If enough data labels are changed, \u03b1 < \u03b1 c, leading to worse generalization properties. Adjusting the temperature parameter \u03c4 can compensate for this. Moving to point C with parameter values (\u03b1 C , \u03c4 C ), where \u03b1 C = \u03b1 B, can result in better generalization properties if the iterative algorithm is stopped properly. Neural networks can easily overtrain if the iterative algorithm is stopped properly, leading to better generalization properties. There is no global control parameter for NNs and DNNs like Tikhonov value or number of vectors in TSVD for controlling generalization. Certain values of parameters \u03c4 and \u03b1 control the learning process, affecting the system's phase. The Tikhonov value \u03bb and number of vectors k in TSVD are control parameters for generalization in neural networks. Certain values of \u03c4 and \u03b1 control the learning process to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods may or may not help in this context. The number of iterations t is a regularization parameter for NNs and DNNs. In an idealized model, \u03c4 and \u03b1 are the key control parameters to prevent overfitting. In an idealized model of neural networks, \u03c4 and \u03b1 are key control parameters to prevent overfitting. The number of iterations t is a regularization parameter that can help in this context. The VSDL model and SM theory of generalization offer a different approach compared to the PAC/VC approach in machine learning. The VSDL model and SM theory of generalization provide a powerful way to rethink generalization in neural networks, offering a different approach from the PAC/VC method. While technically complex, revisiting these old ideas can be valuable, and further details can be found in fundamental material. The VSDL model simplifies complex DNNs with two control parameters, explaining generalization using SM theory. The approach offers insights into DNNs' limitations. The VSDL model simplifies DNNs with control parameters, explaining generalization using SM theory. Recent work connects Lipshitz constant analysis and Information Bottleneck ideas to understand learning algorithms better. In BID44, authors analyze scale-sensitive analysis with Lipshitz constant and margin-based boosting methods. BID45 uses Information Bottleneck ideas to study information compression in stochastic optimization algorithms. These lines of work complement the VSDL model's approach to understanding generalization in DNNs. Revisiting old ideas can be fruitful, as recent evidence suggests DNNs have generalization phase diagrams based on control parameters. Recent empirical evidence suggests that every DNN has a generalization phase diagram based on control parameters. Fiddling with algorithm knobs moves around a parameter space, leading to phases where generalization changes gradually or breaks down. Existing methods often conflate optimization and regularization issues, highlighting the need to better delineate the two in theory. The VSDL model and SM approach provide explanations for various empirical phenomena, including discontinuities in generalization performance and sensitivity to model and algorithm details. It is challenging to evaluate the conjecture of a \"low temperature\" spin glass phase due to the conflation of optimization and regularization issues in existing methods and the non-reproducibility of empirical results. The VSDL model and SM approach explain discontinuities in generalization performance and sensitivity to model and algorithm details. Simplified models studied with the SM approach help understand these aspects of large DNNs. In this section, we delve into simple models that capture aspects of realistic large DNNs, studied with the SM approach. These models help explain why the generalization behavior of the VSDL model exhibits discontinuous properties. In this section, several simple models of multilayer networks are discussed, with properties consistent with Observations 1 and/or 2. The text also covers the PAC/VC versus SM approach to generalization, the root of discontinuous generalization properties, evidence in larger DNNs, and popular mechanisms for regularization. The discussion aims to address the question of generalization diagrams in network architectures. The text discusses simple network architectures like the fully-connected committee machine, tree-based parity machine, and one-layer reversedwedge Ising perceptron, highlighting their multilayer and representation capabilities essential for modern DNN success. Multilayer networks are stronger in representation than single layer networks, with the mentioned architectures representing extreme cases of connectivity. The fully-connected committee machine is a multi-layer network with strong representational power, specified by vectors connecting inputs to hidden units. It captures the essence of multilayer networks and their capabilities in modern DNNs. The fully-connected committee machine is a multi-layer network with one hidden layer containing K elements, specified by vectors connecting inputs to hidden units. The model operates by majority vote of the hidden layer, showing discontinuous behavior in generalization error as a function of control parameters. The fully-connected committee machine is a multi-layer network with one hidden layer containing K elements, specified by vectors connecting inputs to hidden units. The model operates by majority vote of the hidden layer, showing discontinuous behavior in generalization error as a function of control parameters. The tree-based parity machine is also a multi-layer network with a tree-like structure for hidden units, outputting based on the parity of these units. The one-layer reversed-wedge Ising perceptron model is a single layer network with a non-trivial activation function. It classifies inputs as +1 or -1 based on the value of \u03bb compared to \u03b3. The activation function's non-monotonicity represents the model's representation ability. See (49; 50) for more details on this model. The activation function in the one-layer reversed-wedge Ising perceptron model is non-monotonic, representing its representation ability. Classification is determined by the value of \u03bb compared to \u03b3, resulting in a +1 or -1 output. The learning curve, shown in FIG3, displays the generalization error \u03b5 in relation to the control parameter \u03b1 for various values of \u03b3, highlighting the abrupt changes in \u03b5 as \u03b1 varies. This behavior is consistent across different cases, indicating a discontinuous generalization pattern. The learning curve shows abrupt changes in generalization error as a function of a load-like parameter. Different values of parameters may affect the generalization behavior, with some values leading to discontinuous patterns. Two simpler models will be discussed to explain this behavior, with a focus on understanding generalization in machine learning. The classification of elements into two classes is considered, with a target rule T in place. Two simpler models are analyzed from two complementary approaches to the theory of generalization in machine learning. The classification of elements into two classes is considered, with a target rule T and a hypothesis space F. The problem of learning from examples involves selecting an element from F to approximate T on the input space X. The problem of learning from examples involves selecting an element from a hypothesis space F to approximate a target rule T on the input space X. The generalization error \u03b5 is the probability of disagreement between the student's hypothesis and the teacher's target on a randomly chosen subset of X. The student iterates the process of constructing a new mapping f t based on the presented element x t and the teacher's label T(x t). The student iterates the process of constructing a new mapping f t based on the presented element x t and the teacher's label T(x t) in the iterative learning algorithm. The version space at a given time step t is the subset of X compatible with the data/labels presented so far. In the realizable case, the zero-temperature Gibbs learning rule is sometimes considered. The version space at time step t in the iterative learning algorithm is the subset of X compatible with the data seen so far. The training error \u03b5 t quantifies the student's performance on the training set, while the generalization error measures the quality of generalization. The learning curve characterizes the behavior of the difference between training error and generalization error as a function of control parameters. The learning curve characterizes the difference between training error and generalization error as a function of control parameters in the training set. The PAC/VC approach to generalization involves viewing the training set size as the main control parameter and analyzing how the error varies with increasing m. In the PAC framework, the problem of deciding which hypothesis will perform well on the complete input is related to the convergence of frequencies to probabilities. Approaches like the law of large numbers or central limit theorem for m \u2192 \u221e, and Hoeffding-type bounds for finite m values are considered. However, the rule f * is not independent of the training data, so alternative methods are needed. In the PAC/VC approach, a uniform bound over the hypothesis space F is constructed by focusing on the worst-case scenario. This approach considers the growth function and VC dimension of F to minimize empirical error. Sauer and Vapnik and Chervonenkis showed that similar results can be obtained even if the cardinality of F is infinite, as long as the classification diversity is not too large. The PAC/VC approach focuses on constructing a uniform bound over the hypothesis space F by considering the growth function and VC dimension to minimize empirical error. Sauer and Vapnik and Chervonenkis demonstrated that similar results can be achieved even with an infinite cardinality of F, as long as the classification diversity is not too large. The generalization error is bounded above by a power law decay dependent on the inverse power of m, with the VC dimension being the only problem-specific quantity in these bounds. The power law decay in generalization error is dependent on the VC dimension, which measures the complexity of the function class F. These bounds are universal and hold for any F, input distribution, and target distribution. The thermodynamic limit allows for the divergence of both training set size m and the cardinality of F N in a well-defined manner. The thermodynamic limit allows for the divergence of training set size and the cardinality of the function class F in a well-defined manner, providing the basis for the SM approach to generalization. The SM approach to generalization was first proposed as a way to describe the learning curve of a parametric class of functions. It involves classifying elements of an input space into two classes using a sequence of target functions derived from classes of functions trained with increasing data sets. The SM approach involves classifying elements of an input space into two classes using a sequence of target functions derived from classes of functions trained with increasing data sets. It explores the competition between error value and the logarithm of the number of functions at a given error value to describe learning curves. The limit of the number of functions in a class at a given error value can be exploited by describing learning curves as a \"competition\" between error value and the logarithm of the number of functions. As the sample size or number of functions approaches infinity, a non-trivial result is not expected unless the ratio of sample size to number of functions is a fixed constant. This ratio, denoted as \u03b1, is analogous to the load on the network in associative memory models and serves as a control parameter for investigating generalization error. The sample size and function class sizes are fixed, with the ratio of sample size to number of functions denoted as \u03b1. This ratio serves as a control parameter for investigating generalization error. Two complementary approaches to the theory of generalization will be described, along with simpler models to understand the behavior observed in various problems. The behavior observed in various problems, including committee machine, parity machine, and reversed-wedge Ising perceptron, will be explained through simpler models. These models illustrate key issues and have been analyzed rigorously, through numerical simulations, and replica-based calculations from statistical physics. See specific sections for a detailed description. The basic single-layer perceptron model is described in three ways: through rigorous analysis, numerical simulations, and replica-based calculations from statistical physics. The classification rule is based on the angle between the input vector and the weights vector. The vectors are normalized to lie on the surface of an N-dimensional sphere with radius \u221aN. In the single-layer perceptron model, the classification rule is based on the angle between the input vector and the weights vector. The vectors are normalized to lie on the surface of an N-dimensional sphere with radius \u221aN. The generalization error depends only on the overlap between the input and weights vectors. The generalization error in the perceptron model depends on the overlap parameter between the input and weights vectors. There are two basic versions of the perceptron: the continuous perceptron where weights are continuous and lie on an N-dimensional sphere, and the Ising perceptron where weights are either -1 or +1 and lie on the corners of an N-dimensional hypercube. The Ising perceptron model, with weights constrained to \u00b11 on an N-dimensional hypercube, exhibits a phase transition not well-described by PAC/VC theory. The generalization error decreases as training set size increases, with vectors becoming incompatible with data. The probability of a vector remaining compatible with the teacher can be quantified by grouping vectors into classes based on their overlap. The generalization error decreases as the training set size increases, with vectors becoming incompatible with data. The probability of a vector remaining compatible with the teacher can be quantified by grouping vectors into classes based on their overlap and generalization error. The generalization error decreases as the training set size increases, with vectors becoming incompatible with data. The probability of a vector remaining compatible with the teacher can be quantified by grouping vectors into classes based on their overlap and generalization error. The volume of compatible students with generalization error \u03b5 after being presented m training examples is controlled by the balance between entropy and energy. The entropy and energy control the volume of compatible students with generalization error \u03b5. The entropy slowly diverges to \u2212\u221e as \u03b5 \u2192 0, while the energy behaves as \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. In the thermodynamic limit, the quantity is dominated by the maximum value of the expression. In the context of controlling the volume of compatible students with generalization error \u03b5, the entropy slowly diverges to \u2212\u221e as \u03b5 \u2192 0, while the energy behaves as \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. In the thermodynamic limit, the quantity is dominated by the maximum value of the expression in the square brackets. In the context of controlling the volume of compatible students with generalization error \u03b5, the entropy slowly diverges to \u2212\u221e as \u03b5 \u2192 0, while the energy behaves as \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. The Ising perceptron shows a different behavior with entropy approaching zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0 or as R \u2192 1, indicating exactly one state with R = 1. The energy behaves as e(\u03b5) \u223c \u2212\u03b1 ln(1 \u2212 \u03b5) \u223c \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. The entropy approaches zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0 or as R \u2192 1, indicating one state with R = 1. The energy behaves as e(\u03b5) \u223c \u2212\u03b1 ln(1 \u2212 \u03b5) \u223c \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. The optimal value is at the boundary \u03b5 = 0 (or R = 1), leading to discontinuous behavior in generalization error with increasing training set size. The behavior of the continuous perceptron shows a smooth decrease in generalization error with increasing data, while the discrete Ising perceptron exhibits more complex behavior with a one-dimensional phase diagram depending on the control parameter \u03b1. The optimal value is at the boundary \u03b5 = 0 (or R = 1), leading to discontinuous changes in generalization error. The behavior of the continuous perceptron is simple, showing a smooth decrease in generalization error with more data. In contrast, the discrete Ising perceptron with control parameter \u03b1 has a more complex generalization behavior, with two phases depending on \u03b1 value. The learning system can reside in a phase with large, smoothly decreasing generalization or a phase with small or zero generalization, with a discontinuous change between them. This discussion focuses on realizable learning with the zero-temperature Gibbs learning rule, but in general, there may be additional control parameters in non-realizable learning scenarios. The discussion shifts to the two-dimensional phase diagram of the discrete Ising perceptron, showing different phases based on values of \u03b1 and \u03c4. These phases include perfect generalization, poor generalization, a spin glass phase, and metastable regimes. The phase diagram reveals non-trivial behavior influenced by both \u03b1 and \u03c4 control parameters. The two-dimensional phase diagram of the discrete Ising perceptron displays various phases depending on \u03b1 and \u03c4 values, including perfect generalization, poor generalization, a spin glass phase, and metastable regimes. The diagram also shows the trivial phase diagram of the continuous perceptron for comparison. The SM approach to learning theory characterizes generalization as a competition between entropy-like and energy-like terms, providing rigorous results and intuitive explanations. Results from the rigorous SM approach show that generalization in the SM theory of learning involves a competition between entropy-like and energy-like terms. The version space V(S) and the -ball around the target function are key concepts, with lower bounds on \u03b4 indicating generalization error. The -ball around the target function, denoted as B(), is a sample-independent subclass of f containing functions with generalization error \u03b5 not larger than . Lower bounds on \u03b4 = Pr [V(S) \u2286 B()] provide bounds on the generalization error \u03b5 of any consistent learning algorithm. If the failure probability \u03b4 is fixed, functions in F with generalization error greater than can be denoted as B(). The probability that a function h with generalization error \u03b5(h) remains in a sample-independent subclass of functions is given by a bound that does not depend on the distribution or target function, but only on the size of the function class. This bound ensures that any consistent function satisfies \u03b5(h) \u2264 1/m ln (|F|/\u03b4) with high probability. The bound on generalization error for a consistent function is \u03b5(h) \u2264 1/m ln (|F|/\u03b4), with probability at least 1 - \u03b4, regardless of distribution or target function. This bound is weak and can result in large values of \u03b5(h). More refined upper bounds can be obtained by considering errors and the number of hypotheses achieving those errors. Upper bounds on generalization error can be refined by tracking errors and the number of hypotheses achieving those errors. If a parametric class of functions is considered, the expression can be rewritten to show that the generalization error can be bounded by a certain value. Upper bounds on generalization error can be refined by tracking errors and the number of hypotheses achieving those errors. If a parametric class of functions is considered, the expression can be rewritten to show that the generalization error can be bounded by a certain value. In Eqn. FORMULA20, log Q (11) states that in the thermodynamic limit, the sum equals 0 if we only sum terms in Eqn. BID17 for which > * + \u03c4. This allows us to bound generalization error by * + \u03c4, with * representing the error value above which the energy term always dominates the entropy term. This concept is applied to the continuous perceptron and the Ising perceptron, with an entropy upper bound of s( ) = 1 for the continuous perceptron. The error value above which the energy term always dominates the entropy term is represented by *. This concept is applied to the continuous perceptron and the Ising perceptron, with specific entropy upper bounds for each. The Ising perceptron shows a gradual decrease of energy with increasing alpha, consistent with theory. An entropy upper bound is shown for the Ising perceptron, with very few configurations having energy slightly greater than the minimum value. The learning curve for the energy-entropy competition is plotted based on these findings. The Ising perceptron exhibits a gradual decrease in energy with increasing alpha, with very few configurations having energy slightly greater than the minimum value. The learning curve for the energy-entropy competition is plotted based on these findings, showing a non-smooth decrease of energy with alpha. The plot in FIG5 shows a sudden decrease to 0 at a critical value of \u03b1, where the minimum is at the boundary for larger \u03b1 values. This non-smooth decrease of \u03b5 with \u03b1 is not explained by PAC/VC theory but is consistent with results from Eqn. BID12. Theoretical and empirical work on loss surfaces of NNs/DNNs supports the use of idealized models to understand realistic DNNs. Theoretical and empirical work on loss surfaces of NNs/DNNs suggests a connection between NNs/DNNs and spin glasses. Results from a histogram count show similarities with the random energy model (REM), which exhibits a transition in entropy density at a non-zero temperature parameter. The random energy model (REM) is a weaker hypothesis compared to a spin glass. It shows a transition in entropy density at a non-zero temperature parameter, leading to a large number of configurations above a critical value and a single configuration below it. This phenomenon is responsible for the complex learning behavior discussed, as illustrated analytically and pictorially. The Ising perceptron exhibits a small entropy for configurations with loss slightly above the minimum value, leading to complex learning behavior. This phenomenon is contrasted with the continuous perceptron in Eqn. BID12 and visually in FIG5 (g). The conjecture is that every DNN displays this behavior. The connection between this discussion and regularization methods like early stopping in the VSDL model is explored, along with the Tikhonov-Phillips and TSVD methods for solving ill-posed LS problems. The Tikhonov-Phillips method and TSVD method are used to solve ill-posed LS problems in the context of regularization methods like early stopping in the VSDL model. The methods address issues such as rank deficiency and poor conditioning of matrices to prevent overfitting and improve generalization to new data. The Tikhonov-Phillips method and TSVD method address rank deficiency and poor conditioning in LS problems to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The TSVD method replaces the original problem with a rank-k approximation to A, while the Tikhonov-Phillips method introduces a regularization parameter \u03bb to find a solution that is less sensitive to the data. The TSVD method provides a best rank-k approximation to matrix A by replacing singular values with 0. The control parameter \u03bb in the Tikhonov-Phillips approach controls convergence radius, while parameter k restricts the domain and range of A k. Adjusting \u03bb or k can prevent overfitting but may lead to underfitting. The TSVD method provides a best rank-k approximation to matrix A by replacing singular values with 0. The control parameter \u03bb in the Tikhonov-Phillips approach controls convergence radius, while parameter k restricts the domain and range of A k. Adjusting \u03bb or k can prevent overfitting but may lead to underfitting. One can always choose a value of \u03bb (or k) to prevent overfitting, potentially at the expense of underfitting. This is due to the linear structure of A T A + \u03bb 2 I (and of A k ). For non-linear dynamical systems, there is no reason to expect this to be true. Both approaches generalize to a wide range of other problems. The linear regularization approaches historically did not work well on neural networks in the 80s/90s. Increasing control parameters can prevent overfitting, even if it leads to underfitting, as seen in statistical learning theory. In the 80s/90s, linear regularization approaches were ineffective for neural networks. Increasing control parameters like \u03bb and k can prevent overfitting, even if it results in underfitting, as emphasized in statistical learning theory. The early stopping of iterative algorithms was a more successful approach for training NNs, termed implicit regularization. When reducing machine learning problems to optimization objectives, \u03bb and k are seen as fundamental control parameters. Regularization in learning algorithms is viewed differently when defined operationally without a specific objective. The connection to Tikhonov-Phillips/TSVD is only precise in linear or linearizable cases. Dynamics leading to generalization through the SM approach do not typically optimize linear or convex problems. In special cases, a connection with Tikhonov-Phillips/TSVD can be made, but it is not generally expected. The dynamics leading to generalization do not optimize linear or convex objectives but follow a stochastic Langevin type dynamics, connected to Gibbs probability distribution. These dynamics, similar to SGD used in training DNNs, suggest a broader application of the SM approach to generalization. The dynamics of general dynamical systems have connections with stochastic dynamics like SGD used in training DNNs, indicating a broader application of the SM approach to generalization. General dynamical systems exhibit phases, phase transitions, and phase diagrams, but lack the structure necessary to obtain generalization bounds. A phase transition in parameter space can lead to different fixed points in dynamical systems. However, general dynamical systems lack the structure needed for generalization bounds, making it challenging to use control parameters as regularization parameters. Adding noise to a system may not always prevent overfitting, as the quality of generalization can vary non-linearly with changes in the regularization parameter. The hope is that a regularization parameter can prevent overfitting by smoothly varying the quality of generalization. This can be achieved by increasing the regularization parameter, as shown in optimization problems. The PAC/VC approach provides smooth upper bounds, making it easier to reason about the limit defined by one quantity diverging. The PAC/VC approach provides smooth upper bounds for generalization, but empirical results for NNs and DNNs suggest that regularity conditions often do not hold, leading to consequences that need further exploration."
