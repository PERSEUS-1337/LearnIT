    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate due to increased mortgage defaults and borrowing costs. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced capital inadequacy due to rising mortgage defaults and borrowing costs. To support them during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock and the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS. The enterprises are required to pay a 10% cash dividend on the Treasury funds, but their ability to survive is uncertain. The Federal Reserve and Treasury have provided support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by purchasing MBS and preferred stock. Legislation may reduce the enterprises' size and increase their costs, potentially leading to higher interest rates for borrowers. Proposed legislation, such as H.R. 1222 and H.R. 1227, aims to increase costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially leading to higher interest rates for borrowers. Other bills, like H.R. 31 and H.R. 1225, would impose new limitations on mortgage purchases and increase regulatory oversight. These changes could reduce risks but also raise costs for the enterprises. The proposed legislative changes aim to increase regulatory oversight and disclosure for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They also include increased capital requirements to reduce risks. Additionally, new requirements would eliminate competitive advantages and set deadlines for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved. Provisions are also made for replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. The bills introduced in the 112th Congress aim to phase out the charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with provisions for replacing them in the secondary mortgage markets. The enterprises entered voluntary conservatorship in 2008 due to financial difficulties caused by mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. Treasury contracts were signed to provide financial support to keep them afloat. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship, giving control to the FHFA. The Treasury signed contracts to provide financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners rely on them for mortgage funding. They purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into MBS, and either keep or sell them to investors. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee repayment of the loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into MBS, and either keep or sell them to investors. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the enterprises and the housing finance system. No legislation has been passed yet. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system, including government mortgage programs targeted towards specific groups and a privatized system with government backup reinsurance. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement these proposals. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system, including government mortgage programs targeted towards specific groups and a privatized system with government backup reinsurance. Legislation has not been introduced yet to implement these proposals. More details on proposals can be found in CRS Report R41719, which includes summaries of legislation introduced in the 112th Congress. Most bills address specific concerns, with some focusing on executive compensation. H.R. 31, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas. H.R. 31, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, mandates quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including liabilities, executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation, and underwriting standards. The bill mandates quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including investments, equity investments by Treasury, capital levels, underwriting standards, mortgage buyback policies, and actions affecting enterprise securities. The FHFA inspector general would review the reports and inform Congress, with both reports and comments posted on the FHFA website. The IG would also examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. The bill mandates quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including investments, equity investments by Treasury, capital levels, underwriting standards, mortgage buyback policies, and actions affecting enterprise securities. The FHFA inspector general (IG) would review the reports and inform Congress, with both reports and comments posted on the FHFA website. The IG would also examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. There is some overlap with current reports on capital, investments, and loss mitigation activities. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises of the Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 31 and forwarded it to the full committee. The FHFA's monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report covers loss mitigation efforts. Legislation like H.R. 463 and H.R. 1221 aim to increase transparency and oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 463 would subject the enterprises to FOIA requests, while H.R. 1221 would limit the pay of their employees. No action has been taken on these bills yet. H.R. 463 and H.R. 1221 aim to increase transparency and oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 463 would make the enterprises subject to FOIA requests, while H.R. 1221 would limit the pay of their employees. Executive compensation would be based on profitability, with a maximum pay of $155,500 in 2011. The bill aims to transfer Senior Executive Service salaries to the Treasury and set a maximum pay of $155,500 for enterprise employees based on profitability. It would also enforce TARP provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance, stating that enterprise employees are not federal employees. The House Financial Services Committee ordered the bill to be reported as amended on November 15, 2011, removing FHFA's discretion on rejecting salaries. The Services Committee ordered the bill to be reported as amended, removing FHFA's discretion on rejecting enterprise salaries. H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, would require enterprises to charge a guarantee fee reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. FHFA could phase in the higher fee over two years or impose it at a higher level two years after enactment. The FHFA would have the option to phase in a higher fee over two years or impose it at a higher level two years after enactment. H.R. 1223 aims to ensure equitable treatment of mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises. H.R. 1223, the GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, aims to prohibit treating mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises differently from similar MBS issued by other companies. It requires regulatory determinations on \"qualified residential mortgages\" (QRMs) to not be solely based on the enterprises' role in securitization, as mandated by Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank requires joint regulations from federal banking regulators, the SEC, HUD, and FHFA to implement risk retention requirements for MBS, with QRMs being exempt from this requirement. The GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, H.R. 1223, aims to prevent discrimination against mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises compared to those issued by other companies. Dodd-Frank mandates joint regulations from various agencies to implement risk retention requirements for MBS, with QRMs being exempt. The Federal Reserve's general counsel stated that enterprises are not exempt from the risk retention requirement due to their guarantee structure. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt enterprises from the risk retention requirement, stating their 100% guarantee of MBS payments does not satisfy it. However, proposed rules would allow guarantees to meet requirements during conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224 aims to reduce GSE portfolios to $250 billion each over five years, with Fannie Mae at $789 billion and Freddie Mac at $697 billion in 2010. Treasury-GSE agreements require portfolio reductions to stay under a $900 billion cap. In 2011, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were required to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. The bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 aimed to reduce the portfolios on the same schedule as H.R. 1224, while H.R. 408 and S. 178 proposed a four-year reduction plan. H.R. 1224 did not include delinquent mortgages repurchased to fulfill guarantees in the portfolio limits. Companion bills H.R. 408 and S. 178 aim to reduce portfolios over four years. H.R. 1224 excludes delinquent mortgages repurchased for guarantees from portfolio limits. FHFA could order faster portfolio reductions. H.R. 1225 requires enterprises to seek Treasury permission for new debt issuance. H.R. 1225, GSE Debt Issuance Approval Act of 2011, requires enterprises to request Treasury permission for new debt issuance. The Secretary of the Treasury would announce his decision in writing after a seven-day waiting period. This authority was previously used to prevent large debt issuances close to Treasury sales. Financial Services marked up H.R. 1225, requiring enterprises to seek Treasury approval for new debt issuance. The Secretary of the Treasury could assert existing review authority in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's charters. H.R. 1226, GSE Mission Improvement Act, aims to repeal affordable housing goals established in 1992. H.R. 1226, GSE Mission Improvement Act, would repeal affordable housing goals established in 1992, duty to serve underserved markets, and funding for housing trust fund and capital magnet fund. FHFA would report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans to borrowers in rural areas. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would restrict FHFA from approving new products during conservatorship or receivership of enterprises unless deemed necessary to preserve assets or reduce losses. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would prohibit FHFA from approving new products during conservatorship or receivership of enterprises unless necessary to preserve assets or reduce losses. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1227 and forwarded it to the full committee. FHFA could potentially announce a new policy to restrict new product approvals while the GSEs are in conservatorship. H.R. 2425, Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, would prohibit Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae from purchasing or securitizing mortgages registered with MERS, a system bypassing state laws. Legal challenges question MERS' authority in foreclosures and ownership history. Some employment contracts between enterprises and employees provide for legal expense coverage. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, is also mentioned. Legal challenges question the enterprises' authority in foreclosures and ownership history. Employment contracts provide for legal expense coverage. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, proposes a methodology for determining reasonable legal expenses for employees. H.R. 2436 aims to prevent a reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439 empowers FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, aims to prevent a reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury by the enterprises. H.R. 2439 empowers FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter, allowing for charter revocation at the termination of a limited-life entity created during the receivership process. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, seeks to terminate the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Hope Reserve Fund established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011 aims to terminate housing funds established in 2008 due to financial constraints. Another act directs FHFA to identify non-essential assets for sale by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additionally, a bill sets a maximum bailout amount for Treasury support. FHFA is tasked with identifying non-mission critical assets for potential sale, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to release loan and appraisal data without disclosing personal information. H.R. 2462, the Cap the GSE Bailout Act of 2011, sets a maximum bailout amount for Treasury support to the enterprises. Initially set at $100 billion each, the limit was later raised to $200 billion each, with unlimited support provided in 2010-2012. An amendment allows for additional financial support if the private secondary mortgage market is not viable. The Treasury has contracted to purchase preferred stock for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to keep them solvent, with limits initially set at $100 billion each and later raised to $200 billion each. In 2010-2012, unlimited support was provided, with the $200 billion limits applying outside of those years. Various companion bills have been introduced in Congress with different provisions for the enterprises. Companion bills introduced in the 112th Congress include Title VI of H.R. 408 and S. 178, as well as H.R. 1182 and S. 693. These bills have provisions related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with some differences. H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413 aim to replace the enterprises. Title VI of H.R. 408 and S. 178, known as the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, would terminate the enterprises' conservatorships within 24 months. Other unrelated issues addressed in the bills are not covered in this report. Title VI of H.R. 408 and S. 178 aim to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24 months. After the conservatorship ends, the enterprises would either dissolve or continue under revised charters with changes such as reducing their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. Housing goals would no longer apply to the enterprises. The enterprises in H.R. 1224 would reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years, with no housing goals. Provisions in H.R. 408 and S. 178 for leaving conservatorship within 24-30 months are not included. After returning to stockholder control, the enterprises' charters would be repealed for new business, followed by a 10-year wind-down period and dissolution. FHFA would have strengthened authority over minimum capital requirements. After returning to stockholder control, the enterprises' charters would be repealed for new business, followed by a 10-year wind-down period and dissolution. FHFA would have strengthened authority over minimum capital requirements, setting a nationwide conforming loan limit at $417,000 with no high-cost exceptions. Enterprises could not purchase homes selling for more than the area median home price, and would be prohibited from purchasing mortgages greater than the area median home price. The enterprises, after leaving conservatorship, would have a minimum downpayment requirement of 5% for the first 12 months, 7.5% for the second 12 months, and 10% thereafter. They would also be required to pay all state and local taxes, register all stocks and public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and not purchase mortgages greater than the area median home price.
