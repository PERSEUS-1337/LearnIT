NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION INFORMATION PROGRAMS. The Director will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide industry experience, and utilize distance learning. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition, with funds used to enhance program capabilities. Grants awarded under this program will enhance higher education institutions' information programs through curriculum development, degree/certificate programs, and student recruitment. The grants aim to improve higher education institutions' information programs by developing curriculum, establishing degree/certificate programs, creating research opportunities for students, acquiring necessary equipment, and facilitating collaboration with government agencies, private industry, and academic institutions. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of testbed networks for student use, opportunities for faculty to collaborate with government agencies and industry, partnerships with other academic institutions, student internships, and bridge programs between community colleges and universities. The curr_chunk discusses establishing or enhancing bridge programs in information fields between community colleges and universities, along with other activities determined by the Director to achieve the program's purposes. Institutions of higher education seeking funding must submit an application to the Director as required. Institutions of higher education must submit an application to the Director with details on research and instructional capacity, including the role of each member in a consortium. The application must include a plan for building instructional capacity in information fields, collaborations with government or industry partners, historical student enrollment data, and projections for enrollment and placement. The application must include a plan for building instructional capacity in information fields, collaborations with government or industry partners, historical student enrollment data, projections for enrollment and placement, and a plan to evaluate the success of the proposed program. The Director will ensure grants are awarded in a wide range of geographic areas. The Director will evaluate the program established under this subsection, ensuring grants are awarded in various geographic areas and institutions of higher education. The Director will evaluate the program established under this subsection within 3 years, assessing the impact of grants on increasing students pursuing degrees in information fields. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. The Director shall provide grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 to improve education in information fields.
