    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. The Voting Restoration Act aims to restore voting rights by addressing disparities in voting eligibility standards for ex-felons across different states. Congress asserts its supervisory power over federal elections, emphasizing the right to vote for all citizens as guaranteed by the US Constitution. Different states have varying rules on voting eligibility for ex-felons. While some states prohibit inmates from voting while serving their sentences, others disenfranchise ex-offenders even after completing their sentences. The process to regain voting rights is challenging, requiring a pardon or order from the Governor in some states, or a parole or pardon board action in others. Federal offenders in 16 states must obtain a Presidential pardon to regain their voting rights. Approximately 3,900,000 Americans, or 2 percent of the adult population, are currently ineligible to vote. Approximately 3,900,000 Americans, or 2 percent of the adult population, are currently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. Three-fourths of these individuals are on probation, parole, or are ex-offenders. The number of incarcerated individuals has increased significantly in recent years, with drug offenders making up a large percentage of federal prison inmates. The exponential growth of the prison population is partly due to harsh drug policies enacted by the government. In 1998, 1 in 4 inmates were incarcerated for drug offenses, with drug offenders making up 58% of Federal prison inmates. Racial disparities in sentencing laws have led to African-Americans being disproportionately affected, despite being a minority in the population. Minorities are disproportionately impacted by these laws. The racially disparate sentencing laws for crack and powder cocaine have led to African-Americans being overrepresented in Federal drug convictions. Additionally, minorities are disproportionately affected by laws that strip felons of their voting rights, with 1.4 million African-American men unable to participate in Federal elections. Congress should address these disparities to ensure equal voting rights for all Americans. The purpose of this Act is to restore voting rights to individuals who have completed sentences for criminal offenses and promote their participation in civic life. Congress should address disparities in sentencing laws and voting rights that disproportionately affect minority communities. Protection of right to vote and register in federal elections. The right to vote in federal elections cannot be denied based on a felony conviction, except while under state supervision. Individuals can take legal action if this right is violated. Individuals aggrieved by a violation of the Act can notify the state's chief election official. If the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe, a civil action can be taken for relief. If the violation occurs close to a federal election, legal action can still be pursued. An aggrieved person can bring a civil action in court for relief regarding a violation of the Act. If the violation occurs within 30 days of a federal election, notice to the chief election official is not required to file a civil action. Compensatory damages can be requested for violations occurring within 3 days of a federal election. If a violation of the Act occurs within 3 days of a federal election, a civil action can be brought for compensatory damages. The Attorney General can also take legal action to remedy violations of the Act. SEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM TO ASSIST STATES IN PROTECTING RIGHTS OF EX-FELONS TO VOTE AND REGISTER IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS.
