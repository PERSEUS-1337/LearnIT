    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The article is subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code is required for administration. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application. Entities excluded by specific sections of the California Constitution are not affected if they have an approved retirement plan before January 1, 2013. Additionally, public employees protected under a federal code section are also exempt until a federal court rules otherwise or until January 1, 2016. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application. Public employees specified in subparagraph (A) are exempt if a federal court upholds the Secretary of Labor's determination under Section 5333(b) of Title 49. The article also does not apply to a multiemployer plan authorized by the Taft-Hartley Act if the public employer joined before January 1, 2013, and the plan is regulated by ERISA. The benefit plan required by this article applies to new members as defined in Section 7522.04. The benefit plan required by this article applies to public employees who are new members as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals who were employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and then became employed by a subsequent public employer for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, shall be subject to the retirement plan of the subsequent employer if they were subject to concurrent membership or reciprocity. The defined benefit plan applies to public employees who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, and became subject to a different plan in a different public retirement system. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower cost formula before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that formula. However, if they adopt a new formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the new formula. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a formula that meets specific requirements and is approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet specific requirements, be approved by the Legislature, and have no greater risk or cost than the required defined benefit formula. New members can only join the existing defined contribution plan or a plan that complies with the article's requirements. The Legislature must approve any new defined benefit pension plan or formula adopted by a public employer after January 1, 2013. New members can only join a defined contribution plan that meets the requirements of this article. Employers can offer a defined contribution plan with or without a defined benefit plan after January 1, 2013. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may provide employees with the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the common power being exercised. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the article's requirements. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System is exempt from certain benefit and compensation limitations. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the article's requirements. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System and the Judges\u2019 Retirement System II are exempt from certain benefit and compensation limitations. This article does not provide membership in any public retirement system for ineligible individuals. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
