    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The proposal aimed to amend the Clean Air Act by implementing emission caps on electric utility emissions through a tradeable allowance program. Introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, a modified version (S. 131) was introduced in the 109th Congress by Senator Inhofe. Debate has focused on the cap-and-trade implementation scheme. In the 109th Congress, a modified version of Clear Skies (S. 131) has been introduced by Senator Inhofe and is the focus of congressional hearings. The debate surrounding the Administration's Clear Skies proposal has centered on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme, which aims to deliver guaranteed emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury at a fraction of command and control costs. EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions over the eastern United States under existing Clean Air Act authority. The proposal's cap-and-trade provisions are less significant in terms of the Clean Air Act. EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions. Clear Skies aims to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources. The Clear Skies proposal aims to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources, with the belief that certain CAA provisions are no longer necessary. EPA has used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions. The Clear Skies legislation aims to simplify regulations by combining various aspects of the Clean Air Act into one streamlined process for utilities. This would potentially eliminate the need for New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain regulations. The impact of this legislation on electric generating units and industrial sources is being examined. The report examines the potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act's structure for electric generating units and industrial sources. Changes would affect Title I, with distinctions based on location, age of facility, and fuel type. Regulations for SO2, NOx, and PM vary despite the general regulatory structure. The Clean Air Act's regulatory structure, established in 1970 and expanded in 1977, remains unchanged despite the addition of Title IV in 1990 to control SO2 emissions. The Act's requirements differ based on factors such as facility location, age, and fuel type. The addition of Title IV was a supplemental provision, not a replacement for existing provisions. The Clean Air Act of 1990 did not alter the Act's basic requirements. Title IV was a supplemental provision, not a replacement for existing provisions. The Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and required national emission limits for new polluting facilities. NAAQS are set for six criteria pollutants, including SO2, NOx, and PM, to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. EPA periodically reviews NAAQS based on the most recent health data. The Clean Air Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria pollutants to protect public health. EPA sets primary NAAQS with specific deadlines for compliance, while states are responsible for implementing the standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs). Non-attainment areas require new sources to use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions from increasing. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to require new sources to install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions from increasing. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) set emission limitations for major new stationary sources of air pollution. The Clean Air Act mandates new sources to install LAER technology to prevent emissions increase. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install RACT. NSPS set emission limitations for major new stationary sources. The Act also addresses interstate pollution through regional commissions and state petitions. The Clean Air Act mandates emission controls for new and existing sources in nonattainment areas. Interstate pollution is addressed through regional commissions and state petitions, with the NOx SIP Call being a significant regulatory regime controlling NOx emissions in multiple states. EPA encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to controls determined by this regulatory regimen. Under the Clean Air Act, states are given emission budgets to achieve in any way they choose. EPA successfully encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to controls determined by the state to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are mostly free from controls. Major new sources are subject to NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 CAA added the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program to control ambient concentrations of pollutants like SO2 and NOx. The 1977 Clean Air Act introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program to control ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas. The program allows for some increase in pollution concentrations based on classification, with Class I areas having very little degradation allowed. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review. States can reclassify areas to allow for degradation up to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The Clean Air Act introduced the PSD program to control pollution in clean air areas. Class I areas allow very little degradation, while Class II areas allow moderate degradation. States can reclassify areas to Class III, permitting degradation up to NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas undergo preconstruction review and must install BACT. State agencies determine BACT case-by-case, ensuring it is at least as stringent as federal NSPS. Regional haze program complements PSD for existing sources. The regional haze program complements the PSD program by focusing on visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas due to air pollution. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 must install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART). The EPA implemented a regional haze program in 1999, requiring more stringent controls on NOx and SO2 emissions for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. Table 1 outlines the current air quality control requirements for these facilities under Title I of the Clean Air Act. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 are required to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. In 1999, the EPA implemented a regional haze program for more stringent controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. The Clean Air Act establishes a federal regulatory program for 188 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), including mercury, with two phases of control measures. The first phase involves Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources, determined by the EPA Administrator. In the second phase of the Clean Air Act's control measures for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), additional regulations may be implemented to address any \"residual risks\" from HAPs after the initial MACT standards. Electric utilities received special treatment under Section 112, requiring EPA to report on public health hazards from their emissions before issuing MACT standards. EPA made the necessary findings in 2000, but proposed changes in 2004. Under Section 112(n), the Clean Air Act required EPA to report to Congress on public health hazards from electric generating units' emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and determine if regulation under Section 112 is necessary. EPA initially found regulation necessary in 2000 but proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 in 2004. States can enforce stricter HAP standards than federal regulations. Under current law, states can enforce stricter standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations. Some states have already implemented more stringent standards. Clear Skies proposes changes to current regulations, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and the extension and revision of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2. Clear Skies proposes changes to current regulations, including new national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and modifications to existing authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Additional authorities include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, national emission standards for electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to join the cap-and-trade program. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include new cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension of the Title IV program for SO2, and modifications to hazardous air pollutant regulations. Additional authorities involve national emission standards for electric generating units and the option for sources in other industries to participate in cap-and-trade programs. Removed or limited authorities include provisions for major sources, changes to hazardous air pollutant regulations, and a moratorium on petitions to control emissions under Section 126. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include new cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension of the Title IV program for SO2, and modifications to hazardous air pollutant regulations. Changes include removing utilities and opt-in units from major sources, establishing a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, reducing noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preempting more stringent state requirements for NOx and mercury, eliminating NSR for major source modifications, and eliminating BART requirements for visibility protection. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and mercury, preempting state requirements for NOx and mercury, eliminating NSR for major source modifications, and establishing a 50 km zone for PSD requirements around Class I areas. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act with a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program. Phase 1 would establish caps for EGUs of 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps would be introduced in S. 131. The proposal under S. 131 includes caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases, with trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 sets caps for EGUs at 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances are allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors like fuel type. The Clear Skies proposal includes caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases with trading programs for flexibility. Allowances are allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors like fuel type. The proposal also establishes more stringent statutory standards for emissions from new and reconstructed EGUs compared to current NSPS. The National Emission Standards for emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs are more stringent than current NSPS. Standards include 1.0 lb/MWh for coal-fired EGUs for NOx and 0.20 lb/MWh for particulate matter. The Hg standard is 0.015 lb/GWh. The standards would be reviewed every eight years. The National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from non-utility sources allow units to opt into a cap-and-trade program. Units would receive allocations based on their emissions and output, with reductions in baseline emissions starting in 2010. The proposal offers alternative methods for determining allowances for units based on their emissions and output. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would receive allocations equal to a percentage of their baseline emissions for SO2, NOx, and mercury. They would also be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations and could be permanently exempt if EPA accepts their application. Opt-in units would also be relieved from major source classification for 20 years, provided they meet pollution control requirements. ClearSkies would establish an optional \"Transitional Area\" category in place of nonattainment designations for new ozone and PM 2.5 standards, allowing areas to be designated as transitional if they are projected to meet the standards by December 31, 2015. EPA modeling shows that a significant number of nonattainment counties could qualify for this transitional status. The Clear Skies proposal introduces a \"Transitional Area\" category to replace nonattainment designations for new ozone and PM 2.5 standards. EPA modeling indicates that many nonattainment counties could qualify for this transitional status, extending deadlines for reaching attainment and removing statutory requirements until after 2017. Additionally, affected units would be exempt from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment. Units not near Class I areas are exempt from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements. Units near Class I areas remain subject to PSD requirements. Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment. Units near Class I areas remain subject to PSD requirements. Nonattainment areas would be exempt from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements under Clear Skies. The Clear Skies proposal exempts existing affected units from major source requirements for 20 years. Changes to the Hazardous Air Pollutant Provisions of Section 112 would preclude regulation of certain pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants based on public health concerns. The Administrator would retain the authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units based on public health concerns. Any determination to impose controls would need to be based on a peer-reviewed study and could not take effect before January 1, 2018. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for certain hazardous air pollutant regulations. Changes proposed in the Clear Skies Act include exemptions for units opting into the cap-and-trade program from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations. A moratorium on Section 126 petitions would be established, with stricter requirements for acceptance after the moratorium. The amendment to the Clear Skies Act includes stricter requirements for accepting Section 126 petitions related to air pollution from upwind sources. The Administrator cannot require submission of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) subjecting affected units to Section 126 requirements before December 31, 2014. The Administrator must consider emissions reductions needed for attainment when reviewing a Section 126 petition. The amendment to the Clear Skies Act sets stricter requirements for Section 126 petitions regarding air pollution from upwind sources. The Administrator cannot demand SIPs for affected units before December 31, 2014. When reviewing a petition, the Administrator must consider required emissions reductions for attainment and ensure that reductions from affected units are cost-effective and improve air quality in nonattainment areas. Affected units must be cost-effective and improve air quality in nonattainment areas as per the Clear Skies Act. Noncompliance penalties for sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced under the new legislation, with a fixed penalty of $2,000 per ton set in 2008. The Clear Skies Act reduces noncompliance penalties for sulfur dioxide emissions to a fixed $2,000 per ton in 2008, without inflation adjustments. States are prohibited from interfering with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances under the cap-and-trade programs. The Clear Skies Act prohibits states from imposing stricter limits than those in the bill, allowing increased emissions in other jurisdictions. It also exempts EGUs from NSR for 20 years. The Clear Skies Act prohibits states from imposing stricter limits than those in the bill, allowing increased emissions in other jurisdictions. It also exempts EGUs from NSR for 20 years and establishes National Emission Standards for new EGUs. Reconstruction of units is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost of a new unit. The standards for modifications under NSR do not apply if the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50% of the cost to construct a comparable new unit. There is no specific cost criterion for modifications, but a 20% threshold proposed by the EPA in 2003 was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. BART requirements for major sources in operation between 1962 and 1977 are eliminated under Section 169A of the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals stayed the EPA's proposed 20% cost threshold for modifications under NSR. Clear Skies would exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years. S. 131 would subject affected units near Class I areas to PSD requirements for new construction or reconstruction. S. 131 would subject affected units near Class I areas to PSD requirements for new construction or reconstruction within 50 km, while exempting units in Class II areas from additional emission controls. Under the PSD program, Class II areas can moderately increase ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM without needing to offset emissions. Clear Skies would exempt affected units in Class II areas from further emission controls. Additionally, Clear Skies would create a new \"transitional\" area classification for nonattainment areas to demonstrate attainment of ozone and PM2.5 standards by December 2015, avoiding penalties until then. Clear Skies would create a new \"transitional\" area classification for nonattainment areas to demonstrate attainment of ozone and PM2.5 standards by December 2015, avoiding penalties until then. After 2015, areas failing to achieve the standard would be designated nonattainment by June 2017 and required to impose controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas would be exempt from statutory requirements until 2017. The Clean Air Act outlines specific requirements for areas classified in various levels of ozone nonattainment, including standards for new stationary sources, existing sources, motor vehicles, gas stations, and penalties for non-compliance. EPA proposed to maintain these requirements for areas that fail to meet the ozone standard. The Clean Air Act sets requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including regulations for stationary sources, motor vehicles, gas stations, and penalties for non-compliance. EPA proposed to maintain these requirements for areas failing to meet the ozone standard, with a possibility for transitional areas to roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. The proposed Clear Skies legislation aims to reclassify most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" allowing them to roll back statutory requirements until 2018. This would eliminate the need for conformity in transportation projects until 2018. The legislation also includes changes to Title I regarding electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. The Clear Skies legislation proposes reclassifying most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" exempting them from conformity requirements until 2018. It includes structural changes to Title I for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program, eliminating location as a variable for controlling EGUs. The emission limitations and allowance system under Clear Skies are not dependent on the EGU's location or state/local government restrictions on trading. The Clear Skies legislation eliminates location as a factor for controlling electric generating units (EGUs) and their emission limitations. This includes allowing the allowance system to operate regardless of an EGU's location or state/local government restrictions on trading. Additionally, under Clear Skies, states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated, along with the enforcement mechanism NSR for EGUs covered by the legislation. Under Clear Skies, states would lose the ability to restrict trading by EGUs in nonattainment areas, impacting their influence on emissions. The enforcement mechanism NSR would also be eliminated for EGUs covered by the legislation. States setting stringent standards would not have full control, as restrictions on allowance trading could lead to extra allowances being sold to upwind utilities. Additionally, states would be unable to prevent the sale or force neighboring utilities to reduce emissions through a Section 126 petition. Under Clear Skies, state legislation aimed at achieving attainment could lead to extra allowances being sold to upwind utilities. States would be unable to prevent the sale or force neighboring utilities to reduce emissions through a Section 126 petition until after 2014. Clear Skies aims to eliminate the need for stronger state and local standards by designating areas as transitional if they are projected to meet air quality standards by December 2015. Clear Skies establishes a \"transitional\" designation for areas projected to meet air quality standards by December 2015, avoiding the need for additional controls. It also aims to protect Class I areas and restricts states' ability to enforce stronger standards. Clear Skies aims to protect Class I areas and restrict states' ability to enforce stronger standards. The distinction over EGU age remains unresolved, with Title I and Title IV of the CAA imposing stricter requirements on new sources. Clear Skies would reduce this disparity by setting up allowance reserves for new sources, with more generous allocation formulas for existing sources. Clear Skies aims to reduce the disparity between new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. Existing sources would have more generous allocation formulas, giving them an advantage over new facilities. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. New and existing Electric Generating Units (EGUs) would no longer be subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards or residual risk standards. This absence of unit-specific standards could make it challenging to address areas with high concentrations of mercury. States could choose to implement more stringent standards under their own Clean Air Act. The absence of unit-specific standards under the cap-and-trade program could make it difficult to address areas with high mercury concentrations. States could set more stringent standards under their own Clean Air Act, but these standards would not completely control allowance trading. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from Electric Generating Units under certain conditions. The state cannot prevent the utility from selling to upwind utilities not covered by legislation. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under stringent conditions, including a peer-reviewed study on public health concerns. Former Administrator Whitman highlights the central issue of Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies will not achieve the 8-hour ozone or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would effectively remove additional electric utility control options available to states to achieve NAAQS standards. EPA's analysis indicates that some nonattainment areas will need additional controls and time to reach attainment. The opt-in provision in Clear Skies makes its reach unclear. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would limit states' control options to achieve NAAQS standards and could reduce state and local authorities' ability to address mercury contamination from electric utilities. Clear Skies proposal would limit state control options for reducing mercury contamination from electric utilities, arguing for cost-effective reductions despite extended compliance deadlines. The Clear Skies proposal aims to achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act. Compliance deadlines under Clear Skies are extended, allowing states more time to meet air quality standards. However, early reductions in a cap-and-trade program can be offset by later increases in emissions, complicating compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
