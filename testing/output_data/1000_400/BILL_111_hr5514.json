The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to states annually for various purposes such as health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. States receive this funding through grants, loans, and other means, but some states are more effective than others in utilizing these taxpayer dollars. Every state receives federal funding for common activities like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. Some states are more efficient in spending taxpayer dollars. Activity-based total accountability can show which states are most effective, leading to competition and serving as models for efficiency. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings using total accountability measures, including unit-cost data. States demonstrating efficiency with tax dollars will serve as models for others to ensure accountability and value for taxpayers. State governments receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15 days before the end of the Federal fiscal year. The report should include a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary. The Director is required to publish these reports on their website within 30 days of receiving them. SEC. 4. STANDARDIZATION OF STATE FISCAL ACCOUNTING REPORTS. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison purposes. States must submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A classification system will be based on submitted descriptions and relevant data. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities based on program descriptions and relevant data, including data from the most recent census. This system will identify conduct for completed instances of agency activities. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities and identifying conduct for completed instances of agency activities. Performance measures for each agency activity will also be identified and linked electronically in reports. SEC. 5. UNIT-COST SUMMARY. Each unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government shall be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE. A statement of funds available shall identify each source of funds available for expenditure by the budget entity and the sum of all amounts. Sources include State appropriations laws, Federal financial assistance, and other sources determined appropriate by the Director. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. The agency activity line item listing must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. It should also describe conduct for activity units, purposes, and intended beneficiaries. The agency activity line item listing must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost, as well as describe conduct, purposes, and intended beneficiaries. Special rules for determining expenditures include allocation for activities without measurable accomplishments and payments to contractors or subordinate entities. The unit-cost of an agency activity must be determined using a specific formula. Payments to contractors or subordinate entities must be included in the total amount of funds expended by a budget entity. The unit-cost of an agency activity is determined by a formula involving UC, m, and q. This formula is used for reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures. The reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures involves identifying adjusted expenditures and explaining any differences with the sum of all available funds. Adjusted expenditures are determined by the formula AE = EXP + PT + REV. The formula AE = EXP + PT + REV defines adjusted expenditures, where EXP is total expenditures, PT is pass-throughs, and REV is reversions. Pass-throughs and reversions are identified based on criteria set by the Director. Noncompliance is addressed in Section 9. SEC. 9. NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\nIf the Director finds a State government failed to submit a timely fiscal report, 10% of federal financial assistance will be withheld for the following year.\n\nSEC. 10. RULES.\n\nThe Director can create necessary rules for implementing this Act.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe Director can establish rules to implement the Act, defining terms like \"State government,\" \"budget entity,\" \"agency activity,\" and \"Federal financial assistance.\""
