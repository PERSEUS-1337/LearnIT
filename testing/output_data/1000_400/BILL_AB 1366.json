    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature aims to boost enrollment and graduation rates for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540 by mandating the establishment of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, empowering them in a safe environment to increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Several college campuses, including UCLA, UC Davis, CSU Los Angeles, CSU Fullerton, and CSU Northridge, have established Dream Resource Centers to support undocumented students. These centers offer workshops, legal clinics, information on available programs, and peer mentoring to enhance awareness of resources and increase employment opportunities. Additionally, a new chapter in the Education Code will further support students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code to encourage California Community Colleges to designate Dream Resource Liaisons on campuses to assist students meeting specific requirements with access to financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus is encouraged to have a staff person knowledgeable in these areas, particularly for undocumented students, placed in the extended opportunity programs and services office or financial aid office. The California State University campuses are encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. The University of California is also encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services such as financial aid assistance, academic counseling, peer support, psychological counseling, referral services, and legal services. The University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus.
