    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and includes findings and purpose. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving design and production. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the US. To maximize benefits, the US must maintain leadership in nanotechnology despite global competition. Foreign students on temporary visas earned 32 percent of all science degrees. To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the United States must invest in educating its students in secondary schools and higher education. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in 2003, with many intending to return to their home countries after completing their studies. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the United States must invest in educating its students in secondary schools and higher education. This Act aims to strengthen the capacity of US schools and institutions for this purpose. The Act aims to provide grants to secondary schools and higher education institutions to enhance their capacity in preparing students for careers in nanotechnology by providing necessary tools, including scanning electron microscopes. Training will be provided to teachers and professors to utilize these tools effectively in the classroom and laboratory. The Act aims to provide grants to schools and universities for nanotechnology education, including training teachers to use scanning electron microscopes effectively. The Act defines \"eligible institution\" as a school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year institution of higher education. The Act defines \"eligible institution\" as a school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year institution of higher education. The terms \"institution of higher education\", \"secondary school\", and \"Secretary\" have specific meanings. \"Qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50 percent domestic materials. Qualified nanotechnology equipment for teaching in the classroom must be manufactured in the United States with at least 50 percent domestic materials. The program authorized under Section 4 requires qualified nanotechnology equipment for classroom teaching to be made in the US with at least 50 percent domestic materials. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to provide grants up to $150,000 to eligible institutions for teaching nanotechnology. Activities supported include acquiring equipment and software, and providing educational services for students and faculty. The National Science Foundation will provide grants up to $150,000 to institutions for teaching nanotechnology. The funds can be used to acquire equipment and software, offer educational services for students and faculty, and provide teacher education and certification for technology skills related to nanotechnology in the classroom. Not more than 1/4 of the grant amount can be used for specific purposes. The National Science Foundation offers grants up to $150,000 for institutions to teach nanotechnology. Funds can be used for equipment, software, educational services, and teacher education. Limitations include using only 1/4 of the grant for specific purposes and restricting funds to undergraduate programs in community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligible institutions must submit an application for grant consideration. The Act provides grants for undergraduate programs in community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligible institutions must submit an application for grant consideration to the Director within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications and selecting institutions to receive grants. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications and selecting eligible institutions to receive grants under the Act, prioritizing geographically diverse locations and historically Black colleges and universities. The Director will prioritize geographically diverse locations, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions for grants under the Act. Eligible institutions must agree to a matching requirement for incurred costs. The Director prioritizes diverse locations, historically Black colleges, and minority institutions for grants. Eligible institutions must agree to a matching requirement for program costs, with a waiver available for those with low endowments. The Director prioritizes diverse locations, historically Black colleges, and minority institutions for grants. Eligible institutions must agree to a matching requirement for program costs, with a waiver available for those with low endowments. The waiver includes institutions with no endowment or an endowment below $5,000,000. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 are ineligible for another grant for 2 years, while other eligible institutions face the same restriction. Eligible institutions receiving grants over $100,000 are ineligible for another grant for 2 years under this Act. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on grant fund usage within 1 year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year. The evaluation will assess the impact of the grants on students, faculty, and staff. Additionally, a report to Congress must be made within 6 months after evaluation. The Director shall assess the impact of grants on students, faculty, and staff of institutions receiving grants under this Act. A report to Congress with recommendations must be submitted within 6 months after evaluation. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
