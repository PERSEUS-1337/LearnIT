    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007\". Congress recognizes the seriousness of alien smuggling as a transnational crime that threatens border integrity, national sovereignty, and security. They commend the efforts of law enforcement agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice in combating this threat. Alien smuggling is a serious transnational crime that threatens border integrity and security. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, along with law enforcement agencies, play crucial roles in combating this threat. State and local authorities, medical personnel, social service providers, and the faith community also contribute to addressing alien smuggling in border communities. Existing penalties for alien smuggling are insufficient to provide appropriate punishment for alien smugglers. Current laws often fail to reach the conduct of alien smugglers, transporters, recruiters, guides, and boat captains. Laws concerning failure to heave to are also inadequate in punishing boat operators and crew who engage in reckless transportation of aliens on the high seas. Alien smuggling rings operate outside the US, requiring extraterritorial jurisdiction for justice. Smuggling can involve dangerous conditions risking injury or death. The Department of Homeland Security will check alien smugglers and smuggled individuals against terrorist watchlists at U.S. borders. Additionally, there will be stronger prosecution and punishment for alien smugglers. Section 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to address the smuggling of unlawful and terrorist aliens. This includes bringing individuals to the United States without lawful authority and recruiting or encouraging them to enter or reside in the country. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to address the smuggling of unlawful and terrorist aliens, including bringing individuals to the United States without lawful authority, recruiting or encouraging them to enter or reside in the country, transporting them within the US, and harboring or concealing them. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to address the smuggling of unlawful and terrorist aliens, including bringing individuals to the United States without lawful authority, recruiting or encouraging them to enter or reside in the country, transporting them within the US, and harboring or concealing them. Violators of this act face punishment as provided in subparagraph (C) for each alien involved in the violation. Violators of the Immigration and Nationality Act face punishment as provided in subparagraph (C) for each alien involved in the violation, including fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both. Additional penalties apply if the offense involves the transit of certain family members or is committed for profit or commercial advantage. If the offense involves violations of specific paragraphs for profit or commercial advantage, the individual may face fines or imprisonment up to 10 years. Additionally, if the offense involves bringing an individual into the US with the intent for them to commit a serious offense, the penalty may include fines or imprisonment for more than 1 year. If the offense involves private financial gain or bringing someone into the US to commit a serious offense, the penalty may include fines, imprisonment up to 15 years, or up to 20 years if serious bodily injury occurs. The penalty for offenses resulting in serious bodily injury or endangering lives includes fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or up to 30 years if terrorist activity is involved. The penalty for offenses involving serious bodily injury or endangering lives includes fines, imprisonment up to 30 years, or both. Additionally, if the offense involves kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, attempted murder, or similar offenses, the penalty may include life imprisonment. The extraterritorial jurisdiction over offenses described in paragraph (1) includes no defense based on necessity for violations on the high seas. On the high seas, no defense of necessity can be raised in a prosecution for certain violations unless the defendant reported to the Coast Guard and did not facilitate illegal entry of aliens. The text discusses the prohibition of intentionally facilitating the entry of aliens into the United States without lawful authority, except in cases of danger to the alien's life. It also mentions a defense for religious organizations that encourage aliens present in the US to work as ministers or missionaries. Religious organizations in the United States can invite aliens to work as ministers or missionaries as volunteers, without compensation, as long as they have been a member of the denomination for at least one year. The term 'United States' includes various territories and states.

The term 'United States' includes various territories and states. The term 'lawful authority' refers to permission, authorization, or waiver provided for in immigration laws, excluding any obtained through fraud or violation of the law. SEC. 5. MARITIME LAW ENFORCEMENT. Penalties for intentionally violating section 2237 of title 18, United States Code include fines or imprisonment up to 5 years. For offenses related to specific violations, the offender may face fines or imprisonment up to 10 years. If the offense involves serious bodily injury, inhumane transportation conditions, death, kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempted murder, the offender may face fines, imprisonment up to 15 years, or both under title 18, United States Code. In cases involving death, kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempted murder, offenders may be fined or imprisoned under title 18, United States Code. Defense based on necessity is limited in such prosecutions. In prosecutions for violations, a necessity defense can only be raised if the defendant promptly delivers the person in need to authorities, reports to the Coast Guard, and did not facilitate illegal entry of an alien unless there were life-threatening circumstances. The term 'transportation under inhumane conditions' is defined as the transportation of persons in an engine compartment, as per an amendment to Section 2237(e) of title 18, United States Code. The term 'transportation under inhumane conditions' is defined as the transportation of persons in an engine compartment, storage compartment, or other confined space, transportation at an excessive speed, transportation of a number of persons in excess of the rated capacity of the means of transportation, or intentionally grounding a vessel in which persons are being transported. SEC. 6. AMENDMENT TO THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend sentencing guidelines for alien smuggling offenses and obstruction of boarding. Considerations include enhancements for repeated violations, involvement in organized crime, and transportation of groups of 10 or more aliens. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend sentencing guidelines for alien smuggling offenses, considering factors such as repeated violations, involvement in organized crime, transportation of groups of 10 or more aliens, endangerment of lives, and facilitation of terrorist activity. The Commission may use expedited procedures for these guidelines or amendments. The Sentencing Act of 1987 will be applied to alien smuggling offenses, with the authority under the Act extended. The House of Representatives passed this on May 22, 2007."
