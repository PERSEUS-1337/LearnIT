The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to grow to 1 billion by 2008. The number of certified large air carriers has decreased, with 6 major carriers forming 3 large networks. Many communities have lost scheduled air service, and smaller airlines now serve half of those remaining. Only 2/3 of communities in the US with scheduled air service in 1978 still have it today, with half of those served by smaller airlines feeding hub airports. A 1997 report showed 75 city pairs with fares increasing by 30% or more, leading to a decrease in total traffic. A 1998 study found that large US air carriers charge twice as much at hub airports without low fare competition compared to those with low fare competitors. The General Accounting Office found that large US air carriers charge significantly higher fares at hub airports without low fare competition compared to those with low fare competitors. Complaints about airline travel have increased by over 25% from the previous year, with a notable rise in complaints against large US air carriers.
