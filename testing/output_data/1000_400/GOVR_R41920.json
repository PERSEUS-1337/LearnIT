    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism matters. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating provisions from S. 1253 to resolve disputes. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating provisions from S. 1253 to resolve disputes over detainee provisions. The White House has criticized aspects of the bill and threatened to veto any legislation that challenges the President's authorities in collecting intelligence and prosecuting terrorist suspects. The Administration strongly opposes any provision that limits the President's authority in collecting intelligence, incapacitating terrorists, and protecting the nation. The House and Senate bills aim to confirm and possibly expand the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11. The House and Senate bills aim to confirm and possibly expand the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11, in line with the Authorization for Use of Military Force. Many captured individuals have been placed in preventive detention during U.S. operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere. In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, individuals involved have been detained to prevent future acts of terrorism. Some have faced trial in military commissions or civilian courts. The President has the authority to detain enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, as recognized in the Hamdi v. Rumsfeld case. In response to the 9/11 attacks, individuals have been detained to prevent terrorism. The President can detain enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, as established in the Hamdi v. Rumsfeld case. Subsequent legal challenges have mainly occurred in the D.C. Circuit, with rulings generally favoring the government's position on detention policy. Most judicial activity on U.S. detention policy has focused on Guantanamo detainees' habeas petitions in the D.C. Circuit. Court rulings have mostly supported the government's interpretation of its detention authority under the AUMF. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and endorse or reject them. Congress has not passed any laws to clarify the AUMF's detention authority, but the D.C. Circuit has considered post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance. The D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation for guidance on detention authority. In 2010, they concluded that the government can detain those associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, as well as those who support them in hostilities. Most detainees under the AUMF are combatants. The Military Commissions Acts of 2006 and 2009 authorize the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including those who support them in hostilities. Most detainees are combatants captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or Parwan, Afghanistan. These facilities may not be viable for future captures outside of Afghanistan. The CIA initially held \"high value\" Guantanamo detainees at other locations for interrogation. Parwan, Afghanistan, holds a larger number of detainees captured in Afghanistan. Persons arrested in the US for terrorist activity have been prosecuted in federal court, not placed in military detention. The Bush Administration transferred some US citizens arrested in the US into military custody as \"enemy combatants.\" The Bush Administration transferred US citizens arrested in the US into military custody as \"enemy combatants\" for criminal activity, but they were ultimately transferred back to civil authorities and tried in federal court. The detainees, suspected of terrorist activities, were transferred back to civil authorities for trial in federal court amid legal uncertainty. Controversy surrounds the handling of suspected terrorists, with debates on military vs. civilian custody for trials. Debates continue over whether suspected terrorists should be held in military custody and tried before a military commission or transferred to civilian law enforcement for trial in an Article III court. Some argue for executive discretion in deciding the appropriate handling method for each case. This disagreement is common in high-profile cases involving suspected terrorists. Congress passed funding restrictions in response to the Obama Administration's plans to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial in civilian courts. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 extended this prohibition through FY2012, limiting executive discretion on detainee transfers. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial in civilian courts through FY2012. This restriction effectively makes trial by military commission the only option for prosecuting Guantanamo detainees. Other instances of apprehending terrorist suspects by US authorities have also garnered attention. The detention of Guantanamo detainees continues without civilian court trials. Attention has been focused on the apprehension of terrorist suspects by US military and civilian authorities, with debates over whether suspects should be held in military or civilian custody. Controversy surrounds the handling of suspects like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and Faisal Shahzad. The controversy surrounding the detention of terrorist suspects by US authorities, including debates over military vs. civilian custody, has led to criticism of the Administration's handling of cases like Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda, with provisions reaffirming the conflict, imposing restrictions on detainee transfers, and requiring foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses to be tried by military commission. The White House issued a statement supporting most aspects of the bill. The 2012 NDAA addresses detainee matters, including the release of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries and trying foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses by military commission. The White House supports most aspects of the bill but criticizes provisions related to detainee matters, threatening to veto any version challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 authorizes detention of certain persons and requires military detention for some, regulating status determinations and periodic review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees. S. 1253, reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee in June 2011, authorized detention of certain persons, required military detention for some, regulated status determinations and periodic review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees. After objections from the White House and Senate committees, a revised version of the bill, S. 1867, was reported in November 2011 with updated detainee provisions. The Department of Defense and the White House have raised concerns about the revised provisions. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a new version of the bill, S. 1867, on November 15, 2011, with revised detainee provisions. The Department of Defense and the White House objected to the revised provisions. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with an amendment clarifying detainee authority. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with an amendment clarifying detainee authority, replacing the original language with provisions of S. 1867. Differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill will be considered in conference. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities regarding detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA is addressed. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF and current practices for status determinations and reviews are discussed. The FY2012 NDAA addresses detainee matters, including detention authority under the AUMF and current practices for status determinations and reviews. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF is not clearly defined and can be subject to differing interpretations. The Obama Administration framed its detention authority under the AUMF in a court brief in 2009. The Obama Administration defined its detention authority under the AUMF in a 2009 court brief, stating that the President has the power to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, as well as those who supported Taliban or Al Qaeda forces engaged in hostilities against the US or its allies. The scope of this authority is open to interpretation. The President's authority to detain individuals involved in 9/11, Taliban, or Al Qaeda forces is defined under the AUMF. Questions arise regarding the inclusion of \"associated forces\" and the extent of \"substantial support\" in the detention authority claimed by the executive. The Supreme Court's interpretation in Hamdi references law of war principles, leading to debates on indefinite detention. The executive's claimed detention authority under the AUMF raises questions about the inclusion of \"associated forces\" and the definition of \"substantial support.\" The Supreme Court's interpretation in Hamdi, based on law of war principles, has led to debates on indefinite detention. The government has not clarified the specifics of these aspects of detention authority. The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority under the AUMF includes \"substantial support\" as a requirement, similar to the Bush Administration's definition of \"enemy combatant.\" Recent court decisions have focused on proving detainee affiliation with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority scope since 2004. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority scope since at least 2004, with recent court decisions focusing on proving detainee affiliation with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The AUMF does not limit the covered organizations to just Al Qaeda or the Taliban, as many different private armed groups in Afghanistan trained and fought alongside them. The AUMF does not limit covered organizations to just Al Qaeda or the Taliban, allowing for detention of individuals associated with various armed groups in Afghanistan. This authority extends to individuals who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in a traditional international armed conflict. The Bush Administration's position on detaining Chinese Uighur dissidents as members of an \"associated force\" in Guantanamo is consistent with this interpretation. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court accepted the government's test for membership in an \"associated force\" but found the evidence lacking to support the affiliation with al Qaida or the Taliban and engagement in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court accepted the government's test for membership in an \"associated force\" but found the evidence lacking to support the affiliation with al Qaida or the Taliban and engagement in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, but the court did not find sufficient evidence to support this claim. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" It found insufficient evidence to support the claim that ETIM is closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, as required for classification as an \"associated force.\" The court did not find sufficient evidence to classify ETIM as an \"associated force\" with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted in habeas cases to cover armed groups assisting Al Qaeda or the Taliban in Afghanistan. Membership in groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" has been considered an \"associated force\" under the AUMF. The AUMF has been interpreted to include armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan as \"associated forces.\" This includes groups like Zubayda's militia and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (HIG). The detention of individuals associated with armed forces defending the Taliban has also been affirmed. The Administration has suggested that groups outside of Afghanistan may also be considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The Circuit affirmed the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade, a force defending the Taliban. There is uncertainty about the AUMF's authority for detaining individuals captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi did not address this issue. The AUMF permits detention of individuals with ties to the U.S. or U.S. citizens. The U.S. Court of Appeals has authorized detention of those linked to Al Qaeda, even if captured outside Afghanistan. The Fourth Circuit upheld detention of a U.S. citizen and resident alien as enemy combatants. The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals connected to the U.S. or U.S. citizens, including non-U.S. citizens captured outside the country. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien designated as enemy combatants. The establishment of Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) by the Pentagon in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 remains unsettled regarding the circumstances of detention for individuals captured or arrested in the United States. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 to determine detainee status at Guantanamo. CSRTs confirmed 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009, allowing for transfer or other actions based on international obligations and U.S. foreign policy. The process has been largely inactive since 2007 due to fewer detainees brought to Guantanamo. The CSRT process confirmed the status of 539 enemy combatants at Guantanamo between 2004 and 2009. It has been largely inactive since 2007, but any new detainees brought to Guantanamo would likely go through a CSRT. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have a different review process with fewer rights. Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court. Non-citizen detainees held by the United States in Afghanistan have fewer procedural rights compared to Guantanamo detainees. The Supreme Court allows Guantanamo detainees to challenge their detention in federal court, but this privilege has not been extended to detainees in Afghanistan. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy, leading to a pause in military commission and administrative review board proceedings at Guantanamo. The Obama Administration established task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. Military commission and review board proceedings at Guantanamo were put on hold while awaiting recommendations. A new review system was implemented for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. Executive Order 13567 was issued in 2011 for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 to establish a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for assessing the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The PRB determines if detention is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the US security. If continued detention is not warranted, the Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for ensuring a vigorous process. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo. If detention is not deemed necessary, efforts will be made to transfer detainees outside the US. An initial review must occur within a year, allowing detainees to challenge their detention. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for assessing detainee cases at Guantanamo. Detainees can challenge their detention within a year of the order, with periodic reviews thereafter. Congressional concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorism have led to limits on transfers. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for assessing detainee cases at Guantanamo. Concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorism have led to limits on transfers, requiring certification of measures to prevent them from returning to the battlefield. Statistics on post-release activities are classified, but some detainees have been involved in terrorist activities after release, sparking debate on the significance and policy implications. Some detainees have engaged in terrorist activities after their release from Guantanamo, sparking debate on the policy implications. The Pentagon estimated that 30 former detainees had participated in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda. These numbers were challenged by researchers at Seton Hall University. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged the Pentagon's estimate that 30 former Guantanamo detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda. They identified discrepancies in the data and questioned the classification of these activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement.\" The researchers also noted a lack of identifying information for independent verification of the numbers. The Pentagon's assertion that former Guantanamo detainees engaged in terrorist activities was challenged by researchers at Seton Hall University. They questioned the classification of these activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement\" due to discrepancies in the data. The study noted that some individuals did engage in deadly activities post-release, with reports from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon confirming cases of ex-detainees returning to terrorism. In 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. The report in December 2010 stated that 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% were suspected of engaging in terrorism. The report released in December 2010 assessed the likelihood of Guantanamo detainees engaging in terrorism. Out of 598 transferred detainees, 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. 150 confirmed or suspected recidivist detainees were identified, with 13 dead, 54 in custody, and 83 at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 confirmed and 3 suspected detainees participated in terrorist activities. The report does not include detainees based solely on anti-U.S. statements, but the accuracy of the numbers has been challenged. The report released in December 2010 assessed the likelihood of Guantanamo detainees engaging in terrorism. Out of 598 transferred detainees, 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 confirmed and 3 suspected detainees participated in terrorist activities. The accuracy of the numbers has been challenged, with estimates suggesting a higher percentage of released detainees posing a threat. The discrepancy between the report's estimate of detainee recidivism numbers and publicly available sources remains unexplained. The DNI's report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism numbers remains classified, causing discrepancies with publicly available estimates. Despite challenges to the accuracy of the data, there is agreement that released detainees engaging in terrorism has increased. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens held by the Department of Defense after March 7, 2011. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" in Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 refers to non-U.S. citizens held by the Department of Defense after March 7, 2011, who are not U.S. citizens or members of the U.S. Armed Forces. It includes detainees under the effective control of the Department of Defense, even if not in its physical custody. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" under H.R. 1540 includes non-U.S. citizens held by the Department of Defense after March 7, 2011, who are not U.S. citizens or members of the U.S. Armed Forces. It covers detainees under the effective control of the Department of Defense, even if not in its physical custody. The term may encompass situations where detainees are technically under another agency's custody but still supervised by the Department of Defense. It is broad enough to include foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for reasons unrelated to hostilities, such as foreign refugees intercepted at sea and taken to the Migrant Operations Center at the Naval Station. Executive authorities may not apply the provisions of H.R. 1540 regarding Guantanamo detainees to foreign refugees. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. Currently, the Act only permits the death penalty if all commission members vote to convict and agree on the death sentence. This has led to the interpretation that the death penalty cannot be imposed in cases where the accused pleads guilty. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. The amendment permits the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, as long as the military commission panel members vote unanimously to approve the sentence. Additionally, pre-trial agreements can now allow for a reduction in the maximum sentence, but a sentence of death cannot be imposed by a military judge alone. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and other entities, identifying parties to the conflict and affirming the AUMF grants authority. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty with unanimous approval. Pre-trial agreements can reduce maximum sentences, but not impose death by a military judge alone. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, affirming the AUMF grants authority to detain belligerents for the duration of hostilities. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, affirming the President's authority to use necessary force and detain belligerents until the end of hostilities. This provision is the most controversial in the bill. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents in support of a nation, organization, or person involved in hostilities. This provision is contentious as it expands the armed conflict without requiring a direct link to the 9/11 attacks. The AUMF provision in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 is controversial as it expands the armed conflict without a direct link to the 9/11 attacks, leading to concerns about its broad language and potential implications. Some view Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 as expanding the armed conflict without a direct link to the 9/11 attacks, raising concerns about its broad language and implications. It grants the President discretion in determining parties for the use of force, with some noting the removal of limits on identifying parties in the conflict. Additionally, it identifies belligerent parties beyond Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, including nations, organizations, and persons engaged in or supporting hostilities. The requirement for these entities to engage in or support hostilities suggests a nexus to armed conflict rather than mere support. The requirement for entities described in Section 1034 to engage in or support hostilities suggests a nexus to armed conflict. The use of past tense in the description could imply belligerent status even if support occurred before 9/11 with no impact on the US. The purpose of identifying enemy parties is tied to the President's authority to detain. Entities described in Section 1034 could be considered belligerents even if their support for Al Qaeda or the Taliban occurred before 9/11 with no impact on the US. The legislative history suggests that Section 1034 is not meant to expand the conflict with Al Qaeda but to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 indicates that Section 1034 aims to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees, rather than authorizing a significant expansion of the conflict with Al Qaeda. The House Armed Services Committee report notes the evolving terrorist threat from Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, emphasizing the ongoing authority to address these threats under the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The terrorist threat has evolved despite pressure from the US and its allies, with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces still posing a grave threat to national security. The Authorization for Use of Military Force includes the authority to address this threat, as affirmed by the Executive Branch's interpretation in a 2009 filing. This interpretation aligns with Congress's granted authorities. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2009 aligns with Congress's granted authorities, affirming the President's existing authority. The term \"associated forces\" may not permit the expansion of force beyond what is already allowed under the AUMF, but the word \"associated\" is not limited to armed organizations fighting alongside the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Congress's codification of the language without further definition could potentially supersede the AUMF as interpreted by courts. The term \"associated forces\" in the Authorization for Use of Military Force may not allow for the expansion of force beyond current permissions. Congress's codification of the language without further definition could potentially supersede the AUMF as interpreted by courts. The language used in Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo permits the detention of individuals associated with Taliban or Al Qaeda forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, arguing that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a. The White House objects to section 1034, stating it could change the conflict's scope and cause confusion. Section 1036 mandates the Secretary of Defense to set up a review process for Guantanamo detainees to assess the need for continued military detention for national security. This process is similar to one established by Executive Order 13567 but with differences like military officers on the initial review panel and stricter criteria. Section 1036 mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees, involving military officers on the initial review panel and stricter criteria for assessing the need for continued detention. The process includes full reviews every three years and more limited reviews annually, with limitations on private counsel assistance. A report to Congress is required within 180 days regarding the establishment of this review process. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees, including full reviews every three years and more limited reviews annually. A report to Congress is mandated within 180 days regarding this process, which involves military officers on the review panel and restrictions on private counsel assistance. The review process does not apply to detainees undergoing trial or serving a sentence by military commission, or those ordered released by a federal court. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting full reviews every three years, with the detainee entitled to assistance from a military representative. The detainee can present statements, evidence, and call witnesses to advocate on their behalf. They are provided with information the panel will consider before the hearing. The detainee is entitled to assistance from a military representative during the review process, which involves a panel of military officers conducting full reviews every three years. The detainee can present statements, evidence, and call witnesses to advocate on their behalf. They are provided with information the panel will consider before the hearing, including mitigating information. Outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel if authorized, may provide a written submission to the military panel. The detainee is entitled to assistance from a military representative during the review process, which involves a panel of military officers conducting full reviews every three years. Outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel if authorized, may provide a written submission to the military panel for consideration. The military panel assesses the detainee's continued internment based on various factors, including the likelihood of terrorist activity if transferred or released. In assessing a Guantanamo detainee's continued internment, a military panel considers factors like the likelihood of terrorist activity upon release, reestablishing ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, mitigating information, and intelligence value. An interagency review board is also required. The government's submission to the panel aims to mitigate threats posed by individuals and assess the intelligence value for national security. An interagency review board, consisting of senior officials from various departments, reviews the military panel's recommendations for errors and can reject them by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board identifies a suitable country for transfer. The interagency review panel is responsible for reviewing the military panel's recommendations for errors and can reject them by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the panel identifies a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review panel reviews military panel recommendations for errors and can reject them. The detainee does not have the right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House identified Section 1036 as a provision that could lead to a presidential veto due to the periodic review process undermining the system. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, stating that it could lead to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process for detainees. It argued that the section undermines the President's Executive Order by limiting advice from intelligence and law enforcement professionals, interfering with DOD's detention operations, and restricting the transfer of non-citizen detainees into the United States. The provision in Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, particularly those at Guantanamo, into the United States. This restriction hinders the Executive branch's ability to make informed decisions regarding national security interests and interferes with DOD's detention operations. Congress enacted funding measures to restrict executive discretion in transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the detention facility. Funding measures enacted by Congress restrict the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees into the United States, including for criminal prosecution, in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the detention facility. Recent limitations prohibit any transfer of detainees into the country, motivated by plans to transfer specific individuals like Khalid Sheik Mohammed. The 2012 Minibus and Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 funding restrictions prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for criminal prosecution, making military commissions the primary forum for trials until the end of FY2012. The funding restrictions in Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for prosecution until the end of FY2012. Unlike the 2012 Minibus restrictions, Section 1039 also limits the transfer or release of detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo. The restrictions in H.R. 1540 prevent transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for prosecution until the end of FY2012. However, detainees held at foreign locations other than Guantanamo may still be brought into the country by other government agencies. The White House strongly objects to these restrictions. The White House strongly objects to certain provisions in H.R. 1540, including a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents for terrorist offenses in US courts. The Obama Administration argues that these measures interfere with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees and pose a threat to national security. The White House opposes provisions in H.R. 1540 that limit executive branch authority in prosecuting detainees and pose a threat to national security. Section 1039 challenges the Executive branch's ability to determine prosecution of detainees, while Section 1037 restricts funds for constructing facilities to house Guantanamo detainees in the US. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the use of funds for constructing facilities in the US to house Guantanamo detainees in FY2012. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring detainees to foreign countries unless certain criteria are met, with exceptions for court-ordered releases. These restrictions mirror those in the 2012 Minibus bill. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries unless certain criteria are met, with exceptions for court-ordered releases. The restrictions are motivated by congressional concern over possible recidivism by released detainees. The 2011 NDAA and CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, with concerns over recidivism. No detainee has been released since these restrictions took effect, and the impact on subsequent transfers is unclear. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the destination is not a state sponsor of terrorism for a transfer to occur. Since the 2011 NDAA and CAA, detainee transfers have been restricted. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the destination is not a state sponsor of terrorism for a transfer to occur. The detainee must agree to prevent future threats to the US, share relevant information, and allow US agencies access. These requirements are similar to those for Guantanamo detainee detention. The certification requirements for detainee transfers under Section 1040 are similar to those established in the 2011 NDAA and CAA, with an additional condition that the receiving foreign entity must allow US authorities access to the transferred individual. The White House has criticized these restrictions on detainee transfers. The White House disapproves of restrictions on detainee transfers, claiming they interfere with foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 requires a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees within 90 days of enactment. The Secretary of Defense must submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees within 90 days of enactment, detailing limitations and privileges for detainee communications and access to legal representation. The protocol must include monitoring procedures for legal materials while preserving the detainee's privilege for military commission trials or habeas. The provision requires a description of monitoring procedures for legal materials or communications for the protection of national security while preserving the detainee's privilege for military commission trials or habeas proceedings. Additionally, DOD funds in FY2012 cannot be used to allow family members of Guantanamo detainees to visit them. Guantanamo detainees repatriated to certain countries will not receive the rights and benefits outlined in the Compact of Free Association. The Compact of Free Association does not provide rights and benefits to Guantanamo detainees repatriated to certain countries like Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands. This provision does not apply to former detainees resettled in these countries, but it does affect citizens of these countries who were detained at Guantanamo and returned home. Section 1043 of the Compact of Free Association applies to citizens of Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands who were detained at Guantanamo and returned to their country of origin. Section 1042 requires consultation before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. The consultation involves deciding whether the prosecution should occur in a U.S. district court or before a military commission, and whether the individual should be transferred to military custody. Section 1042 of the defense authorization bill requires consultation with the Secretary of Defense before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. The consultation involves deciding the venue for prosecution and potential transfer to military custody. The White House opposes this provision, citing existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1042 of the defense authorization bill requires consultation with the Secretary of Defense before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. The White House opposes this provision, citing existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried only by military commission, potentially causing delays in taking individuals into custody. The provision in the defense authorization bill applies to terrorist attacks against persons or property in the US or US Government property/personnel outside the US, for trial by a military commission. It lacks clear definitions for terms like \"terrorist attack\" and its applicability to failed attacks. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian suspect in the Christmas Day 2009 airliner bombing attempt, may provide insight into its potential application. The criteria for what constitutes a \"terrorist attack\" under the defense authorization bill are unclear, especially regarding failed attacks. Using the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as an example, it may be necessary to prove that the attack occurred within the United States or involved U.S. government property or personnel. Additionally, the offense must be one that can be tried by a military commission and the accused must be subject to its jurisdiction. The criteria for defining a \"terrorist attack\" under the defense authorization bill are unclear, especially for failed attacks. It may be necessary to demonstrate that U.S. government property or personnel were involved in the attack. The offense must be one that can be tried by a military commission, and the accused must be subject to its jurisdiction. The attempted use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft could fall under the jurisdiction of military commissions, but it must also be shown that the offense was committed in the context of hostilities. To establish jurisdiction under Section 1042, a connection between the accused and opposing forces in an armed conflict must be shown. The accused must be a non-U.S. citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This excludes those qualifying for POW status but includes individuals who engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or its partners, supported hostilities, or were part of such actions. The bill defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as someone who engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, supported hostilities, or was part of al Qaeda. It does not specify how these criteria will be determined, leaving it up to military commissions or Article III courts. The impact on cases involving material support is unclear. The bill defines an unprivileged enemy belligerent as someone who engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, supported hostilities, or was part of al Qaeda. Military commissions or Article III courts would determine the criteria. The provision could complicate extraditions and trials of terrorism suspects. It may only apply to foreign nationals in US custody and not those arrested in sting operations. The provision in the bill regarding unprivileged enemy belligerents may complicate extraditions and trials of terrorism suspects in US custody. It may not apply to those arrested in sting operations and does not outright preclude trials in Article III courts or military commissions for the individuals it describes. The bill regarding unprivileged enemy belligerents may complicate extraditions and trials of terrorism suspects in US custody. It does not outright preclude trials in Article III courts for the individuals it describes, nor does it require a military commission trial. The provision allows for broader discretion among executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions, potentially avoiding military commission jurisdiction by framing offenses under terrorism-related provisions of title 18, U.S. Code. The provision in the bill allows for broader discretion among executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions, potentially avoiding military commission jurisdiction by framing offenses under terrorism-related provisions of title 18, U.S. Code. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the Article III court's jurisdiction. Executive branch officials have criticized this provision for constraining executive discretion in choosing the appropriate forum for prosecuting detainees. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information on terrorism for two years, allowing rewards up to $5 million. It also changes the reporting requirement to February. Section 1041 mandates quarterly briefings by the Secretary of Defense to congressional defense committees. Section 1041 extends the authority for global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations and requires quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees. Section 1044 expresses Congress's support for DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to terrorist groups. Section 1045 requires the President to issue planning guidance for denying safe havens to terrorist groups and strengthening \"at-risk states.\" It mandates the submission of guidance documents to Congress and the establishment of memorandums of understanding between agencies. Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in Title X. The President must submit guidance documents to Congress within 15 days of completion. Agencies carrying out the guidance must enter into a memorandum of understanding. Senate bill S. 1867 addresses \"Detainee Matters\" in Title X, passed on December 1, 2011, with revisions to address Administration concerns. A clarification was made regarding the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 on December 1, 2011, with amendments clarifying the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. Section 1031 affirms the AUMF includes authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as unprivileged enemy belligerents. The bill defines \"covered persons\" in Section 1031(b). The Senate passed H.R. 1540 on December 1, 2011, affirming the AUMF includes authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as unprivileged enemy belligerents. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 affirming the AUMF includes authority to detain \"covered persons\" involved in 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as those who supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners. The White House objected to language limiting detentions to those captured in the course of hostilities. The Senate passed a bill affirming the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces. The White House objected to language limiting detentions to those captured in the course of hostilities. Section 1031 of the bill states that dispositions under the law of war may include detention without trial until the end of hostilities authorized by the AUMF, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. The provision allows for the addition of other options. The Senate passed a bill affirming the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces. Section 1031 of the bill allows for detention without trial until the end of hostilities authorized by the AUMF, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. The provision includes the language \"may include\" suggesting the possibility of adding other options. The bill does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 revises the detention authority under the AUMF, potentially allowing for the detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens within the United States, while reinforcing the executive branch's view of its detention authority. The committee-modified version of the AUMF aims to reinforce the executive branch's detention authority, with significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens. An amendment rejecting long-term military detention for U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status was considered but ultimately not adopted. An amendment was added to Section 1031 to clarify that it does not affect existing laws on the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Supreme Court has recognized the authority to detain individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The Supreme Court has recognized the authority to detain individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but the circumstances for detaining persons captured in other locations have not been definitively adjudicated. Section 1031 does not clarify the circumstances for holding a U.S. citizen, resident alien, or person captured within the United States as an enemy belligerent in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The revised provision in S. 1867 does not attempt to clarify the circumstances in which a U.S. citizen, resident alien, or person captured within the United States may be held as an enemy belligerent in the conflict with Al Qaeda. It does not provide additional clarification for terms such as \"substantial support,\" \"associated forces,\" or \"hostilities,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of the conflict scope. The Secretary of Defense is required to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"organizations, entities, and individuals considered to be 'covered persons'.\" The revised provision in S. 1867 does not clarify the circumstances for holding individuals as enemy belligerents in the conflict with Al Qaeda. It requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on the application of the provision to \"covered persons,\" potentially broadening the scope of the conflict. The Administration has not objected to the language but cautions against opening new legal questions that could distract from national security efforts. The Administration has not objected to the revised Section 1031 language but warns against unnecessary codification of existing authorities. Congress must avoid opening new legal questions that could distract from national security efforts. Section 1032, requiring military custody for certain Al Qaeda members, has sparked controversy. Section 1032 of the legislation requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities authorized by the AUMF. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens captured during authorized hostilities. Covered persons must be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war, with additional requirements to be met. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens captured during authorized hostilities. Covered persons must be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war, with additional requirements to be met. Persons meeting specific criteria are required to be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war, with options including military detention, trial before a military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign government or entity. The legislation mandates temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens captured during authorized hostilities. Covered persons must be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war, with options including military detention, trial before a military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign government or entity. Section 1032 of S. 1867 specifies that covered forces are ones that \"act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda,\" indicating that the Taliban may not be treated as a force associated with Al Qaeda unless its actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. The omission of any express reference to the Taliban in Section 1032 of the legislation suggests that it may not be considered a force associated with Al Qaeda unless its actions are coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. Questions may arise regarding the detention of members of an associated force that acts independently but coordinates some activities with Al Qaeda. Determinations could be based on the specific attack the individual is involved in. This could potentially allow captured Taliban insurgents, not suspected of Al Qaeda cooperation, to be turned over to the Afghan government without undergoing the certification process in Section 1033. The legislation does not explicitly mention the Taliban in Section 1032, implying it may not be considered associated with Al Qaeda unless coordinated by them. This raises questions about detaining members of an associated force that acts independently but coordinates with Al Qaeda. The definition of an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is unclear, potentially allowing for military detention of individuals involved in attacks in a theater of operations. The legislation does not explicitly mention the Taliban in Section 1032, implying it may not be considered associated with Al Qaeda unless coordinated by them. Questions arise about detaining members of an associated force acting independently but coordinating with Al Qaeda. The definition of an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is ambiguous, potentially allowing for military detention of individuals involved in attacks in a theater of operations. The term \"attack\" could also be interpreted more broadly to cover terrorist acts against civilian targets, raising uncertainty about the application of the law of war in such circumstances. The legislation raises questions about the application of the law of war to attacks against civilian targets. It includes a new requirement for the President to report on procedures for implementing the provision within 60 days of enactment. S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to report on procedures for implementing the provision within 60 days of enactment, specifically regarding the designation of covered persons and the process for making such determinations. The new requirement in S. 1867 mandates the President to report on procedures for implementing the provision within 60 days of enactment, focusing on the designation of covered persons and the determination process. The procedures outlined include measures to prevent interruption of surveillance or intelligence gathering, delay determination process until after interrogation, and waiver authority for transferring individuals from third countries. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those required under Section 1036 for status determinations of persons detained under the AUMF. The bill mandates the President to report on procedures for implementing the provision within 60 days, focusing on the designation of covered persons and the determination process. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those required under Section 1036 for status determinations of persons detained under the AUMF. The bill requires the President to report on procedures for determining if a person qualifies for mandatory military detention under Section 1032. The process for making these determinations may involve constitutional due process requirements and could be challenged through habeas corpus. Section 1032 does not prohibit Article III trials. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, as it could complicate trials and limit counterterrorism tools according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. The provision does not prevent Article III trials but may implicate constitutional due process requirements. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and the White House oppose Section 1032, as it may limit counterterrorism tools and complicate trials. Panetta believes the provision could restrain the executive branch's use of counterterrorism tools and objects to its failure to clearly limit its scope. The White House calls Section 1032 unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial. The White House strongly opposes Section 1032, calling it an unnecessary restriction on the President's authority to defend against terrorist threats. They doubt that revisions to the provision will fix its fundamental problems. The committee revisions to Section 1032 are seen as inadequate by the White House, as they do not address the fundamental problems with the provision. Requiring the President to develop procedures to prevent issues with military custody could lead to confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 maintains restrictions on the use of military funds for transfers or releases. The President's task to create procedures acknowledges the risks of military custody without a clear solution, potentially causing confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 extends restrictions on using military funds for Guantanamo detainee transfers to foreign countries unless specific criteria are met. Section 1033 extends restrictions on using military funds for Guantanamo detainee transfers to foreign countries unless specific criteria are met, including certification by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The Senate bill extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries unless specific criteria are met, including certification by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The certification requirements include measures to prevent the individual from engaging in terrorism and sharing relevant information with the United States. The Senate bill imposes certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries to prevent terrorism. The bill does not require access agreements with the receiving foreign entity, except in specific cases. Transfers are prohibited to countries with previously transferred detainees engaging in terrorist activities. The Senate bill imposes certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries to prevent terrorism. Transfers are prohibited to countries with previously transferred detainees engaging in terrorist activities, unless waived by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense may waive provisions on transferring Guantanamo detainees if alternative actions will address risks of recidivism. The waiver must be in the national security interests of the United States and submitted to congressional defense committees 30 days prior to the transfer. The Secretary of Defense can waive transfer provisions for Guantanamo detainees if alternative actions mitigate recidivism risks. The waiver must serve national security interests and be submitted to congressional defense committees 30 days before the transfer. The transfer restrictions in the Senate bill apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers, detainees under court orders or military commission agreements. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions under Section 1033 apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers, detainees under court orders or military commission agreements. It remains to be seen if the provisions would cover foreign refugees brought to the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo. The White House and Department of Defense have expressed disapproval of the transfer restriction provisions in the House-passed version of the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 of the 2012 NDAA imposes a prohibition on using DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US or its territories for housing Guantanamo detainees without congressional authorization. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of these transfer restrictions. The 2012 NDAA prohibits using DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US for housing Guantanamo detainees without congressional authorization. The Senate bill does not include a provision prohibiting the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not have restrictions on transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees into the United States, allowing for transfers to civilian law enforcement for prosecution. The only limitation is on transferring detainees for continued military detention if new facilities are needed. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not restrict transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States, except for continued military detention if new facilities are required. Section 1035 clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. Section 1035 of the 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. It requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days, outlining review panel procedures. The purpose of the periodic review is to determine if a detainee poses a continuing threat to U.S. security, not to review the legality of detention. The Secretary of Defense has the final decision on releasing or transferring a detainee, considering factors like the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity. The Secretary of Defense, after reviewing recommendations from a panel, has the final decision on releasing or transferring a detainee at Guantanamo. Factors considered include the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity, family or government support, potential trial by military commission, and law enforcement interest. The Administration objects to this provision as it shifts responsibility from a collaborative interagency process to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days outlining procedures for determining detainee status. The Administration objects to Section 1036, which shifts detainee status determination responsibility to the Defense Department. It requires a report within 90 days outlining procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF. The provision also specifies elements for procedures regarding unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. The provision in question addresses the procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. It mandates that a military judge preside over the proceedings and allows the belligerent to be represented by military counsel. These requirements apply regardless of the detainee's location and may provide greater privileges to detainees held by the United States in Afghanistan during status determination hearings. The provision mandates a military judge to preside over status determination hearings for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention, regardless of location. It may offer greater privileges to detainees held in Afghanistan by the United States. The impact on Guantanamo detainees and habeas challenges remains unclear. The provision requires a military judge to oversee status determination hearings for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention, regardless of location. It is uncertain how this would impact Guantanamo detainees and their habeas challenges. The implications of Section 1036 on detainees may vary depending on its interpretation and application to all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF. The provision in Section 1036 requires a military judge to oversee status determination hearings for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention, regardless of location. It is unclear how this would affect Guantanamo detainees and their habeas challenges. The provision does not clarify how to determine if a detainee is designated for long-term detention before a status hearing, raising questions about the process. The bill allows for the long-term detention of captured unprivileged enemy belligerents, with disposition decisions made prior to status determinations. Those designated for trial or transfer would not have military counsel or judges at their status hearings. Multiple status determinations may be held to change the detainee's disposition. The bill allows for long-term detention of captured unprivileged enemy belligerents, with disposition decisions made before status determinations. There is a possibility of multiple status determinations to change detainee disposition, which may not involve military counsel or judges. The White House has expressed disapproval of this process. The bill allows for long-term detention of captured unprivileged enemy belligerents, with disposition decisions made before status determinations. Detainees not designated for long-term detention may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. The White House disapproves of this provision, citing conflicts with established detainee review procedures. Section 1037 of the bill permits plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a House-passed provision but without amending existing code references."
