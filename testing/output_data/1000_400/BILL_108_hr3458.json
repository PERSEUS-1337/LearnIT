The Congress finds that type 2 diabetes affects millions of Americans, leading to diabetic retinopathy which can cause blindness. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes, and early detection is crucial. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90 percent. Remote assessment has the potential to reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas lacking access to in-office eye examinations. Medicare coverage is expanded to include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, aiming to reach patients in rural or underserved areas without access to in-office eye exams. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals diagnosed with diabetes. The examination must meet technical standards set by the Secretary and be conducted via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy to be provided to eligible patients by qualified healthcare professionals using store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health care information. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy to be furnished through store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health care information. Interim payment will be provided until a final regulation is published, and a study on reimbursement for remote assessments will be conducted. The Secretary will provide payment for retinopathy assessments under a new HCPCS code. A study on costs for remote diabetic retinopathy assessments will be conducted, including per-patient and administrative costs. Recommendations will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The Secretary will conduct a study on diabetic retinopathy services, analyzing per-patient and administrative costs.

An evaluation will be conducted to determine the program's effectiveness in increasing early detection of diabetic retinopathy. The advisory committee will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program to determine its effectiveness in increasing early detection of diabetic retinopathy and if it can serve as a model for similar screening programs for other chronic conditions. The advisory committee will assess the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy early and its potential as a model for other chronic condition screening programs. A report will be submitted to Congress within 42 months of the first grant, detailing the evaluation results. Definitions include the advisory committee and eligible entities like hospitals.
