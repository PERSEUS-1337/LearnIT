    "content": "The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $9,839,262,000 for fiscal year 2007, with $50,000,000 allocated for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes funding for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) to enhance access to laboratory science. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants for high-need local educational agencies to establish partnerships for access to laboratory science, improving laboratories and instrumentation for math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants are awarded competitively based on merit-reviewed criteria. Grants under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 are awarded competitively to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and other organizations. The Federal share of grant activities cannot exceed 33 percent. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 awards grants competitively to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships with various organizations. The Federal share of grant activities is limited to 33 percent, and approved grants are eligible for a 3-year period. High-need local educational agencies must submit a plan to be considered for a grant under this section. High-need local educational agencies must submit a plan developed with input from various experts to be eligible for a grant under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002. The plan should align with State academic standards and be part of a comprehensive program to improve laboratory quality. The proposed laboratory improvements and instrumentation align with State academic standards and are part of a comprehensive program to enhance mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction. The laboratory experiences are designed to produce clear learning outcomes, complement classroom science instruction, integrate science learning with content, and incorporate ongoing student engagement. The curr_chunk describes the requirements for laboratory facilities, including alignment with academic standards, clear learning outcomes, integration with classroom instruction, professional development for teachers, safety assurances, and maintenance of equipment after the grant period. The curr_chunk outlines safety requirements, maintenance of equipment post-grant, and assessment methods to expand research literature on the impact of laboratory science on student understanding and achievement. Grants must supplement existing programs, not replace them, and fund activities that enhance learning. Grants awarded under this section must supplement existing programs and enhance secondary science education by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to improve student achievement. The program aims to improve mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level by enhancing laboratory facilities, providing equipment and materials, and offering professional development opportunities. The program aims to enhance secondary school instruction in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology through improving laboratory facilities, providing equipment and materials, offering professional development, and integrating hands-on laboratory experiences with classroom instruction. The program focuses on enhancing secondary school instruction in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology by providing training in laboratory safety for school personnel, implementing hands-on laboratory experiences to engage individuals in STEM fields, developing evaluation tools for funded activities, and other activities determined by the Director to achieve program goals. The program aims to enhance STEM education by providing training, hands-on experiences, and evaluation tools. Grants cannot be used for new facility construction. High-need educational agencies must submit an application for a grant. High-need local educational agencies must submit an application for a grant under this section, detailing the partnership, roles, plan, and activities aligned with State academic standards. The application for a grant must include a description of activities aligned with State academic standards, based on research and expected to improve student performance in mathematics and science. The grant application must include activities aligned with State academic standards, based on research, expected to improve student performance in mathematics and science. Additionally, it should describe activities to encourage interest in individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and prepare them for postsecondary studies. The grant application must include activities aligned with State academic standards to improve student performance in mathematics and science. It should also describe activities to encourage interest in underrepresented groups in STEM fields and prepare them for postsecondary studies. The Director will evaluate applications based on various criteria, including how changes in student achievement will be assessed, how success will be measured, and how programmatic assessments will be shared with the research community. The Director will review grant applications based on the partnership's ability to effectively carry out proposed programs, use relevant research and best practices to increase student achievement, align activities with State academic standards, and the likelihood of the partnership's success. The Director will review grant applications based on the partnership's ability to carry out programs effectively, align activities with State academic standards, demonstrate activities for larger reform efforts, and encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The Director will evaluate the program to identify best practices and materials developed by partnerships to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The Director will evaluate partnerships to identify best practices and materials in STEM education. Results will be disseminated to the public and relevant committees. The Director will disseminate evaluation results to the public and relevant committees. Materials developed under the program will also be widely available. Technical assistance will be provided upon request for high-need areas. The Director will make effective materials widely available to the public. Technical assistance will be provided to high-need local educational agencies for grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be convened by the Director in consultation with the Secretary of Education. The Director will convene an annual meeting of high-need local educational agencies that are grant recipients to promote national collaboration. Additionally, an annual report on program coordination will be provided to relevant congressional committees. The annual report will describe how the program is coordinated with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Definitions include 'high-need local educational agency' eligible for grants. The President's annual budget request must include required information. Definitions in this section include 'high-need local educational agency' eligible for grants and 'National Laboratory' as defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
