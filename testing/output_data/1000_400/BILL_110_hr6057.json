Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which support a variety of endangered species and are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures. The Arctic ecosystem supports eiders, walrus, seals, and fish, vital for Alaska Native cultures. Climate change is impacting sea ice habitat for polar bears, walrus, and seals, leading to the proposed listing of polar bears as a threatened species. The polar bear was proposed to be listed as a threatened species due to the projected loss of sea ice from global warming. The Department of the Interior missed the deadline to decide on providing protections under the Endangered Species Act, while also moving forward with oil and gas leasing in polar bear habitat. On February 6, 2008, the Department of the Interior approved oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area, a polar bear habitat spanning 29.4 million acres offshore Alaska. In April 2008, a court ruled that a decision on listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act must be made by May 15, 2008. Additionally, a report in September 2007 projected a significant decline in the polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century due to changes in sea ice conditions. The Department of the Interior approved oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area, a polar bear habitat. Reports projected a significant decline in the polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century due to changes in sea ice conditions. Future sea ice changes could lead to a loss of 2/3 of the world's polar bear population and extirpation of polar bears in Alaska. Global warming is the major threat, but potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses additional risks to polar bears and marine life. Potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses additional risks to polar bears and other marine life in the area. The Minerals Management Service's leasing plan includes offering millions of acres in these seas, overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. Recovering spilled oil in this harsh environment is challenging, especially during icy periods. The leasing plan includes offering 40 million acres in the Chukchi Sea and 33 million acres in the Beaufort Sea, both overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. The environmental impact statement for Lease Sale 193 in the Chukchi Sea highlights the significant risks of a large oil spill to the polar bear population and other marine mammals. The agency also notes a lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use. The agency highlights the risks of a large oil spill to polar bears and other marine mammals in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. Onshore industrial development activities can also harm important habitats and disturb wildlife. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the region due to threats to subsistence resources and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas due to risks of oil spills and harm to wildlife and habitats. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to prohibit leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources is identified. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to prohibit leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources, focusing on climate change impacts, is identified to determine potential impacts of oil and gas activities. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to prohibit leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources, focusing on climate change impacts, is identified to determine potential impacts of oil and gas activities. The determination of potential impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine and coastal environments, and Alaskan Native communities is required, along with reports on the adequacy of ongoing environmental studies. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to prohibit leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources, focusing on climate change impacts, is identified. A report to Congress must evaluate ongoing and completed studies, identify missing information, and make recommendations for additional research. The Secretary evaluates ongoing and completed studies, identifies missing information, and recommends additional research related to the listing of the polar bear as an endangered species or a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Secretary evaluates studies and recommends research related to listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act. Critical habitat is designated for the species, and oil spill response standards are set for arctic oil operations. The standard required for arctic oil operations mandates that 85 percent of spilled oil must be mechanically recovered and removed within 30 days, with a demonstration of achieving this before leasing or approving exploration and production plans. The arctic oil operations standard mandates 85 percent oil recovery within 30 days before approving any exploration or production plans. It also requires closing areas to oil and gas activity due to response gaps and implementing safety measures for oil spill prevention systems. The arctic oil operations standard mandates 85 percent oil recovery within 30 days before approving any exploration or production plans. It also requires closing areas to oil and gas activity due to response gaps and implementing safety measures for oil spill prevention systems in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. The arctic oil operations standard requires 85 percent oil recovery within 30 days, closing areas with response gaps, and implementing safety measures in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas to prevent oil spills. The term 'response gap' refers to a period where the recovery standard cannot be met. The term 'response gap' in the arctic oil operations standard refers to a period where the recovery standard cannot be achieved. 'Response gap analysis' involves calculating response operating limits for environmental factors and assessing local response capabilities and contingency plans. The response gap analysis in arctic oil operations standard involves assessing the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors that may prevent achieving oil spill recovery. This includes evaluating local response capabilities and contingency plans to account for the cumulative interplay between factors. The response gap analysis in arctic oil operations standard involves assessing limiting factors that may hinder achieving oil spill recovery, quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits. The response gap analysis in arctic oil operations standard involves quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits."
