    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports in the U.S. The relief is an additional import duty equal to the subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury to the domestic industry, and the International Trade Administration must confirm the subsidies. Before a 2007 investigation on CFS paper from China, CVD laws were not applied to NME countries like China. The International Trade Administration (ITA) must confirm subsidies for relief under countervailing duty laws in the U.S. In a 2007 investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, ITA found subsidies due to market principles in China, despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy (NME) country. This China-specific determination does not apply to other NME countries. The ITA confirmed subsidies for relief under countervailing duty laws in the U.S. by identifying subsidies in China, as many industries there operate based on market principles. China was previously considered an NME country, but the 2007 subsidy decision was specific to China and not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA designates countries as nonmarket economies based on various criteria such as currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, government control of production means. The ITA designates NME countries based on criteria like currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, and government control of production means. NME countries as of now include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The ITA first decided not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984. The ITA designated NME countries based on criteria like currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment regulations, and government control of production means. China, designated an NME country in 1983, is the United States' second largest trading partner and largest source of U.S. imports. The U.S. trade deficit with China and the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries have led to calls for increased use of U.S. trade measures. China, designated an NME country in 1983, is the United States' second largest trading partner, largest source of U.S. imports, and third largest export market. The U.S. trade deficit with China and alleged adverse impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries has led to calls for increased use of U.S. trade remedy laws against Chinese products, particularly concerning \"illegal\" subsidy programs. China is the chief target of U.S. antidumping action, with over 80 AD duty orders in place as of August 12, 2010. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for addressing China's subsidies. China faces over 80 AD duty orders due to antidumping actions by the U.S. Concerns include undervalued currency affecting trade deficit and U.S. production. The undervalued Chinese currency contributes to the U.S. trade deficit and harms U.S. production in various sectors. Allegations of Chinese currency manipulation have sparked congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. The undervalued Chinese currency has led to renewed congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. The applicability of NME classification with regard to China was determined in an ITA Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value. The ITA reaffirmed its determination regarding China as a nonmarket economy country, which affects countervailing actions. China's NME designation is limited to 15 years after its WTO accession, allowing for alternative methodologies in antidumping and countervailing actions until December 11, 2016. The United States and other WTO members can no longer use nonmarket economy or \"surrogate country\" methodology for price comparability in CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. The United States had two countervailing duty laws in force during the 1983-1984 investigations. These laws allowed for the imposition of countervailing duties on subsidized products from their country of origin. One law required a finding of injury to a U.S. domestic industry, while the other did not. The earlier law, repealed in 1995, only applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement\" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Subsidies and Countervailing Code. The Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in January 1995, was a modified version of a countervailing law initially enacted by the Tariff Act of 1897. It applied only to products from countries not \"under the Agreement\" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Subsidies and Countervailing Code. Section 303, repealed in 1995, allowed for the levying of a countervailing duty equal to the amount of subsidization without the need for injury. Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in 1995, allowed for the levying of a countervailing duty equal to the amount of subsidization without the need for injury determination. This legislation was part of broader provisions added by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 to implement international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (P.L. 96-39) added Subtitle A of Title VII to the Tariff Act of 1930, implementing international Subsidies and Countervailing Code provisions. This legislation required a determination of injury to U.S. industry from subsidized imports. The URAA repealed section 303 and removed subsidies from countervailing duty considerations. The URAA amended the countervailing duty law by incorporating provisions similar to section 303, which do not require injury determination in investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" This version is still in effect. Parallel countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated on December 13, 1983, based on petitions alleging public benefits received by manufacturers in both countries. The countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland alleged public benefits received by manufacturers in both countries, including bounties, grants, multiple exchange rate systems, and industry-specific trade conversion coefficients. Both cases proceeded in parallel with identical determinations on common issues, except for minor country-specific differences. The countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland focused on payments for losses incurred due to foreign sales below domestic prices. The determinations on common issues were identical, with minor country-specific differences. The ITA found both countries to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and considered them nonmarket economy countries. The question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to nonmarket economy countries had not been resolved. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the countervailing duty law under Section 303, regardless of their status. This issue was addressed in preliminary determinations for carbon steel wire rod cases involving Czechoslovakia and Poland. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from countervailing duty law under Section 303, as seen in preliminary determinations for carbon steel wire rod cases involving Czechoslovakia and Poland. The ITA is inclined to not exclude nonmarket economies from its application without further review in each case, marking its first opportunity to determine if practices by a government of a nonmarket economy country confer countervailable benefits. The ITA, in its analysis of government intervention in market and nonmarket economies, found that in nonmarket economies, central planners set prices without considering economic value, leading to prices not reflecting scarcity or abundance. In contrast to market economies where prices increase for scarce goods, in nonmarket economies, prices remain unchanged unless mandated by central planners. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy and if the conclusion would differ for a nonmarket economy. It preliminarily concluded that various programs did not constitute a bounty or grant in either type of economy. The ITA preliminarily determined that multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, and other programs did not provide bounties or grants in market or nonmarket economies. The agency continued investigations into alleged practices in Czechoslovakia and Poland to determine if they violated the CVD law. The ITA preliminarily determined that alleged practices in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not violate the CVD law. The final phase of the investigations focused on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. Congress never directly addressed whether the countervailing duty law applies to NME countries. The ITA noted that Congress never debated or legislated on whether the countervailing duty law applies to nonmarket economy countries, despite introducing provisions for State-controlled-economy countries in the Trade Act of 1974. The ITA highlighted that Congress recognized the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries in the Trade Act of 1974, specifically addressing injurious imports and market disruption, but not countervailing action. The Trade Act of 1974 recognized the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries, focusing on injurious imports and market disruption, but not countervailing action. In State-controlled-economy countries, traditional fair- or unfair-trade remedies were deemed ineffective due to the absence of supply and demand forces operating to produce prices. The legislative history of the CVD law restructuring in 1979 did not address the application of the law to NME countries, despite GATT permitting regulation of unfairly priced imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The Trade Act of 1974 recognized the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries, focusing on injurious imports and market disruption, but not countervailing action. The legislative history of the CVD law restructuring in 1979 did not address the application of the law to NME countries, despite GATT permitting regulation of unfairly priced imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The ITA consulted with various sources concluding that identifying and quantifying subsidies in NMEs is challenging due to the absence of market reference points. The countervailing duty law requires measuring a resource transfer from the state to the producer, which is difficult in nonmarket economies. The countervailing duty law is not applicable in nonmarket economies as there is no market reference point for measuring subsidies. The ITA concluded that NMEs like Czechoslovakia and Poland do not reflect the value of merchandise due to nonmarket cost or pricing structures. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland, as nonmarket economies, do not reflect the value of merchandise and therefore cannot receive bounties or grants. Final negative countervailing duty determinations were issued for manufacturers in these countries. Additionally, petitions were filed for subsidization of potassium chloride from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, leading to investigations initiated in April 1984. The ITA rescinded investigations on potassium chloride imports from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union due to the determination in the carbon steel wire rod cases. No countervailing investigations have been initiated from NME countries since then, except for one specialized exception in 1991. The ITA rescinded investigations on potassium chloride imports from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. Since then, no countervailing investigations have been initiated from NME countries, except for one specialized exception in 1991 regarding Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China. The petition in the Chinese fan CVD case claimed that the Chinese fan industry was a market-oriented industry with self-provided data, allowing for a countervailing investigation. The ITA concluded in its preliminary investigation that some input prices were not fair market value. The ITA concluded in its final investigation that the Chinese fan industry is not a market-oriented industry, as significant input prices are not market-determined. Therefore, the CVD law cannot be applied, resulting in a final negative determination in the case. The ITA's final investigation found that the Chinese fan industry is not market-oriented due to non-market-determined input prices. This led to a final negative determination in the case. Subsequently, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, reversing previous decisions in carbon steel wire rod cases. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled on July 30, 1985, that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, reversing previous decisions in carbon steel wire rod cases and ordering investigations to be resumed in potash cases. The court addressed grounds for nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries, including the argument that subsidies cannot be conferred in a nonmarket economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, despite arguments that subsidies cannot be conferred in such economies. The court emphasized that the plain language of the law must be regarded as conclusive, without allowing for per se exemptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, rejecting the idea that subsidies cannot exist in such economies. The court emphasized that the plain language of the law must be conclusive and does not allow for per se exemptions, criticizing the ITA for attempting to exempt nonmarket economies from the law. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, rejecting the idea that subsidies cannot exist in such economies. The court criticized the ITA for attempting to exempt nonmarket economies from the law, emphasizing that the agency has the authority to investigate deviations from patterns regardless of the form of the economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, rejecting the idea that subsidies cannot exist in such economies. The court criticized the ITA for attempting to exempt nonmarket economies from the law, emphasizing the agency's authority to investigate deviations from patterns regardless of the form of the economy. The court also highlighted that the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows countries to choose between subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, rejecting the idea that subsidies cannot exist in such economies. The court criticized the ITA for attempting to exempt nonmarket economies from the law, emphasizing the agency's authority to investigate deviations from patterns regardless of the form of the economy. Additionally, the court highlighted that Article 15 of the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows countries to choose between subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for attempting to exempt nonmarket economies from countervailing duty law, emphasizing the agency's authority to investigate deviations from patterns regardless of the form of the economy. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws and found that the CVD statute had remained unchanged since 1897. Congress had not defined terms like \"bounty\" and \"grant,\" leading to uncertainty on whether the statute applies to nonmarket economies. The court had to determine this issue as it was not addressed in the original enactment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the CVD statute, finding that Congress had not excluded nonmarket economies. The court determined that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the law. The appellate court concluded that economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports to the US were not considered bounties or grants under the CVD law. The court upheld the ITA's discretion in determining this, vacating the CIT order in two wire rod cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the CIT order regarding CVD determinations in wire rod cases and remanded them due to lack of jurisdiction. It also reversed the CIT order on potash cases. This decision led to a swift reaction in Congress, resulting in the introduction of H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress for countervailing duty law application. The U.S. Court of Appeals decision in the wire rod and potash cases prompted Congress to introduce H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress, which aimed to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. The House version included detailed procedural provisions, but the Senate version did not include a similar provision, leading to the House language being dropped in conference. In the 100th Congress, H.R. 3 aimed to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. The House version included procedural provisions, but the Senate version did not, leading to the House language being dropped in conference. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were introduced but not further considered. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries was addressed. Legislation expanded the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" to NME countries and prescribed the determination of its amount using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical provisions were included in subsequent Congresses, applying the countervailing duty law to NME countries for investigations of subsidies provided on or after a certain date. In the 106th through 109th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty (CVD) law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided on or after specific dates. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty (CVD) law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided on specific dates. Several bills were introduced in the 110th Congress to address trade issues with China, including H.R. 3306 (\"Fair Trade with China Act of 2005\") and H.R. 1498 (\"Chinese Currency Act of 2005\"). These bills aimed to apply countervailing duty actions to nonmarket economy countries, specifically targeting alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China. Several bills were introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress to address trade issues with China, including H.R. 1498 (\"Chinese Currency Act of 2005\") which aimed to define foreign exchange-rate manipulation as a countervailable subsidy. In the 110th and 111th Congress, bills were introduced to address trade issues with China, including H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, H.R. 1229, S. 974, and S. 1919. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 sought to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without regard to ownership or subsidy source. The bills introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to address trade issues with China by applying countervailing duties to nonmarket economies, regardless of ownership or subsidy source. The bills also specified that the determination of subsidies should be made without considering ownership, subsidy source, or economic reforms in the nonmarket economy. Additionally, the bills would prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings. The bills introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to address trade issues with China by applying countervailing duties to nonmarket economies, regardless of ownership or subsidy source. They would prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies. When determining subsidies in China, authorities may adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China or use those outside of China if necessary. If China is designated as a nonmarket economy country, authorities are directed to presume special difficulties exist and use terms and conditions prevailing outside of China for subsidy calculations. The bills aim to amend current law regarding China's nonmarket economy (NME) status, allowing the use of terms and conditions outside of China for subsidy calculations. The Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged export subsidies in 2006. The Bush Administration took steps in 2006 to address China's alleged export subsidies by initiating CVD investigations and consultations in the WTO. The ITA announced CVD investigations on products from China, including CFS paper, in response to concerns from domestic manufacturers and Congress. The International Trade Commission (ITC) and International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted investigations on allegedly subsidized coated paper from China. Preliminary determinations of material injury and subsidy were made, with net countervailable subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination confirmed that countervailable subsidies were provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China. In the CVD investigation, net countervailable subsidy rates ranged from 10.9% to 20.35%. The ITA's final determination found subsidies for producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's status as an NME country, the ITA noted significant economic reforms in China but also highlighted the state's significant role in the economy. The PRC government maintains a significant role in the economy despite economic reforms. The ITA found that China's economy is different from Soviet-style economies, with market forces determining prices for over 90% of products. Wage negotiations, more accessible foreign currency, and limited private ownership contrast with government control over investment decisions, money allocation, and wage setting. The ITA found that China's economy is influenced by market forces, with wages negotiated and private ownership acknowledged by the government. Despite being classified as a non-market economy, the Chinese government has reduced state control in some areas while maintaining it in others. This allows the agency to assess whether Chinese producers have received specific benefits. The ITA found that China's economy is influenced by market forces, allowing the agency to assess benefits to Chinese producers. On December 7, 2007, the ITC announced a negative determination of injury in investigations on CFS paper, citing reasons such as modest production capacity increase in China and Indonesia, lack of product shifting potential, and absence of significant price effects from imports. Based on the findings of the ITA and ITC regarding CFS paper imports from China and Indonesia, it was determined that there was no material injury or threat of injury to the domestic CFSP industry. The investigation was terminated, and any duties deposited were refunded or canceled. The domestic CFSP industry was not threatened by imports from China and Indonesia, leading to the termination of the investigation and refunding of duties. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, resulting in countervailing duties on 13 products. A subsequent investigation in 2008 led to the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. The investigation in late July 2008 resulted in the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed a lawsuit to prevent the ITA from continuing the CVD investigation, but the Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. Commerce may apply countervailing duty law to NMEs. The Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case regarding the application of CVD law to NME countries. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on CFS paper duties. China has been active in using AD investigations since joining the WTO, initiating its first CVD case in 2009. China has been actively using anti-dumping investigations against products from the United States and other countries since joining the WTO. In 2009, China initiated its first countervailing duty (CVD) case. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over what they deemed as illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs in response. On March 9, 2007, USTR Susan Schwab announced that China had agreed to terminate one of the nine challenged subsidy programs\u2014a regulation implemented by China's central bank that allowed large exporters to take advantage of discounted loans not available to other companies. The United States pointed to several tax laws and other measures allegedly used by the Chinese government to provide tax refunds or exemptions to Chinese businesses purchasing domestically produced goods. These subsidies can distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs across various industries. China agreed to terminate subsidies that could distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs by purchasing domestically produced goods instead of foreign products. USTR Schwab announced the agreement on November 29, 2007, with China committing to end the subsidies by January 1, 2008, under WTO rules. China signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to eliminate these WTO-prohibited subsidies permanently. In the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, the USTR confirmed that China had eliminated the subsidies. China agreed to terminate subsidies that could distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers by January 1, 2008, under WTO rules. China signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to eliminate these WTO-prohibited subsidies permanently. In the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report, the USTR confirmed that China had eliminated the subsidies. Despite the ITA's identification of subsidies in China, some in Congress indicated they intended to move forward. In December 2009, China confirmed the elimination of export-contingent benefits following a settlement agreement. Despite the ITA's identification of subsidies in China, Congress expressed intentions to address unfair trade practices that disadvantage American workers, farmers, and businesses. Congress may need to consider various issues related to trade remedies applied to China, including the impact on China's nonmarket economy status and the identification of subsidies in other nonmarket economy countries. The ITA's decision on identifying subsidies in China does not affect its nonmarket economy status or NME designations of other countries. Congress may need to consider legislation to ensure CVD laws apply to other NME countries like Vietnam. Trade with other NME countries is not significant, and there are no outstanding trade disputes. The amount of trade with other NME countries is not significant, and there are no outstanding trade disputes. There are currently no specific factors or methodologies provided in trade remedy laws for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. Making CVD procedures available to U.S. industries has trade-offs, as AD duties tend to be higher than countervailing duties. The authority to calculate expenses for normal value in NME countries is important. AD duties are generally higher than countervailing duties, especially for imports from nonmarket economy countries. If China remains an NME and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise, some AD duties may need adjustment to avoid double counting. The GAO highlighted this issue in a June 2005 report. The GAO highlighted the uncertainty of applying protection to Chinese products due to potential double counting of subsidies on targeted merchandise. This could result in lower combined rates than expected, leading to unintended consequences of reduced protection. If ITA targets subsidies in China, it may result in an overall reduction in protection provided to U.S. industries. If ITA targets subsidies in China, it could lead to unintended consequences of reduced protection for U.S. industries. However, some industries that previously couldn't obtain relief through the AD statute may be able to do so through CVD procedures."
