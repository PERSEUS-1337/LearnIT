    "content": "Identifying analogies across domains is a key task for artificial intelligence. Recent advances in cross-domain image mapping focus on translating images, but visual fidelity often falls short. This paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The cross-domain mapping task involves domain alignment and learning the mapping function, which can be iteratively solved to achieve quality comparable to full supervision. Humans have the remarkable ability to make analogies between unseen domains without prior supervision, which is crucial for leveraging previous knowledge in new situations. This skill is important for Artificial Intelligence to identify analogies between multiple domains. Analogy identification differs from supervised problems as no explicit example analogies are given in advance for unseen domains. Identifying analogies between multiple domains is crucial for Artificial Intelligence. Recent success in AI has been in supervised problems with explicit correspondences between input and output. Analogy identification is different as no explicit example analogies are given in advance for unseen domains. Several approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping between domains, using sets of images from different domains without explicit correspondences. The methods learn a mapping function that maps an image from one domain to its likely appearance in the other domain, utilizing distributional constraints. The methods aim to learn a mapping function that translates images between different domains by ensuring indistinguishable distributions and maintaining image integrity through a cycle constraint. The task involves identifying analogies between domains without explicit examples, but the translated images may lack visual fidelity for exact matching. In this work, the problem of analogy identification is addressed by adding exemplar-based constraints to improve visual fidelity and performance. Current methods lack the ability to perform exact matching due to constraints on distributions and inversion properties. The proposed method shows effectiveness even when only some sample images have exact analogies. The method proposed in this work adds exemplar-based constraints to improve visual analogy identification, showing effectiveness even when only some sample images have exact analogies. By finding correspondences between sets without exact matches, the method yields better visual quality than mapping functions. Additionally, a two-step approach is introduced for training a domain mapping function, which outperforms previous unsupervised mapping approaches. The method proposed in this work improves visual analogy identification by adding exemplar-based constraints, yielding better visual quality than mapping functions. A two-step approach is introduced for training a domain mapping function, which is more accurate than previous unsupervised mapping approaches. Analogy identification in this paper is related to image matching methods, specifically unsupervised style-transfer and image-to-image mapping. Various approaches for image matching have been proposed, including supervised deep neural networks and generic visual feature matching for unsupervised scenarios. However, standard visual features are not effective for achieving good analogies between different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology has revolutionized image synthesis, allowing for the creation of realistic images. While standard visual features are not effective for analogies between different domains, GAN methods train a generator network to produce samples from a target distribution. Image to image translation work often utilizes GANs to generate realistic images by training a generator network to synthesize samples from a target distribution. The generative architecture used is based on BID12, focusing on creating images based on input images rather than random noise. Unsupervised mapping for image translation involves no supervision apart from sample images from the two domains, with recent advancements in this area. Supervised mapping in image translation involves training with matching pairs of input and output images, using methods like GANs. The discriminator receives pairs of images to strengthen the link between source and target images. The U-net architecture is employed for this purpose. In image translation, supervised mapping involves training with matching pairs of input and output images using methods like GANs. The discriminator receives pairs of images to strengthen the link between source and target images, employing the U-net architecture. The method for analogy identification involves two sets of images in domains A and B, denoted as x i and y j respectively. BID2 showed improved mapping results in supervised settings without using GANs. The method for analogy identification involves finding matching indexes between two sets of images in domains A and B. An iterative approach is used to map images from the source domain to the target domain and search for matches. Our iterative approach involves mapping images from one domain to another using a GAN-based distribution method. A mapping function is trained to make images from domain A appear as if they belong to domain B by aligning their distributions. This alignment is enforced by training a discriminator to distinguish between the distributions of the mapped images and the target images. The distribution-constraint in GAN-based image mapping involves training a discriminator to distinguish between the distributions of mapped images and target images. Additional constraints like circularity and distance invariance have been found to be effective in improving the mapping process. The cycle approach ensures that images translated between domains A and B can be successfully recovered, using L1 loss for optimization. Additional constraints such as circularity and distance invariance have been effectively added to improve image mapping in GANs. The cycle approach involves training one-sided GANs in both directions A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A, ensuring that translated images can be recovered. The two-sided cycle loss function provides mapping functions between domains A and B, but does not guarantee exact correspondences between images. In the previous section, a distributional approach was described for mapping images from domain A to domain B. This section introduces a method for exact matches between domains, aiming to find matching indices for each image pair. Once exact matching is achieved, a fully supervised mapping function can be trained to obtain high-quality mappings similar to supervised methods. The proposed match matrix between images from domains A and B is used to weigh training samples for accurate mapping. The text discusses the process of obtaining exact matches between images from different domains to train a fully supervised mapping function. It introduces a proposed match matrix to weigh training samples for accurate mapping. The optimization involves continuous training of the mapping function and binary programming for the match matrix, with a relaxed binary constraint to enforce sparsity. An entropy constraint is added to encourage sparse solutions. The optimization process involves continuous training of the mapping function and binary programming for the match matrix, with a relaxed binary constraint to enforce sparsity. An entropy constraint is added to encourage sparse solutions, and the final objective is optimized using SGD. The optimization process involves continuous training of the mapping function and binary programming for the match matrix, with a relaxed binary constraint to enforce sparsity. By increasing the significance of the entropy term, solutions can converge to the original correspondence problem. Iteratively updating parameters for N epochs achieves excellent results. Good initialization of parameters is essential for performance. AN-GAN is a cross domain matching method that combines exemplar and distribution based constraints. The AN-GAN loss function includes distributional, cycle, and exemplar loss constraints. The optimization problem aims to minimize the loss function for improved performance. The AN-GAN optimization problem includes distributional, cycle, and exemplar loss constraints. The optimization process involves adversarially training discriminators D A and D B, setting initial parameters, and optimizing the exemplar loss with specific iterations and learning rate adjustments. The optimization process for AN-GAN involves aligning distributions before aligning individual images. The exemplar-loss is optimized through specific iterations and learning rate adjustments, with shared \u03b2 parameters between mapping directions. Euclidean or L1 loss functions were found to be insufficient for supervision, leading to the use of Laplacian pyramid loss in experiments. In experiments, Euclidean or L1 loss functions were not perceptual enough for supervision. The Laplacian pyramid loss provided some improvement, but the best performance was achieved with a perceptual loss function. This involved extracting VGG features for each image and using L1 loss on pixels for color consistency. Our loss function extracts VGG features for images I1 and I2, using different layers depending on image resolution. L1 loss on pixels ensures color consistency. The perceptual loss function considers the number of pixels and features in each layer, making it unsupervised matching. Our method for unsupervised matching extracts features off-the-shelf and conducts experiments on public datasets. It is compared against other methods using L1 loss on raw pixels and VGG feature loss. The state of existing solutions to cross-domain matching includes methods like Unmapped-Pixel, Unmapped-VGG, CycleGAN-Pixel, CycleGAN-VGG, and AN-GAN with limited iterations. These methods use different approaches to find the nearest neighbor in the target domain. The authors' CycleGAN code is used to train Eqs. 5, 6 with VGG loss for nearest neighbor computation in the target set. AN-GAN is trained with \u03b1 iterations only or with both \u03b1 and T XY iterations. Evaluation is done on 4 public datasets: Facades, Maps, and Zappos50K dataset. Edge images are detected using HED. The Maps dataset, scraped from Google Maps, consists of aligned Maps and satellite images. The dataset was down-sampled to 2k images for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others for exact correspondence identification. In experiments comparing methods for exact correspondence identification on the Maps dataset, it was found that matching using pixels or deep features alone cannot solve the task due to differences between domains. Simple mapping with CycleGAN and pixel-loss matching improved performance in most cases. The results presented in Table 1 show that matching between domains using pixels or deep features alone is not effective. Simple mapping with CycleGAN and pixel-loss matching improved performance, but there is still room for improvement. Using perceptual features, such as VGG features, yielded better results than pixel matching. Using VGG features as perceptual features improved performance for image retrieval tasks. Due to computational constraints, subsampling of features was necessary. The method of matching linear combinations of mapped images showed significant improvements in performance. The exemplar loss alone could potentially recover plausible matches between domains and mapping functions, although the optimization problem remains challenging. The method presented significant improvements by using \u03b2 parameters for both sides of the match and auxiliary losses to aid optimization. The full-method AN-GAN achieved significantly better performance for all datasets and matching directions. The distribution and cycle auxiliary losses are crucial for successful analogy finding. The full-method AN-GAN optimizes the mapping function to match each source sample with the nearest target sample, resulting in significantly better performance for all datasets and matching directions. In experiments with a percentage of matches unavailable, the task is to identify correct matches for samples without matches in the other domain. The task involves identifying correct matches for samples without matches in the other domain. The evaluation metric is the percentage of images with exact matches. Results show that the method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, with comparable performance even when 10-25% of samples do not have matches. Our method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, with comparable performance even when 10-25% of samples do not have matches. AN-GAN achieved around 90% match rate with as much as 75% of samples not having matches in some datasets. The method was also tested on finding similar matches when exact analogies are not available. In this experiment, the method was evaluated on finding similar matches in scenarios where exact analogies are not available. The DiscoGAN architecture was used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario from BID9. The results showed that when DiscoGAN mapped correctly, matching worked well, but in some cases, the quality of mapping was lower leading to poor matches. The Shoes2Handbags dataset was analyzed using DiscoGAN for mapping, showing varying quality of matches. AN-GAN was found to produce better analogies and alignment accuracy was achieved using a two-step approach. For the Facades dataset, 97% alignment accuracy was obtained, and a fully self-supervised mapping function was trained using Pix2Pix. For the Facades dataset, 97% alignment accuracy was achieved. A fully self-supervised mapping function was trained using Pix2Pix, showing superior accuracy compared to unsupervised methods. The method effectively turns an unsupervised problem into a supervised one by finding correspondences between domains. Our method achieves high accuracy in supervised image mapping, outperforming unsupervised methods like CycleGAN. The self-supervised approach performs similarly to fully supervised methods and significantly better than CycleGAN on various datasets. Our method, using a Pix2Pix architecture with only L1 loss, outperforms CycleGAN and is competitive with full-supervision. Additionally, we evaluated our method on point cloud matching, showing improved performance in low dimensional settings. The experiments were conducted using the Bunny benchmark for point cloud matching, testing the success rate of alignment for various rotation angles. Both CycleGAN and the proposed method utilized a fully connected network with 2 hidden layers, BatchNorm, Leaky ReLU activations, and a linear affine matrix for the mapping function. A loss term was added to account for the restriction of the transformation to a rotation matrix. Our method and CycleGAN utilized a fully connected network with 2 hidden layers, BatchNorm, Leaky ReLU activations, and a linear affine matrix for the mapping function. A loss term was added to encourage orthonormality of the weights of the mapper. Results show our method outperforms the baseline at large angles in achieving alignment accuracy. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline results reported in BID17 at large angles, achieving an RMSE alignment accuracy of 0.05. The algorithm introduced for cross domain matching in an unsupervised way focuses on improving match performance with the exemplar constraint. The method is effective for low dimensional transformations and settings without exact matches. In this work, a new method for cross domain matching in an unsupervised way was introduced, focusing on improving match performance with the exemplar constraint. The method significantly outperformed baseline methods on public datasets for full and partial exact matching. It presents an alternative view of domain translation by aligning domains and training a fully supervised mapping function between them. Future work is needed to explore matching between different modalities such as images, speech, and text. New distribution matching algorithms would need to be developed for this challenging scenario.
