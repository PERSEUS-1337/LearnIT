    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire at the end of 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends, with a 0% tax rate for certain taxpayers. Without legislative action, capital gains tax rates would have increased to 20% and dividends would be taxed at ordinary rates. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but increasing rates for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance. Obama proposed to retain the 15% and 0% tax rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers in his budget outlines for FY2010 and FY2011. He suggested taxing dividends and capital gains at 20% for married couples with income over $250,000 and single taxpayers with income over $200,000. The final resolution in 2013 was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals at higher rates, with thresholds set at $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is strongly influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue in FY2019, while the Congressional Budget Office projected a revenue difference of $40 billion based on different effective tax rates. The CBO projected that the effective capital gains tax would increase to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion. Supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to eliminate the realization response for affected assets. Proposals to tax capital gains as accrued, using mark-to-market rules, aim to eliminate the realization response for certain assets. Look-back treatment may apply to assets that are harder to value, increasing taxes to achieve similar after-tax earnings. These changes have complexities and implications for revenue projections. Discussions on realization responses in revenue estimates were held in the late 1980s. The report discusses the impact of realization responses on revenue projections for increasing taxes on capital gains. It suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Economists and policymakers are concerned about reduced potential revenue from capital gains taxes due to taxpayers delaying realizations. The report highlights concerns about potential revenue losses from capital gains taxes due to taxpayers delaying realizations, which could lead to a decrease in revenue if realizations are postponed until death. Capital gains realizations responses are typically expressed as elasticities, with a negative impact expected when tax rates fall. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax rate changes determines the revenue impact. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss from tax changes. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase generates revenue; if it is greater than one, revenue is lost. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax rate changes determines the revenue impact. Different elasticities are relevant, including the permanent elasticity for long-term responses to tax rate changes. The three types of elasticities relevant to capital gains realizations and revenues are discussed in the economics literature: permanent, short-run, and transitory. The transitory effect may occur due to varying incomes of wealthy individuals and pre-announced tax changes. The transitory effect in capital gains realizations can occur when wealthy individuals time their realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates. This short-term response poses challenges in estimation and affects shorter-term responses to tax changes. The short-term response to changes in capital gains tax rates can be influenced by taxpayers' timing of realizations to benefit from lower tax rates. However, this response may be dampened if there has been a recent surge in realizations due to pre-announced tax changes. The short-term response to changes in capital gains tax rates can be influenced by taxpayers' timing of realizations to benefit from lower tax rates. A surge in realizations in 1986 due to pre-announced tax changes affected revenue estimations. An increase in taxes that is not pre-announced is unlikely to cause a similar contraction in realizations. The short-term response to changes in capital gains tax rates can be influenced by taxpayers' timing of realizations to benefit from lower tax rates. A surge in realizations in 1986 due to pre-announced tax changes affected revenue estimations. An increase in taxes that is not pre-announced is unlikely to cause a similar contraction in realizations. The transitory response to tax changes can lead to temporary fluctuations in realizations, with significant responses seen in 1986 and 2012 due to legislative changes. In 2012, a large increase in capital gains tax rates occurred, leading to transitory responses among higher-income taxpayers. Prior to 1987, when capital gains were subject to graduated rates, fluctuations in income and taxes caused temporary responses even without changes in the law. Elasticities of realizations responses are based on various functional forms, with the percentage change in gains divided by the percentage change in tax rates rising proportionally with the tax rate. The elasticity of capital gains realizations rises proportionally with the tax rate. Elasticities should be reported with reference to the assumed tax rate, such as the 22% rate. The elasticities discussed in the 1990 debate reflect this rate. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative, but in this report, they will be stated in absolute value. This formulation also determines the revenue-maximizing tax rate. The underlying equations can be found in Appendix A. The report discusses the revenue-maximizing tax rate for capital gains, with elasticities presented in absolute value. The current law includes tax rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%, along with a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. Estimates show an overall marginal tax rate of around 21.2% to 21.3% for long-term capital gains. The 3.8% net investment income tax applies to high-income taxpayers with incomes above $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for singles. The overall marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains is estimated to be around 21.2% to 21.3%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to increase the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to increase the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%, considering realizations elasticities and revenue cost as crucial factors. Data analysis included aggregate time series and micro-data to estimate the realizations response. In 1990, the Administration considered realizations elasticities and revenue cost when proposing to increase the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. Data analysis included aggregate time series and micro-data studies to estimate the realizations response, with estimates varying dramatically from 0.3 to almost 4. Estimates of the realizations response varied dramatically, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue gains or losses. Aggregate time series estimates were generally lower, ranging from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual taxpayer data estimates ranged from 0.55 to 3.8, highlighting serious issues with estimation methods. Estimates of the realizations response varied widely, ranging from 0.3 to 3.8 based on individual taxpayer data. The range of estimated responses raised concerns about the reliability of the estimation methods, with individual data preferred over aggregate time series for more accurate results. Researchers faced challenges in estimating the realizations response, preferring individual data over aggregation to avoid bias and information loss. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses was difficult due to fluctuating income and tax rates, making it hard to rely on simple cross-section results for permanent responses. Individuals may need to time realizations to coincide with periods of low tax rates and cash in assets when income is low. Panel data studies reported smaller elasticities, but still above one in some cases, using the average of current, previous, and future tax rates as a permanent rate. Several panel studies over several years examined individual tax rates, reporting smaller elasticities but still above one in some cases. The Treasury may have chosen a larger elasticity based on panel results, despite aggregate time series data suggesting otherwise. Panel studies attempted to address transitory effects, but may not fully correct for them due to prolonged periods of lower or higher income. The last panel study showed a large elasticity, indicating that attempts to address transitory effects may not fully correct for them. Panel studies only covered a few years, so estimates could still reflect some transitory response elements. Ultimately, proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, although they were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates of realizations elasticities, influenced by the sharp spike in realizations in 1986. In 1986, there was a significant increase in realizations of gains taxes, which raised concerns about the accuracy of econometric studies. This spike occurred in December, seven times higher than the previous year, coinciding with a tax increase for the following years. Subsequent academic studies from 1990 onwards further examined this phenomenon. The spike in realizations of gains taxes in 1986 raised concerns about the accuracy of econometric studies. Additional academic studies from 1990 onwards further examined this phenomenon, with estimates reported by CBO, JCT, and Treasury in Table 1. The studies are ranked by elasticity, with the coefficient in the second column determining the elasticity when multiplied by the tax rate. The studies in Table 1 rank capital gains realizations by elasticity, with coefficients determining the elasticity when multiplied by the tax rate. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to realizations response, noting that realizations cannot exceed accruals over time. The study found that the upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, indicating that realizations cannot exceed accruals over time. This limit is lower than estimates from other studies and suggests that individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs. The study found that the upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, indicating that realizations cannot exceed accruals over time. This limit is lower than estimates from other studies and suggests that individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs. The elasticity is likely to be lower in reality, as some assets are unlikely to be sold due to investor satisfaction. The study covered data from 1954 to 1989, estimating a 46% realization to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows similar ratios of 48% and a 17.3% tax rate, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities found. The study conducted in 1991 analyzed data from 1954 to 1989, estimating a 46% realization to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows similar ratios of 48% and a 17.3% tax rate, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial study. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study suggested that realizations could potentially increase 4.25 times their current value if all taxes and costs were eliminated, but the corrected elasticity was 3.2, reinforcing the observation that panel studies could not exceed certain limits. The Burman and Randolph study in 1991 found a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity when analyzing state tax rates. Panel studies could not address transitory issues like cross-section studies. The study suggested that realizations could increase 4.25 times if all taxes and costs were eliminated, but the corrected elasticity was 3.2, indicating limits to realizations elasticities. The Burman and Randolph study used state tax rates to estimate elasticities, finding a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the study with similar results. Subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, with Auten and Joulfaian having the highest elasticities. Adding state tax rates and longer panel studies likely lowered elasticities compared to earlier studies. The Auten and Joulfaian study, along with the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study, had the highest elasticities among individual panel studies. They added state tax rates and had longer panels, affecting their estimates. The Dowd study also conducted sensitivity analysis, resulting in a wide range of estimates. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study provided sensitivity analysis with a wide range of estimates based on different specifications, variables, and time periods. The studies used aggregate time series data, with some controlling for unusual years like 1986. The studies analyzed the transitory elasticity of the wrong sign using aggregate time series data. Gillingham and Greenlees added a few years of data, while Eichner and Sinai added many more years. More years in time series data led to lower elasticities, falling within the range of studies from the 1980s. One study was based on Australian data, and two state studies grouped data by state with time controls. The third time series study based on Australian data and two state studies using aggregate data over time grouped by state showed results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. Bakija and Gentry emphasized the importance of controlling for state fixed effects, with coefficients rising from 2.91 to 3.88 without state fixed effects. The elasticities in Table 1 are closer together and lower than those in studies from the 1980s. JCT's current coefficient appears similar to the estimate used during the 1990 debate. The coefficients rise from 2.91 to 3.88 without state fixed effects. The elasticities in Table 1 are lower than those in studies from the 1980s. Both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue to be gained from increasing the tax rate on capital gains. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for raising the tax rate by five. The JCT and Treasury estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains appear high and likely understate the revenue to be gained. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for a five-percentage-point increase in the tax rate, showing a reduction in revenue gain ranging from 26% to 97% of the static gain. The revenue gain from a five-percentage-point tax rate increase on capital gains ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year, a difference of $30.4 billion. Implementing measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method could increase capital gains revenues significantly. Implementing accrual-based taxation with a look-back method could significantly increase capital gains revenues, potentially collecting $222 billion on unrealized gains in a steady state. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable, but may overstate the permanent elasticity. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study in the 1980s produced the largest elasticity estimate, exceeding Gravelle's upper limit. Different subperiods show dramatically differing estimates, suggesting fragility in the results. Eichner and Sinai's time series results include more years than other studies, indicating a preference for their findings. Overall, the elasticity is likely below 0.5 based on various studies and calculations. The Eichner and Sinai results, along with the CBO study, suggest that the elasticity of increasing the tax rate is likely below 0.5. This indicates that revenue gains from a five percentage point tax rate increase may be underestimated. The findings also show that revenue gains could be three times higher than projected by the JCT, and up to 45% larger using the upper limit estimate. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated with a variety of functional forms, but one of the most common is a semi-log function. The revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates could be three times higher than projected by the JCT, and up to 45% larger using the upper limit estimate. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function. The formula for calculating taxes under the look-back method is shown. The relationship between gains and tax rate can be expressed as a semi-log function. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function. The revenue maximizing tax rate is where the derivative of revenue with respect to revenue equals zero, which is equal to 1/b if the coefficient of b is two. The revenue maximizing tax rate can be calculated using the formula (1-bt) = 0, which equals 1/b if the coefficient of b is two. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. The growth rate g can be determined using the formula g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. The revenue maximizing tax rate can be calculated using the formula (1-bt) = 0, which equals 1/b if the coefficient of b is two. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. The growth rate g can be determined using the formula g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. Studies in the 1980s reported elasticities influencing realizations response during the 1990 debate. In the 1980s, studies reported elasticities influencing realizations response during the 1990 debate. These studies faced challenges in relating capital gains realizations to tax rates, with debates over the type of data to be used. Statistical studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates face challenges, with debates over using aggregate time series or individual taxpayer data. Aggregate results range from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual data estimates vary from 0.55 to almost 4. Individual data is preferred due to the loss of information with aggregate data. Estimates based on micro data varied from 0.55 to almost 4, reflecting a mix of time series and cross-section results. It is more desirable to use individual data to avoid loss of information and bias in results. Changes in transactions costs and asset prices could cause estimates to be overstated. Problems with individual data sets were severe. Changes in transactions costs and a disconnect between asset prices and accruals may lead to overstated estimates. The reliability of aggregate time series results is favored due to severe problems with individual data sets. The effective capital gains tax rate poses a significant econometric problem as it is an endogenous variable influenced by realizations. Various techniques could be employed to address this issue. The endogeneity of the capital gains tax rate poses a serious econometric problem, especially in individual cross-section data. Various techniques, such as using first dollar tax rate or instrumental variables, can be used to address this issue. The distinction between permanent and transitory responses is also important when using individual data. The endogeneity of the capital gains tax rate is a significant issue in individual cross-section data. Variations in tax rates can lead individuals to time realizations to coincide with low rates or cash in assets during periods of low income. Attempts to address this issue with panel studies may not fully correct for the transitory effect. Studies since the 1980s have attempted to address the issue of endogeneity in capital gains tax rates. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies and found varying elasticities. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) conducted a study using a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies on capital gains tax rates. They found varying, but quite large, elasticities exceeding 1 and in some cases exceeding 5. Their results suggest potential issues with previous studies and highlight problems with short panels. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extends a previous time series analysis on capital gains tax rates from 1954-1985 to 1989. They made changes in the approach used by CBO and found large, but statistically insignificant results, suggesting potential transitory effects. These results were excluded from further analysis due to methodological concerns. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extends a previous time series analysis on capital gains tax rates from 1954-1985 to 1989. They made changes in the approach used by CBO, including using instrumental variables techniques and considering different instruments to increase the coefficient and elasticity values. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended the time series analysis on capital gains tax rates to 1989. They made changes in the approach by using instrumental variables techniques and different instruments to increase coefficient and elasticity values. The provision increased the coefficient from 2.9 to 4.2 and elasticity at a 22% tax rate from 0.64 to 0.92. Using the maximum tax rate as an instrument increased the coefficient to 5.8 and elasticity to 1.28. Differencing the data produced higher elasticities but were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989, excluding 1986, resulted in estimates of 3.4 and 3.5 when differencing the data. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended the analysis on capital gains tax rates to 1989, using different instruments to increase coefficient and elasticity values. They found that using the maximum tax rate as an instrument resulted in higher coefficient and elasticity values. However, the authors concluded that micro-data approaches are superior, and there are challenges in using the maximum rate as an instrument. The study by Burman and Randolph (1994) is considered innovative since the 1980s, focusing on the use of predicted gains rate or maximum rate as an instrument in time-series regression. They found challenges with using the maximum rate due to changes in tax laws over time, leading to varying impacts on taxpayers. The coefficient of 3.4 was reported in their study. The Burman and Randolph study from 1994 innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They found that the coefficient of 3.4 was reported in their study, highlighting the challenges of using the maximum rate as it varied in impact on taxpayers over time. The authors of the Burman and Randolph study from 1994 separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate. The transitory elasticity was estimated at 6.45. Subsequent studies also used state tax rates to analyze permanent responses. Bogart and Gentry (1995) relied on state differentials and aggregate state level gains from 1979 to 1990 in their analysis. Several subsequent studies, including Bogart and Gentry (1995) and Auerbach and Siegel (2000), used state tax rates to analyze permanent responses. Bogart and Gentry relied on state differentials and aggregate state level gains from 1979 to 1990, reporting an elasticity of 0.65. Auerbach and Siegel replicated results for a different time period, reporting an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean of the tax rate. The tax rate reflects a coefficient of 2.5, leading to an elasticity of 0.55 at a 22% rate. Auerbach and Siegel used panel data from 1985 to 1994, finding an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, estimated to be around 25%. They also reported a transitory elasticity of 4.9. Auerbach and Siegel's study found a permanent elasticity of 1.75, higher than the transitory elasticity of 4.9. They used panel data from 1985 to 1994 and included additional instruments in their analysis. The coefficient reported in Table 1 is 1.126. The addition of the current first dollar rate adds a transitory element to the permanent tax rate, explaining the larger elasticity coefficient of 1.126 reported by Auerbach and Siegel. They also found no response for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers. Eichner and Sinai's study extended time series analysis through 1997, excluding 1986 and possibly 1997, resulting in a coefficient of 2.18 and an elasticity of 0.5 at a 22% tax rate. This study extends time series analysis through 1997, finding it important to exclude 1986 from estimates. Excluding both 1986 and 1997 results in a coefficient of 2.18 and an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. Different specifications were tried, including an instrumental variables method using the top marginal tax rate, leading to an estimate of 3.8 and an elasticity of 0.84. Excluding 1997 as well, the coefficient changes to 5.13 and an elasticity of 1.13. The study analyzed different specifications with changes in tax rates, resulting in elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. However, most tax rate coefficients were not statistically significant. Despite the instability of specifications with tax rate changes, a coefficient of 2.28 is reported in Table 1. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects. The study by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects, finding an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate. Their approach is similar to panel studies from the 1980s, but their estimate is lower, possibly due to time series elements. The 2.28 coefficient reported in Table 1 reflects transitory elements and the instability of specifications with tax rate changes. The study by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) estimated permanent and transitory effects with an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression study with elasticities typically between 2 and 5, highlighting the limitations of cross-section studies in reflecting permanent realizations elasticities. The study reflects the limitations of cross-section studies in interpreting permanent realizations elasticities. It uses a 50-year panel of state data with state- and time-fixed effects to analyze changes in tax rates. The findings are not included in Table 1. The study utilizes a 10-year panel with state- and time-fixed effects to analyze the effects of changing specification on elasticities. The inclusion of year-fixed effects helps control for transitory effects from law changes. Sensitivity analysis with different specifications and time subperiods is also provided. The study includes year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes and provides sensitivity analysis with different specifications and time subperiods. It is an aggregate time series study using Australian data from 1988 to 2015, with controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index.
