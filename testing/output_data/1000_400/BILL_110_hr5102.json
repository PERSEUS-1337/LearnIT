    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. The value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion from 2000 to 2005, with containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million units. Existing and potential future trade agreements are expected to further boost international trade and worsen freight congestion. The United States has seen a significant increase in international trade, with containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million units. The country is involved in various trade agreements and negotiations, leading to further growth in trade and congestion. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, costing Americans billions of dollars annually in wasted time and fuel. Traffic congestion in the United States is a growing problem, with Americans wasting billions of hours in traffic and spending billions of dollars on fuel each year. Freight bottlenecks are also causing economic losses and delays. Significant investments are needed to maintain and improve the transportation system. To improve the transportation system's service levels, government investments of $235 billion in 2006, $304 billion in 2015, and $472 billion in 2030 are required. The Act aims to address transportation investment needs in trade corridors, reduce freight congestion, and mitigate congestion on congested routes due to international trade growth. The Act aims to address major transportation investment needs in national trade gateway corridors, reduce freight congestion along current and future trade corridors, and develop corridors to increase freight transportation system reliability and enhance the quality of life for United States citizens. Establishment and collection of national trade gateway corridor fee.
