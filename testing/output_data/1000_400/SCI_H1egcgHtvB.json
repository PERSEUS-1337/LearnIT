A unified framework based on relation-aware self-attention mechanism addresses schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation in text-to-SQL encoding. This framework improves exact match accuracy to 53.7% on the Spider dataset, compared to 47.4% for the previous state-of-the-art model. The model shows qualitative improvements in schema linking and alignment, unlocking the potential to effectively query databases with natural language. The Spider dataset framework improves exact match accuracy to 53.7%, showing qualitative improvements in schema linking and alignment. This advancement enables effective querying of databases with natural language, benefiting users not proficient in query languages. The release of annotated datasets has driven progress in translating natural language questions into SQL queries. The release of large annotated datasets with questions and corresponding SQL queries has advanced the field of semantic parsing. New tasks like WikiSQL and Spider challenge models to generalize to unseen database schemas, requiring encoding of schema information for accurate query generation. Semantic parsing for text-to-SQL models is challenging due to the need to encode schema information accurately, including column types and relationships, and align natural language references to database columns/tables. Schema linking, which aligns question references to schema elements, is a less explored challenge. The challenge of schema linking involves aligning question references to schema columns/tables, taking into account known schema relations and question context. Prior work addressed this by encoding foreign key relations with a graph neural network, but has shortcomings. The semantic parser must consider schema relations and question context. Previous work encoded foreign key relations with a graph neural network but lacked contextualization with the question and limited information propagation. Global reasoning is essential for effective relational structure representations. The semantic parser must consider schema relations and question context. Previous work encoded foreign key relations with a graph neural network but lacked contextualization with the question and limited information propagation. Global reasoning is crucial for effective relational structure representations. In this work, a unified framework called RAT-SQL is presented for encoding relational structure in the database schema and a given question. It uses relation-aware self-attention to combine global reasoning over schema entities and question words with structured reasoning over predefined schema relations, achieving 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set. The RAT-SQL framework combines global reasoning over schema entities and question words with structured reasoning over schema relations, achieving 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set. This approach enables more accurate internal representations of the question's alignment with schema columns and tables. Semantic parsing of natural language to SQL queries has gained popularity due to datasets like WikiSQL and Spider. Schema encoding is easier in WikiSQL compared to Spider because of the absence of multi-table relations. Schema linking is more challenging in Spider due to its richer natural language expressiveness and less restricted SQL grammar. The state-of-the-art semantic parser on WikiSQL achieves a test set accuracy of 91.8%, higher than Spider. Recent models for Spider use attentional architectures for question/schema encoding and AST-based structural architectures for query decoding. IRNet encodes the question and schema separately with LSTM and self-attention. The recent state-of-the-art models for Spider achieve an accuracy of 91.8%. IRNet encodes question and schema separately with LSTM and self-attention, using AST-based decoder for query decoding. Bogin et al. use a graph neural network for schema encoding and a grammar-based decoder. RAT-SQL provides a relational framework for semantic parsing. Bogin et al. (2019b) and Global-GNN by Bogin et al. (2019a) focus on schema encoding and linking in Spider dataset. Global-GNN applies global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables using a graph neural network. This differs from RAT-SQL in how question word representations influence schema representations. Global-GNN implements global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables using a graph neural network. Unlike RAT-SQL, question word representations influence schema representations, and message propagation is limited to schema-induced edges. The relation-aware transformer mechanism allows encoding arbitrary relations between question words and schema elements explicitly, computed jointly using self-attention. This approach differs from Shaw et al. (2018) as it applies relation-aware self-attention to sequences of words in machine translation. The RAT-SQL framework extends the relation-aware self-attention mechanism to encode complex relationships within unordered sets of elements, such as columns and tables in a database schema. This is the first application of relation-aware self-attention to joint representation learning with predefined and softly induced relations in the input structure. The RAT-SQL framework applies relation-aware self-attention to joint representation learning with predefined and softly induced relations in database schema and question structures. It aims to generate SQL queries from natural language questions by encoding relational structures between the question and schema. The RAT-SQL framework implements schema linking by encoding relational structures between natural language questions and database schemas, generating corresponding SQL queries. The schema consists of columns and tables, with some columns serving as primary or foreign keys. The goal is to bias the schema encoding mechanism towards these predefined relations. The schema in SQL includes primary and foreign keys, each column has a type, and schema linking aligns question words with columns or tables for SQL query generation. The alignment is modeled using an alignment matrix biased towards string-match relations. The database schema is represented as a directed graph to support reasoning about relationships between schema elements. The database schema is represented as a directed graph with nodes representing tables and columns labeled with their names and types. An alignment matrix is used to model the latent alignment between schema elements. The approach includes a tree-structured decoder and self-attention layers for reasoning about relationships between schema elements. The approach involves using a graph to represent the database schema, with nodes for tables and columns labeled with their names and types. A tree-structured decoder and self-attention layers are used for reasoning about relationships between schema elements. Initial representations are obtained for nodes and words in the input question using bidirectional LSTMs. The LSTM is used to form embeddings for nodes, while a bidirectional LSTM processes words. Initial representations are independent and later enriched with schema graph information using relation-aware self-attention. The relation-aware self-attention method is used to transform input elements in a directed graph schema representation. The encoder applies multiple layers of relation-aware self-attention with separate weights for each layer. The edge types in the graph are described after processing through the encoder layers. The encoder applies a stack of N relation-aware self-attention layers with separate weights for each layer. After processing through the encoder layers, the directed graph schema representation describes edge types present in the graph. The encoder applies relation-aware self-attention layers to process the directed graph schema representation, describing edge types present in the graph. SAME-TABLE x and y belong to the same table, with various foreign key relationships between them. Different relation types are defined and mapped to embeddings to obtain values for each pair of elements in x. The encoder applies relation-aware self-attention layers to process the directed graph schema representation, describing edge types present in the graph. Different relation types are defined and mapped to embeddings to obtain values for each pair of elements in x, including additional types beyond those listed in Table 1 for schema linking. The model uses relation types to align question text with schema columns/tables, determining exact or partial matches for n-grams in the question. The model aligns question text with schema columns/tables by determining exact or partial matches for n-grams in the question, resulting in a total of 33 types. Memory-Schema Alignment Matrix uses relation-aware attention as a pointer mechanism to capture the correspondence between columns/tables in SQL and natural language questions.

The alignment matrix is designed to reflect real alignments and encourage sparsity.

An auxiliary loss is added to encourage sparsity of the alignment matrix, strengthening the model's belief in the alignment. The decoder generates SQL queries as abstract syntax trees using an LSTM. The decoder generates SQL queries as abstract syntax trees using an LSTM, where relevant columns and tables are aligned with the question text through relation-aware attention. An auxiliary loss promotes sparsity in the alignment matrix to reinforce the model's confidence in the alignment. The LSTM encoder updates its state using previous actions and node embeddings.

Evaluation is mainly done on the development set due to limited access to the test set. The model utilizes 8 relation-aware self-attention layers during training on the Spider dataset. Evaluation is mainly done on the development set, with limited access to the test set. RAT-SQL outperforms all other methods on the hidden test set according to the dataset leaderboard. In Table 2a, RAT-SQL outperforms all other approaches on the hidden test set, coming close to beating the best BERT-augmented model. Adding BERT embeddings to RAT-SQL may lead to state-of-the-art performance. Performance drops with increasing difficulty, with a significant 15% accuracy drop on extra hard questions. Adding schema linking relations to RAT-SQL improves accuracy significantly, as shown in Table 2c. The alignment between the question and the database schema is crucial for model accuracy. The overall generalization gap between development and test sets is affected by the drop in accuracy on hard questions. The alignment between the question and the database schema is crucial for model accuracy. The alignment loss terms did not make a difference in overall accuracy in the final model, despite earlier improvements during development. Hyper-parameter tuning may have caused this change. The alignment loss terms did not impact overall accuracy in the final model, despite earlier improvements during development. Hyper-parameter tuning may have eliminated the need for explicit supervision of alignment. An accurate alignment representation has benefits, such as identifying question words for copying when a constant is needed. In Figure 4, the model alignment correctly identifies key words referencing columns in the dataset. Despite challenges in semantic parsing, the model struggles to link column/table references in the question accurately.

An oracle experiment was performed to force the decoder to make correct choices at every grammar nonterminal and terminal production.
