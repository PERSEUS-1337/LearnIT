    "content": "The House and Senate approved conference agreements on defense bills for FY1999, which were signed into law by the President on October 17. Additional defense-related funding of $8.3 billion was approved in an omnibus appropriations bill, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and equipment purchases. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) provided $8.3 billion in additional defense-related funding, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, equipment purchases, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill was signed into law by the President on October 21 (P.L. 105-277). The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) provided additional defense-related funding, including allocations for various military activities. The bill was signed into law (P.L. 105-277) on October 21, with most funding going to programs administered by the Department of Defense. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) allocated funds for national defense activities, including those administered by the CIA, DOD, and other agencies. The Administration's budget included $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress also addresses defense programs in the annual defense authorization bill, which details funding for various programs. The authorization bill addresses defense programs in line item detail, with differences between authorization and appropriations bills mainly on a few programs. Congressional debate on defense policy and funding occurs mainly in the authorization bill. Congress completed action on defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. House and Senate allocated funds to subcommittees in May. The final status of action on authorization and appropriations bills for defense programs was completed on October 1. House and Senate allocated funds to subcommittees in May, with final allocations slightly below the Administration's request for defense but above for military construction. The final Senate and House allocations for defense programs are slightly below the Administration's request for defense but above for military construction. The House approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill on May 6. See Table B-1 in Appendix B for allocations of all defense discretionary funds. The House and Senate approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill with amendments in May and June. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill in September, and it was signed into law in October. The FY1999 defense authorization bill was approved by the House and Senate in May and June, with the Senate passing the bill on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill in September, and it was signed into law in October. The House and Senate approved the FY1999 defense appropriations bill, with the Senate passing the bill on July 30. Conferees reached agreement on the bill in September, and it was signed into law on October 17 as P.L. 105-262. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill was approved by the House and Senate in September and signed into law on October 17 as P.L. 105-262. Additionally, supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved in April for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, and other purposes. In FY1998, supplemental funding for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, and other purposes was approved by the House and Senate. The bill, signed into law as P.L. 105-174, provided $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, with allocations for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. Defense-related supplemental appropriations for FY1999 were also approved in October. In FY1998, supplemental funding of $393 million was allocated for disaster relief and $513 million for other defense programs. In FY1999, an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) provided $8.3 billion in additional defense-related funding, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug efforts. In FY1999, additional funding of $8.3 billion was allocated for defense-related purposes, including Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug efforts. The bill also includes emergency appropriations for various defense programs and makes rescissions of $67 million. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill resolved major issues including relations with China, with the conference agreement dropping language banning satellite exports. China was a contentious issue in Senate debate, with several China-related provisions being dropped during floor debate. The Senate-passed bill included contentious China-related amendments by Senator Hutchinson, which were dropped during floor debate. The authorization conference agreed to provisions shifting technology export review to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certified not to harm the U.S. space launch industry or enhance China's missile capabilities. The conference agreement includes provisions on satellite sales to China, waiving human rights limits, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certified not to harm the U.S. space launch industry or enhance China's missile capabilities. It also includes a measure prohibiting the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to a Chinese shipping company. The appropriations conference agreement does not include a measure condemning forced abortions in China. The appropriations conference agreement does not include a revised amendment by Senator Hutchinson condemning forced abortions in China. It also contains provisions on satellite sales to China, prohibiting missile equipment exports, and prohibiting the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to a Chinese shipping company. The Senate did not approve new rounds of military base closures as requested by the Administration. The Senate approved an amendment making it more difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a base closure process. DOD objected but the provision was dropped in the conference agreement. The House bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate bill prohibited new policies until a commission reports. The Senate rejected a proposal to separate men and women in basic training, opting to continue current integrated practices with additional steps for separate sleeping quarters. The House-Senate conference ultimately adopted the Senate's language but included a statement urging separate training units. The House-Senate authorization conference adopted the Senate language with a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The authorization bill also included measures on exemplary behavior for commanders and rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. Additionally, the House bill aimed to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons, potentially requiring new facilities in South Carolina at an estimated cost of $3 billion. Tritium production: The House-passed bill prohibits DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, potentially requiring new facilities in South Carolina costing $3 billion over 40 years. The Senate bill allows DOE to choose the long-term option, with a one-year review period by Congress. Active duty end-strength: The House bill rejects the Administration's request to eliminate floors on active duty levels. The conference agreement allows DOE to choose the long-term option for tritium production, with a one-year review period by Congress. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels. The Senate approved an amendment to increase the military personnel pay raise to 3.6%. The authorization bill initially provided a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel, which was increased from the requested 3.1% by an amendment in the Senate. This increase was offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The conference agreements ultimately settled on a 3.6% pay raise. Additionally, the Senate approved funding for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding not subject to the defense spending cap. The appropriations conference agreements provide a 3.6% raise for military personnel. The Senate approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding, while the House bill did not include the requested funding. There were debates on capping Bosnia spending and withdrawing U.S. troops, with the Senate rejecting measures for troop withdrawal by a specific date. The authorization conference agreement included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with the option to spend an additional $100 million to protect U.S. troops. The Senate version also encouraged the President to establish conditions for a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The appropriations conference agreement did not provide emergency funding for Bosnia initially, but it was later included in a supplemental appropriations measure for FY1999. The authorization conference agreement capped Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with an option for an additional $100 million for troop protection. The appropriations conference agreement initially did not include emergency funding for Bosnia but later provided it in a supplemental appropriations measure for FY1999. Contentious weapons issues were minimal, with funds allocated for 7 C-130J aircraft despite objections from the Administration. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced in the House and Senate appropriations bills. The House and Senate authorization and appropriations bills added over $400 million for 7 additional aircraft, exceeding the requested amount. Funding for the THAAD system was significantly reduced after a test failure in May, with the authorization conference agreement cutting $294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cutting $376 million. The Senate bills also reduced or eliminated funding for the MEADS system, a cooperative program with allies that the Administration wants to continue. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills cut funding for the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, including the Medium Extended-Range Air Defense System (MEADS). The authorization conference agreement reduced funding from $44 million to $24 million and prohibits expenditure unless MEADS is included in future budget plans. The appropriations conference agreement only provides $10 million. Funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program was also reduced, while funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D was increased. The Administration objected, but the authorization conference agreement followed the Senate's lead. The appropriations conference agreement provided slightly more funding for ABL. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills reduced funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for new aircraft carrier development, while the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million out of the $190 million requested. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills included advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for new aircraft carrier development, while the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million out of the $190 million requested. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills included advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, with $50 million and $45 million allocated respectively. The House and Senate disagreed on the number of new F/A-18E/F aircraft to procure, with 30 F-18s and one F-16 funded in the authorization and appropriations conferences. The Administration objected to a requirement in the Senate authorization bill regarding F-22 aircraft testing before additional procurement contracts are signed. The House added funds for two unrequested F-16 aircraft, while the authorization and appropriations conferences funded 30 F-18s and one F-16. The Administration objected to certain testing requirements for the F-22 aircraft in the Senate authorization bill. Additionally, there were disagreements over cuts in other areas to finance increases in certain programs, but the authorization conference agreement made smaller cuts. The battle over B-2 bomber procurement and the requirement for a design competition in the New Attack Submarine program seem to have been resolved. The authorization conference agreement made smaller cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs. Long-term weapons issues like the B-2 bomber procurement and New Attack Submarine program seem to have been resolved. Both House and Senate bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to healthcare, with pilot projects testing alternative approaches like the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The Senate and House approved pilot projects to test alternative approaches for military retirees' healthcare, including joining the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) and accessing TRICARE pharmacy benefits. Other key matters in the defense debate included military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, efficiency measures, and military readiness. Key matters in the defense debate included military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, efficiency measures, military readiness, long-term funding for defense modernization, military personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues, military health care policy, and Year 2000 computer problems. The FY1999 defense budget was constrained by the 1997 budget agreement, leading to a \"zero-sum game\" in Congress. Any additions to favored programs or rejected reductions had to be offset by cuts in other defense areas. This marked a departure from previous years where Congress had added significantly to defense spending. The defense debate in Congress for the FY1999 budget involved a \"zero-sum game\" where any increases in favored programs or rejected reductions had to be balanced by cuts in other defense areas. Congress ultimately added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, leading to potential confrontation with the Administration over defense priorities. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress involved potential conflicts over defense priorities. Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the appropriations bill, leading to a contentious debate over priorities within the defense. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on programs of ongoing interest. Key priorities included fully funding national missile defense development, increasing funding for National Guard and Reserve equipment, funding all defense health program costs, and advancing funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to FY2001. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress focused on key priorities such as national missile defense development, National Guard and Reserve equipment funding, defense health program costs, and advancing funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to FY2001. The debate did not result in significant conflicts over priorities, with only small amounts allocated for unrequested weapons programs. The Quadrennial Defense Review from the previous year also influenced the congressional defense debate. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress focused on key priorities such as national missile defense development, National Guard and Reserve equipment funding, defense health program costs, and advancing funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to FY2001. The debate did not result in significant conflicts over priorities, with only small amounts allocated for unrequested weapons programs. The Quadrennial Defense Review from the previous year also influenced the congressional defense debate, with additional funds added for ballistic missile defense. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report highlighted important themes for ongoing discussion in Congress. The Defense Reform Initiative report and the National Defense Panel report highlighted key themes for ongoing discussion in Congress, including a revised U.S. defense strategy, the need to prevail in two major theater wars, and measures to reduce pressures on the force. Both reports emphasized the importance of efficiency to save money for weapons modernization. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative, and National Defense Panel reports emphasized the need for increased efficiency to save money for weapons modernization. They also called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense, preparing for different threats, and investing in experimental force exercises and new technology. The National Defense Panel called for a shift in focus towards homeland defense and preparing for future threats, recommending an increase of $5 to $10 billion annually for experimental force exercises and new technology. Additionally, they proposed two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs, with Secretary Cohen pushing for approval in 2001 and 2005. The Defense Department proposed two more base closure rounds in 1999 and 2003, but Congress was not receptive. Secretary Cohen prioritized approval for closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. A report reaffirmed that previous closure rounds will save $5.6 billion annually, with future rounds projected to save $2.8 billion each. These savings are crucial for defense modernization programs. The Defense Department proposed two more base closure rounds in 1999 and 2003, but Congress was not receptive. Resistance to additional closures was fueled by objections to the Administration's actions after the 1995 round. The 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities, but the White House opted for privatization instead. The 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities in Sacramento, California, and San Antonio, Texas. The White House chose to privatize the facilities instead, allowing private contractors to bid for contracts. This decision led to competition for contracts and better prices, but some Members of Congress felt it politicized the base closure process. Last year, a dispute over ensuring public facilities receive enough work delayed the defense authorization bill, and this Spring, lawmakers raised concerns about an Air Force memo discussing a White House request. The Administration's decision to privatize Air Force facilities in Sacramento and San Antonio led to competition for contracts and better prices. However, some Members of Congress criticized the politicization of the base closure process. Secretary Cohen suggested including a prohibition on privatization in future base closure legislation and advocated for more base closures to be approved in preparation for the long-term defense plan. Secretary Cohen has proposed including a prohibition on privatization in future base closure legislation and urged Congress to approve more base closures to prepare for the long-term defense plan. Congressional action on additional military base closures has been limited, with the Senate rejecting a proposal for one more closure round in 2001. Senator Inhofe's amendment, approved by the Senate, would make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without congressional approval. The Senate rejected a proposal for one more base closure round in 2001, despite predictions that Congress will approve it next year. An amendment by Senator Inhofe to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without congressional approval was ultimately dropped. Additionally, the Administration requested $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia. The Administration requested $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia and extended the mission through FY1999 with an additional $1.9 billion requested. Funding was provided in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) for Bosnia operations. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia operations through FY1999 in H.R. 4328. Congress debated designating the funding as \"emergency\" to avoid cuts in other defense programs. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia operations through FY1999 in H.R. 4328. Congress debated designating the funding as \"emergency\" to avoid cuts in other defense programs. The proposal to provide the funding without offsetting cuts was contentious, breaking a precedent set by Congress in previous years. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 in addition to the regular defense funding. Congress debated designating Bosnia funding as emergency appropriations to avoid cuts in other defense programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations, while the House National Security Committee set a cap of $1.9 billion with an additional $100 million available for emergencies to protect U.S. troops. The full House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations after setting a cap of $1.9 billion for FY1999 with an additional $100 million for emergencies. The Senate approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia but rejected a proposal to cut off funds without congressional approval. The Senate rejected an amendment to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without congressional approval but approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels. Senator Stevens proposed an amendment to provide $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The White House threatened a veto if this provision was included. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The Senate voted to table a similar amendment. The White House threatened a veto if the provision was included. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security needs. The Skaggs amendment was dropped in the appropriations conference agreement. The appropriations conference agreement does not include emergency funding for Bosnia, leaving the issue for later consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. Requested emergency funding of $1.9 billion for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Relations with China, technology exports, and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan were key focuses of congressional attention. In the wake of allegations regarding LoralSpace Corporation's assistance to China in missile technology, congressional attention shifted to trade sanctions legislation and export controls. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China, including limitations on missile and satellite technology exports. The White House strongly opposed these measures. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China, including limitations on missile and satellite technology exports. The White House strongly objected to these measures, which also included provisions related to the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. In the Senate, several China-related amendments were proposed, leading to a debate on China policy being postponed. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer his amendments during the defense appropriations bill discussion. The Senate rejected China-related amendments proposed by Senator Hutchinson, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Stevens postponed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments. Eventually, a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to officials involved in forced abortions passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement omitted House language banning technology exports to China. The revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill passed unanimously, requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation. The authorization conference agreement included provisions shifting technology export review from Commerce to State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. The conference agreement includes provisions on satellite sales to China, waiving human rights-related limits, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. Efficiency measures recommended include staff reductions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters. The QDR and Defense Reform Initiative recommend efficiency measures such as reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cutting civilian and military support personnel, and promoting public-private competitions for activities currently done by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce overhead activities while imposing barriers to reducing civilian personnel levels. Key issues include determining the real impact of cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel, potential requirements for deeper cuts in overhead personnel, and addressing barriers to reducing civilian personnel levels. The Defense Department is facing challenges in reducing overhead activities and civilian personnel levels. Congress is debating the impact of cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel, potential deeper cuts in overhead personnel, and privatization measures at local facilities. The House has pushed for significant reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have sought to soften these measures. Congressional action includes urging the Defense Department not to waive cuts. The House and Senate are debating cuts in acquisition personnel and overhead activities at the Defense Department. The House has proposed significant reductions, while the Senate and Administration are seeking to soften these measures. Congressional action includes urging the Defense Department not to waive cuts and imposing a $500 million cut in funding for consultants. The White House has objected to these cuts, citing concerns about restricting DOD's ability to pursue efficiencies. The House proposed cuts in acquisition personnel and overhead activities at the Defense Department, including a $500 million reduction in funding for consultants. The White House objected to these cuts, citing concerns about restricting DOD's efficiency efforts. The authorization conference agreement includes measures to withhold funds unless DOD meets requirements, cuts acquisition personnel, reduces consultant funding, and decreases Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Congressional focus on military readiness has highlighted various issues such as shortages in spare parts and equipment. The House proposed cuts in acquisition personnel and overhead activities at the Defense Department, including a $500 million reduction in funding for consultants. Military readiness has been a focus of intense attention in congressional hearings, with concerns about shortages in spare parts and equipment. Members of Congress have raised issues such as a drop in Army standards for new recruits and shortfalls in key skill areas. Administration officials acknowledge some problems but insist there is no overall readiness crisis. Some believe there is an imminent readiness crisis due to inadequate defense funding and the Clinton Administration's extensive overseas missions. Administration officials acknowledge some issues but deny an overall readiness crisis, stating that early deploying units are fully ready. They attribute reported problems to inaccurate anecdotes and claim that overall readiness remains high, with ongoing efforts to address issues like Air Force engine spares shortages and pilot retention. Officials in the services have expressed concerns about personnel recruitment and retention, with growing readiness problems identified by senior military officers during a meeting with the President on September 15. Officials in the services have expressed concerns about personnel recruitment and retention, with growing readiness problems identified by senior military officers during a meeting with the President on September 15. The Joint Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 28, highlighting a need for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring funding for maintenance and mandating changes in readiness reporting. The Senate approved additional defense spending after the Chiefs identified shortfalls of up to $135 billion over five years. Congressional action included restructuring maintenance funding and mandating changes in readiness reporting. Amendments were made to require reports on food stamp use by military families and to acknowledge that readiness has been affected by budget cuts and expanded missions. The Senate approved additional defense spending to address identified shortfalls, including restructuring maintenance funding and mandating changes in readiness reporting. Amendments were made to require reports on food stamp use by military families and acknowledge the impact of budget cuts and expanded missions on readiness. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, focusing on recruiting, troop benefits, flight duty pay, and quality of life measures. However, changes to military retirement benefits for personnel retention were not included. Long-term funding for defense modernization remains a concern. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, but did not address changes to military retirement benefits. Long-term funding for defense modernization is still a concern, with funding being reallocated from weapons procurement to readiness-related accounts. The requested procurement funding for FY1999 is $48.7 billion, similar to the previous year. The FY1999 budget faces challenges as funding for weapons procurement is being reallocated to readiness-related accounts. The requested procurement funding is $48.7 billion, close to the previous year's level. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001 without raising overall defense spending, which may be difficult based on historical trends. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001 without raising overall defense spending, which may be challenging due to historical trends and potential obstacles such as base closure savings, weapons maintenance costs, quality of life requirements, contingency operation costs, health care cost growth, and other expenses. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001 without raising overall defense spending. However, reaching this target is being hindered by various factors such as base closure savings, weapons maintenance costs, quality of life requirements, contingency operation costs, health care cost growth, and other expenses. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler noted the challenges in meeting the procurement target. Congressional action shows no substantial increases in modernization funding, with only $1 billion allocated for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. Military personnel end-strength levels are also being reduced as part of efficiency savings mandated by the QDR. The QDR mandated a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, mainly from support activities. Congress has shown resistance to personnel cuts, citing strains on active duty forces from contingency operations. The Army faces shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists for major conflicts but facing burdens in smaller-scale operations like Bosnia. The Army has long faced shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists for major conflicts but facing burdens in smaller-scale operations like Bosnia. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors on active duty personnel levels to carry out QDR reductions. The Administration requested a reduction of more than 35,000 active duty personnel from the authorized FY1998 level. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors on active duty personnel levels to carry out QDR reductions. The Administration requested a reduction of more than 35,000 active duty personnel from the authorized FY1998 level. Some Members of Congress disagreed with this request, leading to debates in HNSC and SASC. Ultimately, the authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request. Additionally, there were discussions about National Guard and reserve issues following the QDR. The SASC approved end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. House and Senate defense appropriations bills assumed cuts in end-strength in FY1999. A dispute between the active Army and Army National Guard over the role of Guard combat units emerged after the QDR. Congress approved special advisors for Guard and Reserve officers. The Defense Department requested more funding for Guard and reserve issues. The Defense Department has requested more funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, while the Army Chief of Staff is working to ease a dispute with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added money for Guard and reserve weapons programs and has appointed special advisors for Guard and Reserve officers. The Defense Department has requested increased funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, with Congress adding substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces. Disputes over major weapons programs, including Missile defense programs, have been a recurring issue in Congress. Funding for National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD) programs has become less contentious following the QDR. The Administration increased funding for NMD programs to protect against long-range missile attacks. Policy disputes remain unresolved, with advocates in Congress pushing for early deployment of a nationwide defense system. Disputes over TMD systems, like THAAD, also continue. The Administration increased funding for NMD programs to protect against long-range missile attacks. Policy disputes persist over the deployment of a nationwide defense system, with advocates in Congress pushing for early implementation. Disputes also continue over TMD systems like THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS, with delays in THAAD development due to test failures and procurement prioritization. Congressional action has previously included provisions for nationwide defense deployment. MEADS, a cooperative program with European allies, aims to improve air/missile defense for troops. Congressional action includes provisions for nationwide defense deployment, with recent focus on S. 1873 for a nationwide defense system. Senate failed to pass the bill despite attempts. Congress also addressed TMD programs earlier in the year. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873, \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for nationwide defense deployment. Congress approved additional funding for TMD programs, including $147 million in FY1998 and $179 million in the FY1998 supplemental funding bill. The House-passed FY1999 authorization included extra funding for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The SASC version added funding for the Navy Theater Wide program but slightly reduced THAAD. The supplemental funding bill, H.R. 3579, includes $179 million for TMD programs. The Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to test failures and delays in engineering development. The House approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program by selecting a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering development to technology. The House approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program by selecting a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering development to technology. The Senate appropriations bill also made cuts to MEADS funding and the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program, while increasing funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. Additionally, the Senate appropriations bill added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) cut funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser (ABL) program by $97 million and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. They also added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. Congressional defense committees endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD, with budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The authorization conference cut THAAD by $294 million and reduced MEADS funding by $19 million to $24 million, prohibiting further expenditures until included in long-term defense budget plans. Additionally, the agreement followed Senate increases in the Space Based Laser program and cut the Airborne Laser by $57 million. The House defense appropriations bill reduced funding for THAAD by $376 million, MEADS to $10 million, and the Airborne Laser by $25 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill included an additional $1 billion for missile defense with no specific allocation. Some Members of Congress proposed procuring 9 more B-2 bombers, with the House generally in support and the Senate opposed. The B-2 bomber procurement battle seems to be coming to an end as no additional funding is being added for more bombers. Instead, there are limited funds for B-2 upgrades while new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production. None of this year's defense bills add money for more B-2 bombers, potentially marking the end of the B-2 battle. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development: the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter program. DOD has requested funding for these programs in FY1999, with concerns raised about the cost of the F-22 in the Senate. Members of Congress debate whether all three programs can be afforded or if one should be canceled. The QDR studied three defense programs - Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter. Despite reductions, all programs were continued. Congress debated affordability, with concerns about the cost of the F-22. HNSC and HAC reduced F/A-18E/F procurement, while SASC required completion of 10% of planned flight tests for F-22 before further funding. The Senate rejected a Bumpers amendment to require 601 hours of flight testing before the next round of procurement for the F-22. The authorization conference included funds for 30 F-18s and allowed a waiver for the flight test requirement for the F-22. Congress has added funds to shipbuilding programs to avoid gaps in production and ensure shipyards have enough work. One major issue concerns the procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class ship. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been a major issue. The Department of Defense has moved up the planned procurement to FY2001 to avoid costly gaps in production. Newport News Shipbuilding had proposed an accelerated funding plan called \"Smart Buy\" to save the Navy money, but the new DOD plan will not save as much. The new DOD plan, in response to Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal, aims to avoid production gaps and save costs for the Navy. Additionally, concerns about the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer have led to agreements between shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form competing teams for combat systems. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form competing teams for combat systems. They have also abandoned plans for a new-design aircraft carrier and will focus on incremental improvements to Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine. The House and Senate approved the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine.

The authorization conference agreement added $50 million for advance procurement of a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship, built by Ingalls Shipbuilding Company in Mississippi. The Navy decided not to pursue a new design for the CVX carrier, leading to debates on funding allocation for carrier R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in funding for CVX R&D and an increase for CVN-77 upgrades. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in funding for CVX R&D and a $50 million increase for CVN-77 upgrades. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for the CVX by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement provided $110 million for CVX R&D. The Administration did not request funding for additional F-16 aircraft in the FY1999 budget. The conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D and $105 million for other weapons issues. Congress has supported a low level of F-16 procurement to maintain production lines and meet Air Force requirements. Funding for JSTARS aircraft was also a concern, with Congress considering restoring the original procurement plan. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft.

The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) allocated additional funds for advance procurement or termination costs for JSTARS, as well as funding for more C-130s and Guard and Reserve equipment. The contentious issue of C-130J funding led to debates in Congress. Rep. Obey proposed reallocating funds to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. The authorization conference agreement includes funding for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement funds for JSTARS, and $60 million for Guard and Reserve equipment. Rep. Obey proposed reallocating funds from C-130J to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. The appropriations conference agreement provides funds for C-130s, $36 million for JSTARS advance procurement, and $140 million for Guard and Reserve equipment. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons that may not be effective against future threats. They recommended reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs and focusing on advanced technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. Specific programs criticized include the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, and Comanche helicopter programs. The Defense Department should reduce or terminate \"legacy\" programs and focus on leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility.

Senator Brownback proposed an amendment to insert the House language, but the Senate approved a Snowe substitute allowing current practices. The House and Senate were at odds on gender-integrated training. HNSC also required the Secretary of Defense and the President to display exemplary conduct. The House and Senate were in disagreement over gender-integrated training in the authorization bill. The agreement allowed current unit training practices to continue but required separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. It also emphasized the need for senior officials to uphold exemplary standards.

Despite initial approval, the House Republican caucus later decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, leading to the removal of the $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The House Republican caucus rejected emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, leading to the removal of $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. Funding for Y2K conversion in the Defense Department was addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The defense authorization bill approved funding for Department of Energy weapons-related activities, while DOE funding was provided in the energy and water development appropriations bill. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy weapons-related activities and Department of Defense activities. A key issue in the bill concerns tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs. The House-passed authorization bill includes a measure to prohibit DOE from buying tritium from commercial sources, potentially requiring new facilities in South Carolina. The cost estimates for tritium procurement range from $3 billion over forty years from commercial sources to $10 billion from other sources. The Senate-passed authorization bill allows DOE to choose between buying tritium from commercial sources or building new facilities in South Carolina. The conference agreement permits DOE to make the decision but delays implementation for a year for congressional review. Senator Kyl has objected to this provision, believing it is urgent for DOE to pursue a new tritium source.
