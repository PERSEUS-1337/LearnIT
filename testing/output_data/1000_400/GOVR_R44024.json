    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amended TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process. Since 1976, Congress has added titles and amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to address specific chemical concerns, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills introduced since 2005 aim to revise the chemical evaluation process, but there is ongoing legislative debate on amending regulatory controls and criteria. Despite more chemicals entering the market and increased scientific understanding of chemical risks, few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated under TSCA. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework for chemicals under TSCA is not sufficiently protective, as few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated. States have enacted statutes to address specific chemical concerns not covered by EPA, leading to potential differences in regulations among states. Manufacturers and processors have raised concerns about compliance with varying state regulations. EPA's evaluation of risks is limited by available resources. Manufacturers and processors argue that complying with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient due to interstate commerce. Proponents of state regulations believe states should lead in trying alternative approaches to protect citizens. Non-governmental programs like labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic\" offer alternative regulation methods. This report tracks bills in the 114th Congress that would amend regulations. In the 114th Congress, bills have been introduced in both chambers to amend Title I of TSCA. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) was introduced on March 10, 2015, and referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Non-governmental programs like labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic\" offer alternative regulation methods. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were introduced in the 114th Congress to amend Title I of TSCA. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for S. 697, which was reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. House Committee on Energy and Commerce also took action on related environmental issues. Senate EPW marked up an amendment for S. 697 on April 28, 2015, and it was reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 on April 7, 2015. The subcommittee held a hearing on April 14, 2015, and ordered the revised draft to be forwarded to the full House Committee on Energy and Commerce on May 14, 2015. On June 23, 2015, the House passed H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, with amendments, by a vote of 398-1, following approval by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce approved the bill with technical amendments on a 47-0 vote. The House passed H.R. 2576 on June 23, 2015, with a 398-1 vote. Key debated topics include prioritizing existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting substances, EPA's options for regulation, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, disclosure protection, and resource allocation. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address regulatory options for chemical substances, EPA's authority to require new information, preemption of state laws, disclosure protection, and resource allocation for administering the act. EPA's discretion in evaluating chemical risks and the need for criteria in selecting chemicals for evaluation are key issues under the current TSCA. Under the current TSCA, EPA has discretion in selecting chemicals for evaluation based on certain criteria. Over 83,000 chemical substances are potentially subject to evaluation, with more than 1,200 identified in 2012 under EPA's TSCA Work Plan. In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for evaluation under TSCA Work Plan. From these, 90 were prioritized based on hazard and exposure criteria. EPA has assessed five of these chemicals, finding three to present risks. Manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing new chemicals under Section 5 of TSCA. EPA evaluates risks during this period. EPA has assessed five of the 90 prioritized chemical substances, finding three to present risks. Manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing new chemicals under TSCA Section 5. EPA evaluates risks during this period and has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications. S. 697 and S. 725 prioritize existing chemical substances for evaluation, while H.R. 2576 directs EPA to evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. EPA has discretion to evaluate chemicals identified as having risks. The EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications. S. 697 and S. 725 prioritize existing chemical substances for evaluation, while H.R. 2576 directs EPA to evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. H.R. 2576 gives EPA discretion to evaluate chemicals with potential risks. Both Senate bills establish a process to prioritize substances for evaluation based on various factors. The Senate bills aim to prioritize existing chemical substances for evaluation by dividing them into active and inactive substances, conducting risk-based safety evaluations, and taking regulatory action based on the results. Both bills also address the prioritization of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances, with slightly different approaches. Manufacturers and processors can request EPA to prioritize certain substances for evaluation by paying a fee, with EPA having discretion to grant a limited number of requests under S. 697. The Senate bills S. 697 and H.R. 2576 establish a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee. EPA has discretion to grant requests under S. 697, while H.R. 2576 requires evaluation for substances where costs are paid. S. 697 and S. 725 set deadlines for evaluating substances and taking regulatory actions, with EPA required to designate substances as high or low priority in a timely manner. EPA must publish an annual goal and designate at least 25 substances. The prioritization process under S. 697 and S. 725 sets deadlines for evaluating chemical substances, designating them as high or low priority, and conducting safety assessments. EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessments within five years. Safety assessments must be completed within three years, with a rule promulgated within two years after a negative safety determination. The procedures are generally comparable between the two bills, with tighter deadlines and differing conditions and procedures for prioritization. H.R. 2576 sets tighter deadlines for risk evaluations compared to S. 725, requiring them to be published within three years after a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk. EPA must initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year under H.R. 2576, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they cover the evaluation costs. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to conduct at least 10 risk evaluations per year, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they cover the evaluation costs. S. 697 and S. 725 would establish a process for EPA to review new chemical substances and significant new uses. The Senate bills propose changes to the current process for EPA to evaluate risks of new chemicals, requiring a determination within 90 days of receiving a PMN. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would undergo similar safety assessment procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA establishes a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Some argue that this threshold is challenging for the EPA to demonstrate. Some argue that the existing regulatory threshold for restricting chemical substances in TSCA is challenging for the EPA to demonstrate, leading to debates on amending the criteria for regulatory control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is not clearly defined in statute, but has been interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the circuit court. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the circuit court, requiring the EPA to consider costs and impacts before regulatory actions. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately, leading to a conclusion that spending $200-$300 million to save seven lives over thirteen years was not reasonable under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA. The court emphasized the need to balance costs and benefits when regulating substances under the current TSCA framework. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" that uses the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA and adds some qualifiers, including considering \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" among the general population with respect to an evaluation of risks. S. 697 and S. 725 both define a \"safety standard\" for evaluating chemical risks, with S. 697 explicitly including \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" and prohibiting the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors.\" S. 725 aims to ensure no harm to human health or the environment without considering cost or non-risk factors. The safety standard in S. 725 aims to ensure no harm from exposure to a chemical substance, similar to evaluating pesticide residues in food. In contrast, H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, such as assessing risks to potentially exposed populations. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors in decision-making. The EPA uses Section 6(a) of TSCA to address unreasonable risks by balancing costs and benefits. If a chemical poses an unreasonable risk, EPA must implement the least burdensome requirement to mitigate the risk, considering factors like cost and availability of alternatives. Regulatory options range from a complete ban to notifying distributors of risks. The EPA must implement the least burdensome regulatory requirement to mitigate unreasonable risks posed by chemicals under Section 6(a) of TSCA. This can range from a complete ban to notifying distributors of risks, considering factors like cost and availability of alternatives. In practice, the \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the chosen alternative. The EPA must implement the least burdensome regulatory requirement to mitigate unreasonable risks posed by chemicals under Section 6(a) of TSCA. This additional standard goes beyond conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the chosen alternative. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome requirement for EPA when restricting chemical substances, opting for a regulatory option deemed \"necessary\" for meeting safety standards. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 would remove the EPA's obligation to choose the least burdensome regulatory option for restricting chemical substances. Instead, they would require the EPA to select a regulatory option deemed \"necessary\" for meeting safety standards, taking into account factors like costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 would also mandate rules to adequately protect against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations, and require them to be cost-effective unless impractical to do so. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 propose changes to EPA regulations on chemical substances, including factors for restrictions and cost-effective rules. EPA may exempt certain chemical uses if they pose national security risks or lack safer alternatives. H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific chemical uses if deemed necessary to avoid harm to national security, the economy, or critical infrastructure. Exemptions would be in effect for up to five years and renewable if criteria are met. EPA aims to reduce risks to the greatest extent feasible. EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for up to five years, renewable if criteria are met. The agency relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and may require testing if risks are insufficiently known. EPA can mandate manufacturers and processors to conduct testing under Section 4 of TSCA. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) mandates reporting and record-keeping of chemical information by manufacturers, processors, and distributors. EPA can require testing if risks are unknown, based on threshold findings of unreasonable risks or significant human exposures. Over 200 chemical substances have undergone additional testing under TSCA. Some argue for limits on EPA's authority to require new information development. EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances under TSCA. Some argue that limits on EPA's authority to require new information development have hindered risk assessment. EPA faces challenges in determining unreasonable risk without new information, often relying on production volume and exposure likelihood. Developing new information can be time-consuming. The EPA faces challenges in determining unreasonable risk for chemical substances under TSCA due to limited authority to require new information development. While EPA has required testing for over 200 chemicals, the process can be time-consuming and costly. Proposed legislation would give EPA discretion to require testing if deemed necessary for risk evaluation purposes. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 would authorize EPA to require testing for risk evaluation purposes, with differences in the criteria for when testing can be mandated. The bills aim to minimize animal testing and address the issue of TSCA preemption amidst increasing state chemical regulations. The TSCA amendment would require EPA to minimize animal testing and address the issue of TSCA preemption in light of increasing state chemical regulations. Congress can preempt state action in the field of chemicals, giving EPA a primary role but allowing states some flexibility under certain circumstances. The TSCA amendment gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some flexibility under certain circumstances. States are generally preempted from taking action if EPA has already addressed a similar risk, with exceptions for certain state requirements. States can co-enforce federal requirements, regulate disposal, and establish their own chemical requirements under certain conditions. In the context of TSCA amendments, advocates argue that federal preemption can create a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals, preventing conflicting state regulations and reducing compliance costs. Advocates argue that a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals can provide sufficient protection from risks by preventing conflicting state regulations and reducing compliance costs. Opponents believe states should be able to implement more stringent policies to protect their citizens, while S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management by changing the EPA actions triggering preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements and the scope of state laws that would be preempted or excepted from preemption. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals that meet EPA safety standards or have been restricted by EPA. S. 697 would restrict states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority by EPA for safety assessment within EPA's defined scope. Preemption would depend on EPA's determination of whether the chemical meets safety standards. S. 697 would restrict states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority by EPA for safety assessment within EPA's defined scope. Preemption would depend on EPA's determination of whether the chemical meets safety standards. The bill would retain preemption exceptions provided by current TSCA, remove the exception allowing states to prohibit chemical use, refine the exception allowing states to enforce identical requirements, and add new exceptions allowing states to establish or enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. S. 697 would refine preemption provisions to prohibit states from imposing duplicative or more stringent penalties or sanctions, with exceptions for certain state actions and allowing states to establish requirements under state environmental laws. The bill would also add savings clauses to protect common law or statutory causes of action and allow states to apply for waivers based on peer-reviewed science concerns about a chemical. EPA would be required to grant waivers meeting statutory requirements. The proposed legislation would allow states to apply for waivers based on scientific concerns about a chemical, with EPA required to grant waivers meeting statutory requirements. State laws could be preempted if they conflicted with federal requirements, but states would generally be allowed to impose and enforce different regulations for chemicals. The proposed legislation would allow states to impose and enforce different regulations for chemicals, with state laws potentially preempted if they conflicted with federal requirements. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption compared to Senate bills, maintaining preemption of state requirements based on EPA risk management actions. H.R. 2576 aims to align TSCA's preemption of state requirements with EPA risk management actions for chemicals, including penalties for enforcing state requirements identical to EPA's. State prohibitions on chemical use would no longer be exempt from preemption. H.R. 2576 aligns TSCA's preemption of state requirements with EPA actions, allowing states to enforce identical requirements with penalties. It also includes savings clauses for common law causes of action and aims to balance chemical information submission with health and safety concerns. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers to submit information to EPA, including chemical structures and safety data. Section 14 prohibits disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information, with penalties for wrongful disclosure. Under TSCA, EPA protects information classified as \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information\" from disclosure under FOIA. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal offense, but health and safety studies can be disclosed unless they reveal manufacturing processes or proprietary mixtures. Certain exceptions require disclosure if necessary to protect health or the environment. Under TSCA, EPA protects confidential business information (CBI) to safeguard health and the environment. Exceptions for disclosure include situations where it is necessary to protect against unreasonable risks. Submitters can designate information as CBI without requiring substantiation or EPA review. CBI protection remains unless EPA determines otherwise. The EPA protects confidential business information (CBI) under TSCA, allowing submitters to designate information as CBI without substantiation or EPA review. CBI protection continues indefinitely unless EPA determines otherwise. EPA has increased review of confidentiality claims since 2010, including a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims. All three bills aim to retain current TSCA's framework for protecting information falling under FOIA exemptions. The EPA has initiatives to increase public access to non-confidential information, including a \"CBI Declassification Challenge.\" The three proposed bills would require or authorize EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances, such as in response to requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, environmental releases, or healthcare professionals for patient diagnoses and treatments. The Senate bills would make more extensive revisions to TSCA Section 14 than H.R. 2576. The Senate bills propose more detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and additional review requirements for EPA under TSCA Section 14. They also outline categories of information presumed protected from disclosure, including specific chemical identity before commercial distribution. In contrast, H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting chemical identities in health and safety studies. The Senate bills propose procedural requirements and review processes for information submitters under TSCA Section 14. H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting chemical identities in health and safety studies, requiring substantiation of confidentiality claims every 10 years. EPA's evaluation of chemical risks depends on available resources, raising the question of funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations. EPA must notify submitters before confidentiality claims expire under H.R. 2576. Congress faces a decision on funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or dedicated sources. Funding for TSCA has been continued through annual appropriations, with the option for EPA to assess fees on chemical manufacturers. EPA continues to fund TSCA implementation through annual appropriations and has the authority to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. The fees are limited to a maximum of $2,500 for certain actions under Section 5 of the statute, with an exception for small businesses capped at $100. The EPA requires submission of new chemical substances to EPA for significant new uses. Fees for evaluating testing data are capped at $100 for small businesses under Section 26(b) of TSCA. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization. Fees collected under Section 26(b) of TSCA are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under Section 29 of TSCA, while H.R. 2576 would not amend Section 29. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under Section 26(b) to varying degrees, with S. 697 conditioning fee collection on a minimum level of discretionary appropriations. S. 697 would authorize the collection of fees to accompany submissions of information to EPA for chemical evaluations, with fees set to provide sustainable funding. The total amount collected would be capped at $18 million, deposited in a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions without fiscal year limitation. The bill H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for chemical risk evaluations, with no annual cap specified. Fees would be deposited in a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions, without fiscal year limitation. EPA would collect fees sufficient to cover costs of administering TSCA, with no statutory limit on the amount collected per submission. The bill would eliminate the current statutory limit for EPA fees per notice submission, allowing the agency to collect fees sufficient to cover TSCA administration costs. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 would establish a fund for fee receipts without fiscal year limitation. Fees from chemical manufacturers would be set at a level to enable EPA to fulfill its responsibilities. S. 725, similar to S. 697 and H.R. 2576, would eliminate the statutory limit on EPA fees per notice submission under TSCA. Fees collected would be deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, with funds subject to discretionary appropriations. Congressional Budget Office cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576 are available in respective reports."
