    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate among countries, with many wintering in Latin America and the Caribbean. These neotropical migratory birds provide valuable benefits to the environment, economy, and recreation. However, their populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation, putting their long-term survival at risk. The decline in neotropical migratory bird populations is primarily due to habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and contamination. Conservation efforts require the commitment of all countries along their migration routes, and increased coordination can enhance existing initiatives. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and foster international cooperation for these initiatives.
