The credit amount is determined based on the Internal Revenue Code, with a percentage of the allowable federal credit applied without considering federal tax liability. Adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California. Income brackets dictate the credit percentage, ranging from 63% for $40,000 or less to 0% for over $100,000. Different income brackets have different credit percentages, with the highest being 200% for $100,000 or less and decreasing as income increases.

Earned income subject to tax under this part includes compensation for active services in the Armed Forces, excluding pensions or retired pay. For tax purposes, compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is considered earned income subject to tax in California, regardless of the member's domicile. The definition of a qualifying individual for tax purposes is modified to include children as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes, a child shall be treated as a qualifying individual if they receive over one-half of their support from the parent with custody for a greater portion of the year. This parent is considered the \"custodial parent\" under the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments to the tax law regarding child support and custody apply to specific taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. This act enacts a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
