    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act.\" It includes amendments to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, specifically changing Section 302 regarding findings. The Congress finds that youth who are homeless or run away from home without parental permission are at risk of serious health and behavioral problems.
