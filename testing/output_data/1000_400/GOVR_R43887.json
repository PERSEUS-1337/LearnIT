Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse. Most programs are administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services, except for Title V which is administered by the Department of Labor. Title V, Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA), is administered by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. Congress has reauthorized the Older Americans Act (OAA) multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 2006 authorizing appropriations through FY2011. The Older Americans Act (OAA) has been reauthorized and amended by Congress multiple times. The last reauthorization in 2006 extended authorizations of appropriations through FY2011.
