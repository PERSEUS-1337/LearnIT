The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in Vietnam, particularly at airbases like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat. The A Luoi Valley was also significant as part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail used by North Vietnamese forces. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in Vietnam, including at airbases like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat, as well as the A Luoi Valley. The former U.S. military base in the A Luoi Valley is another contaminated area. U.S. response to the environmental damage caused by Agent Orange and dioxin in Vietnam has helped improve bilateral relations between the two nations. President Obama pledged continued support in addressing the legacy of war during a meeting with President Tran Dai Quang in May 2016. The U.S. has been addressing health issues caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam, improving bilateral relations. President Obama pledged continued support in a meeting with President Tran Dai Quang in May 2016, including removing landmines and cleaning up dioxin contamination at Danang Airport and Bien Hoa Air Base. Vietnam welcomed cooperation for dioxin remediation at Danang Airport and the cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. The joint statement after the meeting highlighted Vietnam's cooperation in dioxin remediation at Danang Airport and the ongoing cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. The United States pledged to assist Vietnam in addressing Agent Orange/dioxin issues, continuing past commitments. President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc affirmed their commitment to work together on war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation and removal of unexploded ordnances. The joint statement between Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc emphasized their commitment to addressing war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation at Danang Airport and ongoing efforts at Bien Hoa Air Base. The US has allocated $254.8 million for environmental remediation and health programs related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam. The US and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Intent in 2018 to start dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for environmental remediation and health programs related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam since 2007. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam from the Department of Defense to USAID under the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The 115th Congress authorized funds transfer for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam from the Department of Defense to USAID. Funds are allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund and Development Assistance accounts for environmental remediation and health programs. USAID is responsible for fund administration. Environmental remediation focuses on Danang airport cleanup, while health funds support disability programs in Danang. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been delegated responsibility for administering funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam. The cleanup of Danang airport has been completed, with plans for joint dioxin removal operations at Bien Hoa airbase. Discussions are ongoing regarding addressing health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure among Vietnamese nationals. Programs are managed by the State Department and USAID in collaboration with Vietnamese government agencies. The two governments are discussing addressing health and disability problems among Vietnamese nationals due to dioxin exposure. Programs funded by appropriated funds are managed by the State Department and USAID in cooperation with various Vietnamese government ministries and agencies. Vietnam's central government created Office 33 to oversee its policy on Agent Orange and dioxin, which includes representatives from several ministries. Office 33 in Vietnam coordinates government policy on Agent Orange and dioxin, involving various ministries. Congressional interest focuses on allocating funds for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas, as well as overseeing State Department and USAID spending. The U.S. government allocated funds for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. Congressional oversight is focused on ensuring effective use of these funds by the State Department and USAID. The U.S. government allocated funds for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and health programs near contaminated sites. The State Department decided to handle the $3 million appropriation through USAID, setting a precedent for future assistance. The 111th Congress later appropriated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup and related health services in Vietnam. The 111th Congress allocated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and related health services. This included $3 million in March 2009, $3 million in December 2009, and $12 million in July 2010 for remediation at the Danang Airport. Additionally, the State Department and USAID provided $1.9 million for environmental remediation at Danang in FY2010. The 111th Congress allocated $18 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and related health services, including $12 million for remediation at Danang Airport in July 2010. The State Department and USAID also provided $1.9 million for environmental remediation at Danang in FY2010. The 113th Congress endorsed a plan for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam within 180 days after the enactment of the law. The 113th Congress directed USAID to develop a comprehensive plan for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam within 180 days. Subsequent Congresses continued to appropriate funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam. The 113th Congress directed USAID to develop a plan for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam. Subsequent Congresses appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, including $22.0 million for environmental remediation and $7.0 million for health and disability programs in affected areas. Funds were also allocated for dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and assistance for the Government of Vietnam, including the military, under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. Funds allocated for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and assistance for the Government of Vietnam, including the military, under the Economic Support Fund and Development Assistance. $7.5 million for Vietnam health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation of dioxin. In P.L. 114-113, funds were allocated for environmental remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health/disability programs for individuals affected by Agent Orange. The report specified not less than $25 million for environmental remediation and $7 million for health/disability programs to address the needs of individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities. Funding for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam was allocated in P.L. 114-113. Not less than $25 million was provided for environmental remediation and $7 million for health/disability programs to address the needs of individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities. The Committee intended for health/disability funds to be implemented by Vietnamese organizations to maximize impact. Funding for FY2017 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), with $20,000,000 allocated for dioxin remediation activities. Funding for FY2017 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) allocated $20,000,000 for dioxin remediation in Vietnam and $10,000,000 for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Act allocates not less than $10,000,000 for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination, providing assistance to individuals with mobility and cognitive disabilities. It allows for the first time the provision of aid to the Government of Vietnam for dioxin remediation. The 115th Congress previously allocated $20 million for remediation activities in Vietnam. In March 2018, the 115th Congress allocated not less than $20 million for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam, with funds available for assistance to the Government of Vietnam. In addition, not less than $10 million was allocated for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange, aiding individuals with mobility and cognitive disabilities. In February 2019, the 116th Congress allocated not less than $20 million for similar activities in Vietnam. In February 2019, the 116th Congress allocated funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health programs for individuals with mobility and cognitive disabilities. USAID is responsible for the funds' obligation. The State Department has designated USAID as the responsible agency for the obligation of funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam. USAID has obligated significant amounts of funds for environmental remediation projects and health- and disability-related services from FY2007 to FY2017. The allocation and obligation of funds by USAID have been a matter of concern for Congress. USAID has obligated $20.3 million out of $21 million for environmental remediation or health- and disability-related services from FY2007 to FY2011. Congress has raised concerns about the pace and types of programs funded for health and disability activities. Since FY2007, Congress has appropriated funds for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam. Concerns have been raised about the slower pace of utilization compared to environmental remediation funds and the types of programs being funded. For example, $3 million was allocated in FY2007 for health programs in communities near contaminated sites. The Senate report accompanying P.L. 111-8 allocated $3 million for environmental remediation of dioxin contamination at Danang Airport in Vietnam. H.Rept. 112-331 recommended at least $5 million for health/disability activities in Agent Orange-contaminated areas. It is uncertain if all funds were used as directed, with funds in FY2010-FY2013 mainly going to Development Alternatives, Inc. for disability programs. In FY2010-FY2013, health and disability funds were largely obligated to Development Alternatives, Inc. for a disability support program. This program aimed to improve the lives of persons with disabilities without specific reference to Agent Orange/dioxin \"hot spots.\" USAID returned to directly obligating funds for health- and disability-related services in smaller amounts in FY2014, increasing outreach to Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations. USAID's three-year program in Vietnam ended in January 2016. Following consultations with various parties, USAID shifted to smaller direct program funding for health- and disability-related services. One significant project funded by congressional appropriations is the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, which has faced delays and increased costs since 2008. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam, experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The project, initially planned for completion by October 2013, was finished in August 2017. The decontamination volume grew from 61,700 m3 to 90,000 m3, with an additional 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" Costs escalated from $33.7 million to over $110 million. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam, experienced delays, increased decontamination material, and rising costs. The project, initially planned for completion by October 2013, was finished in August 2017. The decontamination volume grew to approximately 90,000 m3, with an additional 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" Costs escalated from $33.7 million to over $110 million. The joint military/civilian airport in Danang was a major operational hub for the U.S. military's Operation Ranch Hand, with soil concentrations exceeding international maximum standards. Work on the project began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam, experienced delays, increased decontamination material, and rising costs. Seventeen out of 23 soil samples at Danang airbase exceeded international maximum standards. Work began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. USAID and Office 33 were designated as implementing agencies, with $6.0 million in funds appropriated for the project. Among the activities included was a grant to design an environmentally sound engineering approach to dioxin containment at Danang airport. In FY2009, a grant was given to CDM International, Inc., in partnership with Hatfield Associates, to design an environmentally sound engineering approach for dioxin containment at Danang airport. An Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption to decontaminate 61,700 m3 of material at a cost of $33.7 million. A Memorandum of Intent was signed in December 2010 between USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence to start the remediation project in 2011 and complete it by October 2013. The remediation project at Danang airport, approved by the Prime Minister and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence, involved in-pile thermal desorption. USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for project oversight and construction components, totaling $25.37 million. The project was launched in July 2012. Environmental remediation of Danang airport by IPTD. CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. were awarded contracts totaling $25.37 million for project oversight, construction management, and excavation components. Onsite work began in August 2012, with thermal desorption of contaminated soil done in two phases. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project, including an assessment of Bien Hoa airbase. The environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport involved thermal desorption of contaminated soil in two phases. Phase 1 treated 45,000 m3 of soil, removing over 95% of dioxin by April 2015. Phase 2 began in January 2015, treating another 45,000 m3 of soil, completed in August 2017. The decontamination of Danang airport began in April 2014, with Phase 1 completed by April 2015 after removing over 95% of dioxin. Phase 2 started in January 2015, treating 45,000 m3 of soil, and was finished in August 2017. Progress was delayed due to weather conditions, increased soil testing requirements, and technical issues with the treatment facility. The thermal treatment area required more soil decontamination than estimated. The secondary treatment facility was shut down in July 2014 for system changes. Raising the soil temperature to 335\u00b0C took longer than expected. An internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 identified risks like inclement weather and cooling treated soil. The audit recommended implementing a formal risk management plan due to inaccurate performance data provided by CDM. The audit highlighted the lack of a formal risk management plan to address project risks identified by USAID and contractors. It also mentioned inaccurate performance data from CDM and the need for more training for Vietnamese officials. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took more time and money than initially projected due to underestimating the contamination, with 162,500 cubic meters of soil found to be contaminated instead of 72,900 cubic meters. USAID's environmental remediation unit noted that dioxin had percolated three meters deeper than expected. USAID has utilized funds for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with dioxin as part of its support program for persons with disabilities in Vietnam. The dioxin contamination at Danang Airport was deeper than expected, requiring more time and money for remediation. USAID has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, including funds for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized funds for health services for grants between FY2007 and FY2010. Between FY2007 and FY2010, the State Department and USAID provided funds for health services in areas near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites to assist disabled Vietnamese. A December 2010 USAID assessment noted accomplishments but highlighted the short timeframe for meeting program objectives. In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH). In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be jointly implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH). The program aimed to build on previous accomplishments in Danang and include public health activities. The project's focus was primarily in Danang, with needs assessments planned in Bien Hoa and Phu Cat. Initial funding for PDSP was set at $9 million. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, focused on providing assistance to persons with disabilities in Danang and other high-need areas in Vietnam. DAI awarded grants for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. USAID also supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs. The program operated in provinces with dioxin \"hot spots\" such as Phu Cat, Danang, and Bien Hoa. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, focused on providing assistance to persons with disabilities in high-need areas in Vietnam. USAID supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs. The program operated in provinces with dioxin \"hot spots\" like Phu Cat, Danang, and Bien Hoa, and has been extended to other provinces. Nearly US$900,000 in grants were awarded to local partners and organizations. In June 2014, USAID adopted a new approach to assisting persons with disabilities in Vietnam. USAID provided nearly US$900,000 in grants to 14 local partners and organizations in Vietnam to assist persons with disabilities. In June 2014, USAID adopted a new approach to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities. This includes providing physical, occupational, and speech therapies, as well as training to Vietnamese practitioners. USAID will finance physical, occupational, and speech therapies for persons with disabilities in high-prevalence and poverty areas in Vietnam. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue are targeted for these programs. USAID will directly administer the new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. The Aspen Institute has identified several heavily sprayed provinces in Vietnam, including Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue. USAID will directly administer a new approach in these areas, with a focus on environmental cleanup efforts at the Bien Hoa airbase, a dioxin \"hot spot\" from the war. The Vietnamese government has already taken some mitigation measures in response to high dioxin levels found in soil samples at the airbase. The Bien Hoa airbase in Vietnam was heavily sprayed with herbicide during the war, leading to high dioxin contamination levels in soil samples. The Vietnamese government has implemented some mitigation measures, including a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" at the airbase have not been addressed, with contaminated soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The airbase in Vietnam has dioxin \"hot spots\" that have not been addressed, with contaminated soil spreading into nearby water bodies. A study by Hatfield Consultants found the contamination had spread into lakes, ponds, creeks, and drainage ditches. The UNDP, Office 33, and MONRE have been working on a dioxin remediation plan for the airbase, estimating 250,000 m3 of soil needing decontamination at a cost of $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to assess dioxin remediation alternatives at the airbase in 2013. In 2014, a joint investigation estimated that 250,000 m3 of soil at the Bien Hoa airbase needed decontamination, costing at least $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. in 2013 to assess dioxin remediation options. The final environmental assessment report in 2016 revealed 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils nearby, with five treatment methods considered, costing between $137 million to $794 million. The estimated costs for remediation methods at Bien Hoa Airbase range from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations of 40% less to 75% more. Over $3.7 million has been allocated for environmental assessment. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has begun infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at the airbase with a budget of $11.8 million. According to USAID, $3.7 million has been allocated for assessing environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has started infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at the airbase with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to begin the decontamination process. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam expressed eagerness to collaborate on this initiative. The United States and Vietnam signed a memorandum of intent to work together on a remediation program for Bien Hoa airport. A $183 million aid agreement was signed for decontamination, with an estimated total cost of $390 million and a projected timeline of 10 years. Approximately 500,000 cubic meters of soil are to be decontaminated. In September 2018, a memorandum of understanding was signed with a Japanese contractor for construction. At the time of the agreement signing, the project at Bien Hoa airport was estimated to take 10 years and cost $390 million. A memorandum of understanding was signed with Japanese contractor Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory. The factory will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate soil at a rate of 40 tons per hour, costing half as much as previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site in October 2018, reaffirming America's commitment to remediate past issues. The technique at Bien Hoa airport is expected to cost half as much as previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site in October 2018, reaffirming America's commitment to remediate past issues. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam focuses on providing assistance for environmental damage and oversight of aid utilization. The focus on Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam is on providing assistance for environmental damage and oversight of aid utilization. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in affected areas. The Trump Administration has shown support for Agent Orange projects in Vietnam. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in affected areas. President Obama's budget requests did not explicitly include funding for health and disability assistance programs related to Agent Orange or dioxin contamination. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues past practices. President Obama's budget requests to Congress did not include funding explicitly for health and disability assistance programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for these programs, with a minimum of $12,500,000 allocated for individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to direct further assistance. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) allocates at least $12,500,000 for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. Assistance will be provided to individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities, including medical care, nursing services, vocational training, and medical equipment. The Act directs the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs to provide aid to those affected by Agent Orange exposure. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 allocates funds for health care needs of Vietnamese residents affected by Agent Orange exposure between 1961 and 1975. Assistance includes medical services, vocational training, and home repairs. The Act also supports research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure.

It also supports research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure and provides assistance to institutions in Vietnam that offer healthcare for affected individuals. Additionally, the Act aims to remediate areas in Vietnam with high levels of Agent Orange contamination, prioritizing heavily sprayed areas and military bases where Agent Orange was handled. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 prioritizes heavily sprayed areas and military bases for environmental remediation and health services. The Act requires reports from the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs on its implementation. Congress oversees funding utilization for Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated locations in Vietnam. Congress oversees the implementation of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019, focusing on funding utilization for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam. Congressional oversight includes monitoring the rising costs of cleanup efforts at Danang airport and the slow pace of fund obligation by USAID for related health services. USAID's provision of health services and environmental remediation in Vietnam has faced scrutiny from Congress due to slow fund obligation and cost overruns. The cost of Danang airport cleanup increased from $33.7 million to $116 million, leading to concerns about funding a similar project at Bien Hoa airport. Despite challenges, USAID managed to keep the Danang project going, but struggled to effectively utilize funds for health services in contaminated areas. USAID faced challenges in effectively utilizing funds for health services in contaminated areas in Vietnam. Despite managing to keep the Danang airport cleanup project going, there were concerns about the rising costs and delays. Observers question the effectiveness of the health services funds and whether they align with congressional priorities. Some observers question the effectiveness of health services funds in Vietnam and whether they align with congressional priorities. Congress has included language in legislation indicating funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, with specific amounts usually stipulated in accompanying reports or statements."
