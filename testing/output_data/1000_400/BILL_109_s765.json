Congress finds that the United States needs a robust scientific and technical enterprise, requiring more scientists and engineers. The education system must encourage students to study science and mathematics, as current performance lags behind international peers. The US must recommit to investing in research and development to secure a prosperous future. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, including nanotechnology advancements. A program of loan forgiveness can attract students to careers in these fields and help maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program for loan forgiveness to attract students to careers in science, mathematics, and engineering fields. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for undergraduate students who meet specific criteria outlined in the Act.
