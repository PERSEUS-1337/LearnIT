The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a new model that combines evidence from multiple documents. It includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with respect to the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module that scores candidate answers by comparing their occurrences across all documents with the query. Using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention, the CFC achieves a state-of-the-art result of 70.6% accuracy on the Qangaroo WikiHop task, outperforming previous models by 3%.

It uses hierarchies of coattention and self-attention to emphasize different parts of the input, outperforming previous models by 3%. Existing datasets have focused on localized sections of a single document for neural question answering systems. However, this work introduces multi-evidence QA, where answering questions requires aggregating evidence from multiple documents. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a model inspired by coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning, selecting answers from support documents and a query. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a QA model that selects answers from support documents and a query using coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning. It employs hierarchical attention to combine information from support documents and candidates, achieving state-of-the-art results on blind Qangaroo. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) utilizes hierarchical attention to combine information from support documents and candidates, achieving state-of-the-art results on blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy. It outperforms previous models by 3% accuracy and improves exact match accuracy and F1 score on TriviaQA task. The attention hierarchies of the coarse and fine-grain modules focus on distinct parts of the input. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) improves accuracy by 3.1% and F1 by 3.0% by reranking outputs from a span extraction model. The attention hierarchies of the CFC focus on distinct parts of the input, enabling better representation of long documents. Common errors in CFC include difficulty in aggregating references, noise in supervision, and challenging relation types. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules correspond to different reasoning strategies. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) improves accuracy and F1 by reranking outputs from a span extraction model. The CFC's coarse-grain module summarizes support documents using coattention and self-attention, while the fine-grain module retrieves specific contexts for each candidate. This division of labor allows attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input, enabling effective representation of potentially long support documents. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) improves accuracy and F1 by reranking outputs from a span extraction model. It builds codependent representations between mentions and the query, allowing attention hierarchies in each module to focus on different parts of the input for effective representation of potentially long support documents. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) uses bidirectional GRUs to encode sequences and employs coattention to build codependent representations of support documents and queries. This technique is crucial for single-document question answering models. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) utilizes coattention to create interdependent representations of support documents and queries. This technique is essential for single-document question answering models. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) uses coattention to create interdependent representations of support documents and queries. Softmax(X) normalizes X column-wise to obtain the document context. The coattention context is a concatenation of the document context and the document summary vector. Coattention takes document and query encodings to produce the coattention context. Hierarchical self-attention is used to summarize the coattention context, creating a fixed-length summary vector. A multi-layer perceptron is used to compute scores for each position of the coattention context, which are then normalized and used to compute a weighted sum. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) utilizes a multi-layer perceptron to compute scores for each position of the coattention context. These scores are normalized and used to calculate a weighted sum over the context, generating a summary vector. Self-attention is applied to produce a fixed-length summary vector of all support documents, which is then combined with the candidate answer's summary to generate the coarse-grain score. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) uses self-attention to create a summary vector of support documents, which is then combined with the candidate answer's summary to calculate the coarse-grain score. The fine-grain module identifies the specific context of the candidate in the support documents using coreference resolution. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) utilizes self-attention to generate a summary vector of support documents. The fine-grain module identifies the specific context of the candidate in the support documents through coreference resolution and computes coattention between mention representations and the query to produce a fine-grain summary for scoring the candidate. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) uses self-attention to summarize support documents. It identifies candidate context through coreference resolution and computes coattention with the query to score the candidate based on mention representations. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) uses self-attention to summarize support documents and score candidates based on mention representations. The model combines fine-grain and coarse-grain scores to generate a final score vector for each candidate, which is then used for training and evaluation on multi-evidence question answering tasks. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) combines candidate scores to form a final score vector for training and evaluation. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multi-evidence question answering tasks like WikiHop and TriviaQA. The WikiHop dataset links entities in Wikipedia with Wikidata to create a bipartite graph for study. The CFC model, proposed by Clark & Gardner (2018), significantly improves performance using the CFC results. The Qangaroo WikiHop task, introduced by Welbl et al. (2018), involves linking entities in Wikipedia with Wikidata to create a bipartite graph. This graph represents knowledge base fact triplets as paths from subject to object, with support documents along the path. The task requires selecting a plausible candidate object from a set based on the query provided. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves selecting the correct candidate answer from a set of plausible candidates based on a query. Support documents are provided for the candidates, and the task uses both unmasked and masked versions to evaluate performance. Tokenization is done using Stanford CoreNLP, and fixed GloVe embeddings are used along with character ngram embeddings. Symbolic query relations are split into words for modeling. The CFC achieves state-of-the-art results on both masked and unmasked versions of WikiHop, with a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind, held-out test set. This surpasses the previous state-of-the-art result by Cao et al. (2018) using pretrained contextual encoders. The CFC model achieves a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind, held-out WikiHop test set, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art result by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The division of labour between the coarse-grain and fine-grain modules allows for more effective modeling of long documents in WikiHop. Additionally, experiments on TriviaQA show the effectiveness of the model. The fine-grain module in the CFC model enables attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input, improving modeling of long documents in WikiHop. Experimentation on TriviaQA involves decomposing tasks into proposing candidate answers and reranking them. Ablation study on WikiHop dev set shows the impact of different model components. The ablation study on the WikiHop dev set analyzed the impact of various model components on performance. Reranking using the CFC consistently improved performance over using only the span extraction question answering model, regardless of the candidate answer set obtained. BiDAF++ utilizes the answer candidate with the highest F1 score for training the CFC, resulting in performance gains when reranking. The CFC improves model performance even when the candidate answer set from the span extraction model contains incorrect answers. Overall, reranking with the CFC on the TriviaQA dev set leads to a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 increase. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules, along with model decisions like self-attention and bidirectional GRUs, significantly contribute to model performance. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules, along with model decisions like self-attention and bidirectional GRUs, contribute significantly to model performance. Replacing self-attention layers with mean-pooling and bidirectional GRUs with unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation.
