    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products. Courts have ruled consumers lack standing to enforce the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act provision on goods made with forced or convict labor. The Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits importation of goods made with forced or convict labor, with exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. There have been fewer than 40 enforcement actions in the past 80 years. Federal mechanisms to prevent forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in supply chains lack scope and information. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act addresses these issues. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 aim to terminate Federal contracts with contractors engaging in severe forms of trafficking or forced labor. This addresses the lack of information about goods produced with forced labor in supply chains imported by the United States. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 prohibits Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking in persons or forced labor. Executive Orders and legislation further strengthen protections against trafficking in Federal contracts. Executive Order 13126, Executive Order 13627, and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 have prohibited Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. These orders and Acts also require contractors to disclose accurate information about employment conditions. The Executive Order and Acts prohibit Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities and require them to disclose accurate information about employment conditions. It is the sense of Congress that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are egregious forms of abuse for commercial profit. It is the sense of Congress that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are among the most egregious forms of abuse committed for commercial profit. Legislation is needed to prevent goods produced by these means from entering the US market and to provide consumers with information on products free of these practices. Businesses and consumers can avoid supporting these crimes through transparent disclosures. Legislation is necessary to inform consumers about products free of child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Public disclosures can help businesses and consumers avoid supporting these crimes in supply chains. SEC. 3.
