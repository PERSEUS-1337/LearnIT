    "content": "Deconvolutional layers are commonly used in deep models for up-sampling, but they can lead to the checkerboard problem due to the lack of direct relationships among adjacent pixels. To address this, the PixelDCL is proposed to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. This method can replace deconvolutional layers without compromising the original models' capabilities, although it may slightly decrease efficiency. The PixelDCL method offers a fresh interpretation of deconvolution operations, allowing for direct relationships among adjacent pixels in up-sampled feature maps. While it may slightly decrease efficiency, this can be overcome with an implementation trick. Experimental results show that PixelDCL improves spatial feature consideration and segmentation accuracy compared to traditional deconvolutional layers. Deep learning methods, including deconvolutional layers, are used in various AI tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and image generation. Deconvolutional layers are crucial for up-sampling feature maps in deep models but suffer from checkerboard artifacts, limiting their capabilities. In this work, a new method called PixelDCL is proposed to address the checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution operations, which limit the capabilities of deep models in generating realistic images and smooth outputs for semantic segmentation. The method aims to improve the up-sampling process by providing a fresh interpretation of deconvolution operations. The PixelDCL method addresses checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution operations by introducing the pixel deconvolutional layer. This layer ensures that adjacent pixels on the output feature map are directly related, overcoming the problem of checkerboard artifacts. The PixelDCL method introduces pixel deconvolutional operation to address checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution. This new layer generates intermediate feature maps sequentially to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the output feature map. Despite a slight decrease in computational efficiency, experimental results show that this can be largely overcome by an implementation trick. The PixelDCL method introduces pixel deconvolution to address checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in overcoming this issue and improving predictive and generative performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and image generation.

The method is related to PixelRNNs and PixelCNNs, which are generative models considering relationships among units on the same feature map. Training time is comparable to other generative models like GANs, but prediction time is slower as images are generated pixel by pixel. Deconvolutional layers can be replaced in a plug-and-play manner with PixelDCL, overcoming efficiency issues with an implementation trick. These layers are commonly used in deep models for tasks like semantic segmentation and generative models. The up-sampled output feature map is created by shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations. Deconvolutional layers in decoders are used for up-sampling by shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations. The standard deconvolutional operation can be decomposed into several convolutional operations depending on the up-sampling factor. The up-sampled output is generated using a deconvolutional layer, where convolutional and shuffling operations are applied. The deconvolutional layer in decoders up-samples intermediate feature maps through convolutional operations and shuffling. The intermediate feature maps are generated independently, with no direct relationship between them. The periodical shuffling operation results in adjacent pixels on the output feature map coming from different intermediate feature maps. The deconvolutional layer in decoders up-samples feature maps through convolutional operations and shuffling, leading to checkerboard artifacts. To address this issue, pixel deconvolutional operation is proposed to create direct dependencies among adjacent pixels. The pixel deconvolutional operation is proposed to solve the checkerboard artifact problem in semantic segmentation by adding direct dependencies among adjacent pixels.

In iPixelDCL, dependencies among intermediate feature maps are added to make adjacent pixels on output feature maps directly related to each other, improving network trainability. The purple feature map is generated from the input feature map, while the orange feature map depends on both the input feature map and the purple map. The green feature map relies on the input, purple, and orange maps, and the red feature map is based on all previous intermediate feature maps. PixelDCL introduces a new approach where only the first intermediate feature map depends on the input feature map, leading to improved network trainability. The orange feature map is now only conditioned on the purple feature map, while the green feature map relies on both the purple and orange feature maps. The red feature map is generated based on the purple, orange, and green intermediate feature maps. PixelDCL introduces a novel approach where each subsequent feature map only depends on the previous one, improving network trainability. Experimental results show that models with simplified dependencies outperform those with complete connections, indicating that repeated dependencies on the input may not be necessary for optimal performance.

The proposed pixel deconvolutional method improves performance in semantic segmentation and image generation tasks compared to traditional deconvolution. Experimental evaluation on PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015 datasets shows consistent performance enhancement in supervised and unsupervised learning settings. In semantic segmentation tasks, pixel deconvolutional methods are used to predict labels for each pixel without post-processing. The U-Net architecture BID23 is employed with four blocks in the encoder and decoder paths, each decoder block containing a deconvolutional layer followed by two convolutional layers. The final output layer is adjusted based on the number of classes in the dataset, with PASCAL 2012 having 21 classes and MSCOCO 2015 having 81 classes. The U-Net model in semantic segmentation tasks uses deconvolutional layers in the decoder path to adjust the output based on the dataset's number of classes. For datasets like PASCAL 2012 with 21 classes and MSCOCO 2015 with 81 classes, the number of feature maps is doubled in each layer for the latter to accommodate more output channels.

The dataset used for image generation is CelebA, with images preprocessed to retain only facial information. The image generation task is to reconstruct faces excluding backgrounds. Experimental Setup: The CelebA dataset is used for image generation, with images preprocessed to focus on facial information. The task is to reconstruct faces without backgrounds using a 64x64x3 image size. A standard VAE is used as the base model, with PixelDCL replacing deconvolutional layers in the decoder. The kernel size in DCL is 6x6, while PixelDCL uses 2 sets of 3x3 and 1 set of 2x2 kernels. Comparing generated faces, the baseline model shows checkerboard artifacts, while PixelDCL does not. PixelDCL, with its unique kernel sizes, eliminates checkerboard artifacts in generated images by establishing direct relationships among adjacent pixels. This approach produces photo-realistic images without the common checkerboard problem, making it very useful for generative models.

It is beneficial for generative models, as shown in sample face images generated by VAEs. The use of PixelDCL for up-sampling in U-Net models slightly increases training and prediction time compared to DCL, but offers more efficiency due to reduced dependencies. In this work, PixelDCL is proposed to solve the checkerboard problem in deconvolutional layers by adding direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps. The model using PixelDCL is more efficient than iPixelDCL and DCL in terms of training and prediction time, as it generates intermediate feature maps sequentially. This increase in time is not significant and is not expected to be a major bottleneck.
