The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles but increasing the blending limit raises concerns about emission control device failure and engine performance. The Congress is concerned about the effects of increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline on vehicle engines, including potential issues like engine failures, decreased performance, consumer complaints, litigation, and harm to conventional vehicles. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels exceeding the current blending limit to warn consumers of potential harm. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels exceeding the current blending limit of ethanol into gasoline to warn consumers of potential harm. A Federal testing regimen is underway to determine the effects on newer motor vehicles of increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline. Insufficient data exists on the effects of this increase on older vehicles and nonroad engines, but the executive branch has statutory authority to proceed with the process. The executive branch has the authority to increase the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline for older vehicles and nonroad engines. Congress should address any negative impacts on interstate commerce from this decision. SEC. 3. TARGETED LIABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR CLAIMS RELATED TO ETHANOL IN FUEL.
