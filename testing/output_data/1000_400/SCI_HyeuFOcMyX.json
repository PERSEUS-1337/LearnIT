The model generates planner codes to guide the output words, improving translation performance. By manipulating the planner codes, translations with different structures can be achieved. Planning ahead is shown to enhance translation quality and ensure grammatical correctness in human speech. The study introduces a planning phase in neural machine translation to improve translation performance by controlling sentence structure. Evidence suggests that planning ahead enhances translation quality and ensures grammatical correctness in human speech. The research introduces a planning phase in neural machine translation to improve translation performance by controlling sentence structure. The model lacks a planning phase during sentence generation, leading to uncertainty in word prediction. The proposed framework inserts planner codes at the beginning of output sentences to govern the sentence structure. The proposed framework introduces planner codes at the beginning of output sentences to control sentence structure in neural machine translation. These codes help disambiguate uncertain information about the sentence structure, such as the order of nouns and pronouns, ultimately improving translation performance. The framework introduces planner codes to control sentence structure in neural machine translation, improving translation performance by disambiguating uncertain information. Planner codes are learned through a discretization bottleneck in an end-to-end network, allowing for manipulation of output sentence structure. The framework introduces planner codes to control sentence structure in neural machine translation, improving translation performance by disambiguating uncertain information. Planner codes are learned through a discretization bottleneck in an end-to-end network that reconstructs sentences with both source and target codes. Experiments show improved translation performance with structural planning, allowing for manipulation of output sentence structure. The text introduces structural annotations to describe sentence \"big picture\" and planner codes to control sentence structure in neural machine translation, improving performance by disambiguating uncertain information. The annotations simplify POS tags of target sentences and the planner codes remove uncertainty in sentence structure during translation. The text introduces structural annotations and planner codes to improve neural machine translation performance by simplifying POS tags and removing uncertainty in sentence structure. The code learning model computes discrete codes based on POS tags and discretizes them into approximated one-hot vectors using Gumbel-Softmax trick. The code learning model computes discrete codes based on simplified POS tags, which are then discretized into approximated one-hot vectors using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. The model combines information from the input and codes to initialize a decoder LSTM for sequential prediction of tags. The architecture is depicted in Fig. 2 as a sequence auto-encoder with an extra context input X to the decoder. The code learning model predicts tag probabilities using a forward LSTM and affine transformations. The model architecture includes a context input X to the decoder. Planner codes are obtained for target sentences in the training data, which is then modified to include planner codes before training a regular NMT model with beam search decoding. The dataset consists of (X, Y) sentence pairs, with planner codes (CY) added to create (X, CY; Y) pairs. A regular NMT model is trained using the modified dataset, with beam search used during decoding. Various methods have been proposed to improve syntactic correctness in translations, such as restricting the search space with a lattice and incorporating target-side syntactic structures explicitly. Several methods have been proposed to improve syntactic correctness in translations, including incorporating target-side syntactic structures explicitly. Some approaches involve training NMT models to generate linearized constituent parse trees or to generate words and parse actions simultaneously. Other works focus on learning discrete codes for different purposes, such as compressing word embeddings by learning concept codes to represent each word. Some methods focus on learning discrete codes for different purposes, like compressing word embeddings to represent each word.

Evaluation is conducted on translation tasks with various language pairs using specific tools and training techniques, such as Kytea BID15 and moses toolkit BID8. The model uses bytepair encoding and Nesterov's accelerated gradient for training. Different settings of code length N and code types K are tested, showing a trade-off between accuracy in reconstructing source sentences and guessing correct codes. The study explores the trade-off between accurately reconstructing source sentences and guessing correct codes in a neural machine translation (NMT) model. A balanced trade-off is found with N=2, K=4 settings. The NMT model includes bidirectional LSTM encoders, LSTM decoders, Key-Value Attention, residual connections, and dropout. The NAG optimizer is used for training the NMT models. The study uses Key-Value Attention and residual connections in the NMT model, with a dropout rate of 0.2. The NAG optimizer is employed for training, with parameters chosen based on a validation set. Conditioning word prediction on planner codes improves translation performance, but applying greedy search on Ja-En dataset results in lower BLEU scores compared to the baseline. Beam search followed by greedy search was also attempted. The study explores the impact of different search strategies on translation performance. While conditioning word prediction on planner codes generally improves translation, applying greedy search on Ja-En dataset leads to lower BLEU scores. Beam search followed by greedy search did not significantly change results. The importance of exploring diverse candidate translations simultaneously is highlighted, with manual selection of codes also considered.

Predicting structural annotations directly can degrade performance. Adding a planning phase in neural machine translation generates planner codes to control structure. In this paper, a planning phase is added to neural machine translation to generate planner codes that control the structure of the output sentence. An end-to-end neural network with a discretization bottleneck is designed to predict simplified POS tags of target sentences. The proposed method improves translation performance and allows for sampling translations with different structures using different planner codes. The planning phase helps remove uncertainty in sentence structure and can be extended to plan other latent factors.
