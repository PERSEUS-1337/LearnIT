    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000. The majority of job losses occurred after November 2008, with a small uptick in employment in November 2009. Private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs rising to 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been most affected by job losses, while some service-providing industries like education and health services have continued to add workers. The manufacturing and construction industries have been heavily impacted by job losses, with the financial activities sector also experiencing declines due to the housing market collapse. Despite some industries like education and health services adding workers, overall job losses have outweighed gains in the service-providing sector since the recession began in December 2007. The real estate and construction industries have been negatively affected by the housing market collapse, leading to job losses in the financial activities sector. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, historical data suggests that sustained job growth may not be immediate. Job growth typically occurred within three to five months after previous recessions, but in some cases, it took up to 12 months for steady job growth to begin. According to a CRS analysis, job growth after recessions typically occurred within three to five months, but in some cases, it took up to 12 months for steady job growth to begin. Congress has often directed funds to infrastructure activities to create jobs in response to recessions. Historically, public works has been synonymous with heavy and civil construction activities, including road and bridge building, flood control structures, and dam building. Today, it also includes green economic activities or so-called green jobs, which utilize renewable resources to produce energy and energy-efficient goods and services. No consistent definition of green jobs currently exists. Green jobs are those in industries utilizing renewable resources for energy production and energy-efficient goods and services. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, including models to calculate job numbers nationally and by state in the construction industry. The section discusses the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, including models to calculate job numbers nationally and by state in the construction industry. Researchers encounter difficulties in estimating the number of jobs supported by expenditures on green economic activities, caution is advised when utilizing these estimates. Policymakers are interested in knowing how many jobs are created by different economic activities during economic downturns or when shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. Interest in job creation from economic activities arises during economic downturns or budget shifts. An input-output model is often used to estimate job numbers, showing how sales value is distributed across industries. Total spending must increase for job market growth. An input-output (I-O) model is used to estimate the number of jobs created by economic activities. It shows the interrelationships between industries and how sales value is distributed. The output requirements from each industry are converted to employment requirements based on productivity estimates. The dollar value of bricks produced by the clay product and refractory manufacturing industry is used by the construction industry for residential building. Employment requirements are derived from productivity estimates for each industry, showing direct and indirect employment dependent on economic activity. Employment requirements tables are matrices showing jobs supported in various industries. An employment requirements table is a matrix showing the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars of expenditures in different industries. It helps estimate the impact of expenditures on both direct and indirect employment. An employment requirements table allows estimation of the impact of expenditures on various industries and job creation. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity at a specific time, affecting job generation potential. Estimates are often based on the number of jobs created per billion dollars spent, but the purchasing power of a billion dollars can vary between years. The impact of expenditures on job creation can vary due to technological advancements and productivity improvements over time. Estimates based on job creation per billion dollars spent may not always align with actual outcomes, especially during economic downturns or when resources are limited. Input-output models do not differentiate between imported and domestically produced goods, affecting the accuracy of job creation estimates. The impact of expenditures on job creation can vary due to technological advancements and productivity improvements over time. Estimates may fall short of actual outcomes during economic downturns or when resources are limited. Input-output models do not differentiate between imported and domestically produced goods, affecting job creation estimates. Additionally, the employment impact of expenditures may be overstated if inputs are imported, and job counts may not reflect full-time equivalents. Programs relying more on part-time workers may appear to create more jobs than those employing more full-time workers. The impact of economic activities on job creation can vary based on the type of workers employed. Estimates of job creation should consider direct, indirect, and induced jobs throughout the economy. Induced jobs depend on the spending of workers employed by the economic activity. For example, workers from a highway construction program may spend their wages in local businesses, creating additional jobs. The multiplier effect of economic activities on job creation is complex and varies based on spending patterns. Induced jobs depend on the purchases of workers in direct and indirect jobs, but estimating the multiplier is challenging due to factors like spending versus saving habits and economic conditions. Job creation studies using induced employment often use different multipliers, leading to widely varying estimates. The multiplier effect of economic activities on job creation is complex and varies based on spending patterns. Estimates of the job creation impact of federal spending on infrastructure vary widely, with different studies using different multipliers. The Federal Highway Administration's estimate from 1997, updated in 2007, indicated that $1 billion of federal-aid highway expenditures supported 47,575 jobs. A $1.25 billion expenditure on highway construction, with $1 billion from the federal government and a $250 million state match, could support 34,779 jobs according to the FHWA. The number of jobs has decreased over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs and 4,324 jobs in supporting industries per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The FHWA estimates that 27,822 jobs are supported per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. This includes 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. Induced jobs account for half of the total estimate. The job estimate utilizes the national average. The FHWA estimates that 27,822 jobs are supported per billion dollars of federal spending on highways, including construction-oriented jobs, jobs in supporting industries, and induced jobs. Induced jobs account for half of the total estimate, and the job estimate utilizes the national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs. Specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported. The employment figures have been used to justify including highway spending in an economic stimulus package, but highway funds spend out slowly, except for short-term resurfacing and preservation projects. The FHWA estimates that a significant number of workers may be needed for road resurfacing projects compared to other infrastructure projects. Highway funds spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project outlaying in the first year. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact on employment of different policies or actions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) every five years. The BLS updates the national I-O table from BEA to reflect more recent production and distribution technologies, using labor productivity data to develop an employment requirements table. The table referenced in this report reflects 2006 technologies and labor productivity, available in late 2008. The BLS utilizes updated I-O tables and labor productivity data to develop an employment requirements table for the construction industry, which includes three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. The construction industry includes three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the construction industry itself. There is a slight disparity in job figures for construction expenditures due to various factors like industry definition and data sources. The BLS employment requirements table for construction expenditures is lower than the direct and indirect jobs figure for highway expenditures from the FHWA. Discrepancies may be due to differences in industry definition, data sources, and time period. BLS data does not include other types of construction like public school construction. The survey information on construction activities is outdated. BEA estimates employment through RIMS II. The BEA utilizes surveys to estimate employment associated with various construction activities, including new schools, hospitals, roads, and maintenance. The survey information is outdated, but BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output by geographic area. Job creation estimates vary widely due to different factors. The BEA uses surveys to estimate employment in construction activities like new schools, hospitals, and roads. Job creation estimates vary widely due to different factors such as industry mix and earnings by state. Green infrastructure job estimates are more challenging than traditional infrastructure projects. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not separately identify green industries, making it challenging to estimate jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are not uniquely recognized in the current classification system. The electric utility industry is divided into different types of power generation, transmission, and distribution. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are not specifically categorized. The conventional I-O model may not accurately estimate the number of jobs supported by green activities due to the unique inputs required. Similarly, the construction industry lacks a distinct category for retrofitting, which involves a different mix of inputs compared to new construction projects. The construction industry within NAICS does not have a unique category for retrofitting, which requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction projects. This poses challenges for conventional I-O models in estimating green job creation. Researchers have addressed this issue by creating synthetic industries to account for activities like building retrofitting, as these are not specifically recognized in existing input-output tables. The Center for American Progress addresses the problem of green job estimation by creating synthetic industries to represent activities like building retrofitting. This involves combining parts of existing industries to account for sectors like wind, solar, biomass, and mass transit. Employment projections for green jobs vary based on different assumptions and timeframes. The estimation of green jobs is complex due to varying assumptions and timeframes used in studies. Some projections include direct and indirect jobs supported by shifts in energy sources, while others may not clarify induced employment. State-specific analyses may not be applicable to other regions due to different industry mixes and input availability. Some analyses on green job creation lack clarity on induced employment and may not be generalizable to other regions due to varying state economies. Job creation estimates from green economy proponents may not have been intended for quickly stabilizing or increasing jobs during a recession. The green economy strategies proposed for stimulus legislation were not specifically aimed at quickly increasing jobs in hard-hit industries. Job creation estimates from organizations promoting green economy strategies were outlined in a September 2008 report commissioned by the Center for American Progress. The report estimated almost 2 million jobs could be created through a 10-year program to build a low-carbon economy. Progress, an institute focused on research and education, is accelerating a 10-year program outlined in a 2007 report. A 2008 report by the Department of Economics and Political Economy Research Institute estimates that a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" could create or preserve nearly 2 million jobs. This program would involve federal spending on activities like building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for businesses and homeowners to encourage green initiatives. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act proposed by the Apollo Alliance in December 2008 aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a 10-year $500 billion program. It includes federal spending of about $50 billion for activities such as public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for green initiatives. Some strategies can deliver results within a year, while others may take up to two years to implement. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act proposed by the Apollo Alliance in 2008 aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a 10-year $500 billion program. It includes federal spending of about $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. Job creation figures are based on spending-to-jobs relationships estimated by other organizations, with allocations for improving the electric grid, repairing roads and bridges, and replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy options. The proposed allocation of federal funds includes $10 billion for improving the electric transmission grid (131,000 direct and indirect jobs), $8 billion for repairing roads and bridges (278,000 direct and indirect jobs), and $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with U.S.-made clean-energy vehicles (37,600 direct jobs in vehicle manufacturing and 167,000 indirect jobs). Congress emphasized timely tracking of job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The 111th Congress focused on job creation through legislation, particularly in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Title XV of the Act requires entities receiving funds to report on the number of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. Recipients had to submit this information quarterly starting in October 2009, with federal agencies posting reports online 30 days after each quarter. The Office of Management and Budget provided guidance for preparing these reports. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act required recipients of recovery funds to submit job creation reports quarterly, with federal agencies posting the information online. The Office of Management and Budget provided guidance for preparing these reports, and the Congressional Budget Office and Government Accountability Office were tasked with reviewing job estimates. Over 600,000 jobs were reported as saved or retained through September 30, 2009, leading to revisions in reporting guidelines. Based on self-reporting, 633,342 jobs were saved or retained through September 30, 2009, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Office of Management and Budget revised its guidance on job reporting in response to feedback, defining jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter. The updated guidance under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009 and another 682,370 jobs created or saved in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers is tasked with submitting quarterly reports on the effect of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The Council of Economic Advisers submits quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The first report in September 2009 estimated that ARRA may have added around one million jobs in August 2009. CBO was also tasked with assessing the job creation from direct government purchases and grants. CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 created between 600,000 and 1.6 million additional jobs. This estimate is comparable to that of the CEA, which reported 1.0-1.1 million extra jobs by August 2009. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 created between 600,000 and 1.6 million additional jobs, which aligns with the CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million extra jobs by August 2009. Additionally, the CEA's second quarterly report in January 2010 suggested that ARRA may have raised year-end employment by about 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs, while CBO estimated an increase of 1.0\u20132.1 million jobs in the fourth quarter of 2009. The stimulus law, known as ARRA, potentially increased employment by 1.7-1.9 million jobs in 2009. By the first quarter of 2010, it may have raised employment by 2.2-2.8 million jobs. In the second quarter of 2010, ARRA's impact on employment continued to be positive. The ARRA's policies potentially increased employment by 1.2\u20132.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. The CEA estimated that ARRA might have added between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2010 through public investment outlays in various sectors. Public investment outlays could have boosted total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter and over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of 2010. Public investment outlays in various sectors such as generation, efficiency, human capital, transportation infrastructure, health care, and building construction potentially increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter."
