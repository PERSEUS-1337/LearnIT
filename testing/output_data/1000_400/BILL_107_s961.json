The Act, titled the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act,\" highlights findings regarding the prevalence of breast implants among American women, the lack of a patient registry, adverse reaction reports for silicone and saline implants, and the importance of providing complete and accurate information to women. American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. FDA received adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled and saline-filled breast implants. Women need complete information about the health risks and advantages of breast implants to make informed decisions. Silicone breast implants were never FDA-approved; saline implants were approved in 2000 despite high complication rates. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication and reoperation rates. 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications after three years. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery due to local complications and device failure. In 1998, the FDA opened a criminal investigation into breast implant manufacturers manipulating research data. The investigation was not disclosed to the FDA panel considering market approval for saline implants in 2000. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates. A criminal investigation revealed that breast implant manufacturers manipulated research data. Studies showed that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants. Research sponsored by the FDA found that almost 70% of women had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. Silicone was found to be migrating away from the implants in 21% of cases. In 2000, FDA-sponsored research found that nearly 70% of women with breast implants had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migrating in 21% of cases. A 1993 study linked silicone implants to the presence of anticollagen antibodies in women. The University of California study in The Journal of Autoimmunity found a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with silicone breast implants, suggesting they are not immunologically inert. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study highlighted local complications as the primary safety concern with silicone breast implants, emphasizing the need for more research on these issues. Silicone breast implants pose safety concerns due to potential complications such as silicone migration and higher rates of certain cancers. Research is needed to better understand these risks for women considering breast implant surgery. A 1999 case report found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured silicone breast implants, leading to severe inflammation and complications. Silicone gel can elicit pathologic responses once it leaves the implant. Silicone breast implants can make mammograms less accurate as they can mask up to 40% of breast tissue. According to reports, silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms by masking up to 40% of breast tissue, leading to delayed breast cancer detection. Additionally, there are concerns about the negative impact of implants on breastfeeding, as it is uncertain if silicone may pass into breast milk and its effects on infants. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants, ensure women receive accurate information, and urge the FDA to investigate allegations against implant manufacturers. It is uncertain if silicone from implants can pass into breast milk and its impact on nursing infants. The Act aims to investigate allegations of wrong-doing by implant manufacturers that could impact the health of American women. It clarifies that existing regulations regarding silicone breast implants for reconstruction, correction of deformities, and replacement for ruptured implants remain unaffected. The Act requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. Additionally, an amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes a new section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, who will coordinate research efforts across various Institutes including the Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and National Cancer Institute. Study sections will be established by the Director of NIH. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research across various Institutes. Study sections will be established to review research grant applications and ensure high-quality research on saline and silicone breast implants. The Director of NIH conducts or supports research on saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study on women with implants for at least eight years. The study focuses on local complications such as capsular contracture, leakage, and rupture. A study is needed to differentiate between women receiving breast implants for mastectomy, reconstructive, or cosmetic purposes, focusing on local complications like capsular contracture, leakage, and rupture. The study should also evaluate atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities, comparing their health to suitable controls. The Director of NIH will annually report the results of this study to Congress. The FDA will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on the implementation status of these recommendations at regular intervals. Additionally, activities regarding silicone breast implants at the FDA will be expanded and intensified. To ensure accurate information on silicone breast implants, the FDA will expedite investigations into wrongdoing by manufacturers, update consumer information materials, and provide timely data on reported issues. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly with accurate information on local complications and ruptures. Manufacturers conducting clinical studies must ensure prospective patients are provided with FDA information. The FDA mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents with accurate information on complications and ruptures. Clinical studies must provide patients with FDA information and encourage them to obtain a Medwatch form. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to review breast implant information and advertisements annually. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel annually to review breast implant information and ads, ensuring accuracy and thoroughness for consumers. Panel includes saline and silicone breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with experience in clinical care and research."
