    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". The findings are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. This cord blood is normally discarded after childbirth but can be collected as donor tissue without risk. Cord blood, containing stem cells, is a valuable source for transplantation and research. Advantages include reduced risks to donors, quick availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications compared to bone marrow transplants. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to donors, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications. In bone marrow transplants, matched siblings are preferred donors, but only 30 percent of patients have a match. Ethnic minorities often struggle to find fully matched unrelated donors for successful transplantation. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor optimizes the chances of successful bone marrow transplantation. Ethnic minorities often struggle to find fully matched donors, leading to high complication rates with partially matched transplants. Cord blood stem cell banks increase genetic diversity in donors, providing more options for qualified candidates. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donor supply, providing fully matched and partially matched transplant units for qualified candidates. This reduces the risk of complications like graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can expedite the process of finding a suitable donor, which typically takes months to over a year from the National registry. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can expedite the process of finding a suitable donor, typically taking months to over a year from the National registry. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, with some genetic conditions being more prevalent in specific ethnic groups. Sickle Cell Anemia is more prevalent in African-American newborns, with a high risk of bacterial infections and painful crises. Patients have a median lifespan of 42 years, but severe cases rarely live beyond 20 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured 80 percent of children with the disease. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, with 80 percent of children transplanted being cured. The earlier the transplant is done in severe cases, the better the outcomes. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients. An African American patient is more likely to find a suitable unrelated cord blood donor compared to a matched bone marrow donor. With a national cord blood bank of 150,000 units, 90 percent of African American patients with conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia could find appropriately matched cord blood stem cells for treatment. The National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants since 1987, while cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation by providing matched units. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation by providing appropriately matched units to patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity. Cord blood is a source of stem cells used in transplantation, but its collection, preparation, storage, and dissemination require specific systems and expertise. Radiation exposure could cause bone marrow failure, necessitating treatment including bone marrow reconstitution. Recent scientific developments suggest that further research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases, potentially improving therapies and curing debilitating diseases. Radiation exposure could lead to bone marrow failure, requiring treatment such as bone marrow reconstitution. In cases of exposure, cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be crucial for rapid availability. Exposed individuals may also face an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma, potentially necessitating stem cell transplantation. Research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases, potentially improving therapies and curing debilitating diseases like Parkinson's disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. These diseases account for a large portion of health care expenditures in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is defined by terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, and human cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes hematopoietic stem cells and other stem cells from neonatal blood collected after birth. The Secretary contracts with qualified banks to establish and maintain the network. The Secretary contracts with qualified cord blood stem cell banks to establish a National Network containing at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells for transplant purposes. The purpose of the donor banks is to acquire, test, preserve, and store donated cord blood units in compliance with regulations, making them available for transplant centers. The cord blood stem cell bank stores donated units of human cord blood in compliance with regulations, makes them available for transplant centers, and allocates a portion for research. To be eligible as a donor bank, it must have obtained all necessary licenses and certifications. To be eligible as a donor bank, a bank must have obtained all necessary licenses, certifications, registrations, and authorizations required to operate a cord blood stem cell bank. It must also have implemented donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients from infections, established strict confidentiality to protect patient and donor identities, and comply with existing Federal and State laws. The donor bank must ensure confidentiality, encourage diverse donors, and communicate with other stem cell banks and medical facilities. The donor bank must establish systems for diverse donor encouragement, communication with other banks and medical facilities, and public education on cord blood stem cell donation benefits. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, aims to track clinical outcomes, educate the public on cord blood stem cell donation benefits, and coordinate donor banks. The Board of Directors, led by a chairperson, administers the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. Members are appointed by the Secretary for 3-year terms and include representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers and physicians from birthing hospitals. The Board of Directors, appointed by the Secretary for 3-year terms, includes representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians from birthing hospitals, the research community, transplant recipients, family members of patients, individuals with social sciences expertise, and general members. The Board of Directors, appointed by the Secretary for 3-year terms, includes representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians from birthing hospitals, the research community, transplant recipients, family members of patients, individuals with social sciences expertise, and general members. Members appointed may serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms. The Board of Directors, appointed by the Secretary for 3-year terms, includes representatives from various sectors. Members may serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, except for specific cases. The Board ensures continuity by staggering the expiration of terms. Additionally, there is a national cord blood stem cell registry. The Board of Directors is appointed for 3-year terms with approximately 1/3 of members' terms expiring each year. Members can serve until a successor is appointed. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry is established as part of the Network to identify, acquire, and distribute donated cord blood units for transplant patients. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry operates a system for identifying, acquiring, and distributing donated cord blood units matched to patients. It provides a website function for searching the registry and requesting specific units, and maintains a database to document collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry maintains a database to document the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation of cord blood units, as well as clinical outcomes. The database operates according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality, reporting periodically on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness to the Secretary. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry maintains a database to report on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of activities. The Board of Directors ensures donor banks meet requirements and collection sites comply with standards. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry ensures donor banks meet requirements and collection sites are geographically distributed throughout the US. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funding for fiscal years 2006-2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
