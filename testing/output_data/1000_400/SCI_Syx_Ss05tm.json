A new attack method reprograms the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without specifying the desired output for each input. This single perturbation can be added to all inputs to make the model perform the desired task, even if it was not trained for it. This method was demonstrated on six ImageNet classification models. Adversarial reprogramming involves adding a single perturbation to a machine learning model to make it perform a task chosen by the attacker, even if it was not trained for that task. This method was demonstrated on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing them for tasks such as counting and classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples. The study of adversarial examples highlights the potential dangers of attackers causing model prediction errors with small changes to input data. Various methods have been proposed to construct and defend against adversarial attacks that aim to cause model prediction errors with small changes to input data. These attacks can range from making a self-driving car react to a phantom stop sign with a sticker to causing an insurance company's damage model to overestimate claim values. The majority of adversarial attacks are either untargeted, degrading model performance, or targeted, producing a specific output for a given input. In this work, a novel adversarial goal is considered: reprogramming a model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without needing to compute the specific desired output. In this work, the focus is on reprogramming a model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without the need to compute the specific desired output. The adversary achieves this by learning reprogramming functions that map between the original task and the adversarial task. The adversary can reprogram a model to compute a function g(x) by learning adversarial reprogramming functions h f and h g that map between the tasks. The parameters are adjusted to achieve h g (f (h f (x))) = g (x). The functions h f and h g can be any consistent transformation that converts between the input. The concept of adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model to perform a new task by using transformation functions h f and h g to map between tasks. The attack does not necessarily need to be imperceptible to humans to be successful, and can involve theft of computational resources. Adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model for a new task using transformation functions. The attack does not need to be imperceptible to humans to succeed and can lead to theft of computational resources. Risks include theft of resources, repurposing AI assistants, and abusing machine learning services. Flexibility in neural networks allows for repurposing with minimal changes to inputs. The flexibility of neural networks allows for repurposing with minimal changes to inputs, as discussed in Section 5.2. An additive offset to a neural network's input can lead to significant changes in network behavior, showcasing the expressive power of deep neural networks. In this paper, the authors demonstrate adversarial reprogramming by crafting adversarial programs that cause neural networks to perform new tasks. They experimentally show how these programs target convolutional neural networks designed for ImageNet classification, altering their function. In Section 3, a training procedure is presented for crafting adversarial programs that reprogram neural networks to perform new tasks. Section 4 demonstrates experimental results of adversarial programs targeting convolutional neural networks for ImageNet classification, altering their function to tasks like counting squares, classifying MNIST digits, and CIFAR-10 images. The susceptibility of trained and untrained networks to adversarial reprogramming is examined, showing the possibility of reprogramming with data that has no resemblance to the original. Additionally, the concealment of adversarial programs and data is demonstrated. Sections 5 and 6 discuss and summarize these findings. Adversarial examples are inputs intentionally designed to cause machine learning models to make mistakes. These attacks can be untargeted or targeted. Adversarial reprogramming demonstrates the possibility of reprogramming tasks with data that has no resemblance to the original, as well as concealing adversarial programs and data. Adversarial attacks involve using a gradient-based optimizer to find images that cause model mistakes. These attacks can be untargeted or targeted, affecting various domains like malware detection and generative models. Reprogramming methods aim to produce specific functionality rather than a hardcoded output. Adversarial images can predict ImageNet labels for specific tasks, extending the work on reprogramming methods to produce desired functionality. Adversarial examples can be applied to multiple inputs, such as an \"adversarial patch\" that alters model predictions. Parasitic computing involves making a system solve complex tasks. Adversarial reprogramming involves using a single adversarial program to manipulate a model to process input images according to the program. It is a form of parasitic computing that forces a system to perform tasks it wasn't designed for. This can be compared to weird machines, where crafted inputs can run arbitrary code on a computer. Transfer learning and adversarial reprogramming repurpose neural networks to perform new tasks. Adversarial reprogramming manipulates models to process input images, similar to parasitic computing. Neural networks possess versatile properties useful for various tasks, such as developing features resembling Gabor filters when trained on images. Transfer learning methods use knowledge from one task as a base to perform another task with neural networks. These networks develop features resembling Gabor filters when trained on images, regardless of the dataset or training objectives. It is possible to repurpose a convolutional neural network for different tasks by training a linear SVM classifier. Transfer learning allows model parameters to be changed for new tasks, unlike adversarial reprogramming where the attacker cannot alter the model. In transfer learning, a neural network can be repurposed for different tasks by training a linear SVM classifier. Unlike transfer learning, adversarial reprogramming involves an attacker altering the model parameters to achieve their goals through manipulation of the input. This task is more challenging as it requires reprogramming across tasks with different datasets. The adversary aims to craft an adversarial program to be included in the network input to perform a new task. Adversarial reprogramming involves an adversary altering a neural network's parameters to perform a new task by crafting an adversarial program in the network input. The adversarial program is an additive contribution to the input and is not specific to a single image, but applied to all images. The adversarial program is a parameter to be learned and applied to all images, defined by a masking matrix. The mask is not required and is used for visualization purposes. The perturbation is bounded to (-1, 1) to match the ImageNet images. A sample x from the dataset is transformed into an ImageNet size image with x placed in the proper area. The adversarial perturbation is bounded to (-1, 1) to match ImageNet images. A sample x from the dataset is transformed into an ImageNet size image with x placed in the proper area. The adversarial goal is to maximize the probability that an ImageNet classifier assigns the correct label. The adversarial goal is to maximize the probability that an ImageNet classifier assigns the correct label by using a mapping function to map adversarial task labels to ImageNet labels. The optimization problem includes a weight norm penalty to reduce overfitting, optimized with Adam and exponentially decaying learning rate. Minimal computation cost is required for the adversary post-optimization. After optimization, the adversarial program has minimal computation cost as it only requires computing X adv and mapping the ImageNet label. Adversarial reprogramming exploits nonlinear behavior of the target model, unlike traditional adversarial examples. The feasibility of adversarial reprogramming was demonstrated through experiments on six ImageNet-trained architectures, reprogramming them for tasks like counting squares and classification. Resistance to reprogramming was tested through adversarial training, comparing trained networks to random ones. The study also explored reprogramming networks with adversarial data dissimilar to the original.

Adversarial training was used to test resistance to reprogramming, comparing trained networks to random ones. The study also explored reprogramming networks with dissimilar adversarial data. The study tested ImageNet-trained architectures for tasks like counting squares using adversarial reprogramming. Images with white squares were generated and embedded in an adversarial program. Each square could appear in 16 positions, with the number ranging from 1 to 10. Adversarial programs were trained per ImageNet model, with labels representing the number of squares in each image. The accuracy of the counting task was evaluated. The study demonstrated the vulnerability of neural networks to reprogramming by training adversarial programs on ImageNet models to count squares in images. Despite the dissimilarity between ImageNet labels and the new task labels, the adversarial program excelled in the counting task for all networks. This highlights how neural networks can be reprogrammed using only additive contributions to the input. Additionally, the study also showed adversarial reprogramming on the more complex task of classifying MNIST digits.

Adversarial programs trained for CIFAR-10 show visual similarities with MNIST classifiers, such as possessing low spatial frequency texture in ResNet architecture. The degree of susceptibility to adversarial reprogramming depends on specific details. The susceptibility of an Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data to adversarial reprogramming was examined. Despite being trained with adversarial examples, the model was still vulnerable to reprogramming, with only a slight reduction in attack success. The Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data, despite being trained with adversarial examples, is still vulnerable to reprogramming with only a slight reduction in attack success. Standard approaches to adversarial defense show little efficacy against adversarial reprogramming due to differences in goals, magnitude of adversarial programs, and generalization issues with defense methods. The goal of adversarial reprogramming attacks is to repurpose the network rather than cause specific mistakes. These attacks can have a large magnitude compared to traditional adversarial attacks. Adversarial defense methods may not generalize well to data from the adversarial task. Randomly initialized models struggled with the MNIST reprogramming task, showing lower accuracy compared to trained ImageNet models. The study found that using ImageNet models with randomly initialized weights resulted in lower accuracy for the MNIST classification task compared to trained models. Adversarial programs generated with random networks were qualitatively different from those obtained with pretrained networks, highlighting the importance of the original task the neural networks perform for adversarial reprogramming. This suggests that the structure of random networks may not be as easily exploited by adversarial programs.

Adversarial programs generated with random networks were qualitatively different from those obtained with pretrained networks, highlighting the importance of the original task the neural networks perform for adversarial reprogramming. Randomly initialized networks may perform poorly due to poor scaling of network weights at initialization, whereas trained weights are better conditioned. One explanation for adversarial reprogramming is that the network may rely on similarities between original and adversarial data, which was tested by randomizing pixels on MNIST digits to remove any resemblance between the two datasets. The study explored reprogramming pretrained ImageNet networks to classify shuffled MNIST and CIFAR-10 images. Despite lacking spatial structure similarities, the networks were successfully reprogrammed with comparable accuracy to standard datasets.

This suggests the possibility of reprogramming across tasks with unrelated datasets and domains. The study demonstrated the possibility of adversarial reprogramming across tasks and domains by limiting the visibility of perturbations through controlling the size and scale of the adversarial program. Using an Inception V3 model, the network was successfully reprogrammed to classify MNIST digits with lower accuracy when a small adversarial program was used. In experiments using an Inception V3 model, adversarial reprogramming was successful in classifying MNIST digits with lower accuracy using small adversarial programs. The perturbations were made nearly imperceptible by limiting the L inf norm, yet the reprogramming remained successful. Concealing the adversarial task within a normal ImageNet image was also tested by shuffling pixels of the adversarial data. Successful adversarial reprogramming was achieved with nearly imperceptible programs, even when concealing the adversarial task within a normal ImageNet image by shuffling pixels. The adversarial data structure was hidden by limiting the scale of both the program and data, and adding the resulting image to a random ImageNet image. Successful adversarial reprogramming was achieved by hiding the adversarial task within an ImageNet image using a shuffling technique. The resulting adversarial images closely resembled normal ImageNet images, successfully reprogramming the network to classify MNIST digits with lower accuracy. This demonstrates the potential for concealing adversarial tasks using more complex schemes and optimizing image choices from ImageNet.

Trained neural networks were found to be more susceptible to reprogramming than random networks, even when the data structure differed significantly. This suggests the potential for repurposing trained weights for new tasks, enabling more flexible machine learning systems. Our results show the potential for repurposing trained weights for new tasks in artificial neural networks, allowing for more flexible and efficient machine learning systems.
