    "content": "Deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires significant space. Two efficient methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, were proposed to reduce storage space while maintaining accuracy in NLP tasks. This approach achieves a significant reduction in space needed for embeddings without sacrificing accuracy. The word2ket and word2ketXS methods, inspired by quantum computing, efficiently store word embedding matrices during NLP tasks, achieving a hundred-fold reduction in storage space without compromising accuracy. Word embedding approaches like word2vec and GloVe use vectors of smaller dimensionality to represent words, allowing for efficient training on large text corpora and reducing the width of neural network layers. The embedding matrix needs to be stored in GPU memory for quick access during training and inference. The embeddings in neural networks can be trained on large text corpora to capture word relationships, with downstream layers needing width proportional to p. The d x p embedding matrix is stored in GPU memory for efficient access. Vocabulary sizes can be large, and embedding dimensionality ranges from p = 300 to p = 1024. The embedding matrix becomes a significant part of the model's parameter space. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm. In quantum computing, a qubit is fully described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector, allowing for exponential dimensionality of the state space through entanglement. In quantum computing, qubits need to be interconnected for entanglement. Entanglement is a purely quantum phenomenon where states of qubits cannot be decomposed into individual states. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits can be interconnected to represent all possible states. Approximating quantum registers classically can store vectors using less space but loses the ability to express all possible m-dimensional vectors. This loss of representation power does not significantly impact NLP machine learning algorithms using approximation approaches.

This loss does not significantly impact NLP machine learning algorithms using approximation approaches. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, efficiently store word embedding matrices during training and inference. The first method processes each word embedding independently for efficiency, while the second method processes all word embeddings jointly for even higher efficiency. Empirical evidence from NLP tasks supports the effectiveness of the new word2ket method. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rates with little impact on downstream NLP model accuracy. A tensor product space of separable Hilbert spaces V and W, denoted as V \u2297 W, is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is a Hilbert space constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The norm of v \u2297 w is equal to the product of the norms of v and w. The space is a collection of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, with vectors often referred to as tensors. An orthonormal basis in V \u2297 W can be formed using sets {\u03c8 j } and {\u03c6 k }, with coefficients indexed by pairs. In a tensor product space, vectors are often called tensors. Orthonormal basis sets {\u03c8 j } and {\u03c6 k } in V and W form a basis in V \u2297 W. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is written as |u and called a ket. In tensor product spaces, vectors are referred to as tensors. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensionalities of V and W. The tensor product can be associative, allowing for the creation of tensor product spaces with arbitrary bracketing. Dirac notation in quantum mechanics represents vectors as kets. The tensor order of a space is denoted by n, with a countable orthonormal basis. The addition and linearity properties of tensor products are discussed, highlighting challenges in expressing certain vectors in terms of components from V and W. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. Tensors with rank greater than one are called entangled. In tensor product spaces, coefficients a, b, c, d are constrained such that ac = 1/ \u221a 2 and bd = 1/ \u221a 2. Tensors of rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is unknown. A word embedding model maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information from language corpus. In a p-dimensional real Hilbert space, a function f is trained to capture semantic information from a language corpus by representing embeddings of individual words as entangled tensors. The tensor used in word2ket has a rank of r and order n, resulting in a vector v with dimension p = qn. The space complexity is O(rq log q log p), with q \u2265 4 to ensure meaningful representation. In word2ket, tensors of rank r and order n are used with v jk \u2208 R q. The resulting vector v has dimension p = q n, with space complexity of O(rq log q log p). For downstream computations involving word embedding vectors, inner products can be calculated without explicitly computing the q n-dimensional vectors. The inner product calculation between two p-dimensional word embeddings in word2ket takes O(rq log q log p) time and O(1) additional space. A small number of embedding vectors are needed for processing through subsequent neural network layers. In word2ket, inner product calculation between two p-dimensional word embeddings takes O(rq log q log p) time and O(1) additional space. For batch processing, the space requirement is O(bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing a single p-dimensional word embedding vector from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O(rn log 2 p) arithmetic operations. The tensor product space is arranged into a balanced tree for parallel processing. The tensor product space is arranged into a balanced tree for parallel processing, reducing sequential processing time to O(log 2 n). The word2ket representation involves differentiable arithmetic operations, allowing for defined gradients with respect to individual elements of vectors. The embedding vector v's gradient with respect to tunable parameters involves a sequence of O(log 2 n) linear layers with linear activation functions. The word2ket representation involves a sequence of O(log 2 n) linear layers with linear activation functions. To address potential high Lipschitz constant of the gradient, LayerNorm is used at each node in the balanced tensor product tree. Linear operators A and B map vectors from Hilbert spaces V and W into U and Y respectively, with A \u2297 B being a linear operator that maps vectors from V \u2297 W into U \u2297 Y. The curr_chunk discusses the use of LayerNorm and linear operators A and B to map vectors from Hilbert spaces V and W into U and Y respectively. It also explains how the tensor product of linear operators is bilinear and how a word embedding model can be seen as a linear operator mapping one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors. The curr_chunk explains how a word embedding model can be represented as a linear operator mapping one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors. It involves a d-token vocabulary and a d \u00d7 p word embedding matrix represented by a linear operator F. The matrix representation of F takes up O (rq log qt log t log p log d) space. The curr_chunk discusses the efficient representation of a word embedding matrix using a linear operator and tensor product-based exponential compression. Lazy tensors are used to avoid reconstructing the full matrix for multiplication in neural NLP models.

The evaluation focused on word2ketXS for NLP tasks, including German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset. The study explored different dimensionalities for the model and reported results on a separate test set using Rouge scores. In the evaluation on NLP tasks, word2ketXS was focused on for space efficiency. German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset showed a drop in BLEU score with parameter space reduction. The third task involved the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) using DrQA's model. The study focused on reducing parameter space for NLP tasks using word2ketXS. Results showed a drop in BLEU score for different space saving rates. For the SQuAD dataset, DrQA's model was used with a 3-layer bidirectional LSTM. A 0.5 point drop in F1 score was observed with significant parameter space reduction for embeddings. The study aimed to reduce parameter space for NLP tasks using word2ketXS, resulting in a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with significant space savings. The training time increased for word2ketXS-based models, with a maximum of 9 hours for tensors of order 4. The training time for 40 epochs increased from 5.8 to 7.4 hours for the word2ketXS-based model, and to 9 hours when using tensors of order 4. Despite the increase in training time, the dynamics of model training remained largely unchanged. The experiments showed significant decreases in the memory footprint of the word embedding part of the model, particularly in the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. During inference, embedding and other layers dominate the memory footprint of sequence-to-sequence models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers, which require hundreds of millions of parameters. In RoBERTa BASE, 30% of the parameters are for word embeddings. Training also requires additional memory for storing activations in all layers. During training, memory is needed to store activations in all layers for calculating gradients. This memory footprint can be reduced by optimizing word embeddings through approaches like dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, and bit encoding. Various approaches have been proposed to decrease the memory requirements for word embeddings, including dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, bit encoding, and optimized quantization methods. Techniques such as pruning, sparsity, low numerical precision, and Fourier-based approximation have also been utilized for low-memory training and inference. Word2ketXS outperforms other methods in space saving rates for parameter reduction. Bit encoding approaches are limited to a maximum space saving rate of 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other methods like parameter sharing or PCA offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have been used for document embeddings. Other methods, such as parameter sharing or PCA, offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality.
