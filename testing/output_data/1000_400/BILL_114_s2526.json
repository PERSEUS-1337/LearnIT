The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. The program defines key terms and tasks the Secretary of Commerce with its implementation. The Act establishes a program to support manufacturing communities designated under subsection (d) by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance under participating programs of agencies. The program supports manufacturing communities by giving preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance from participating agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense.
