    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. The Administration's initial request for emergency funding was made in February 2007, with an additional request for $5.3 billion for MRAP. Congress is expected to consider remaining requests for emergency supplemental appropriations in a spring 2008 bill. The Administration initially requested funding for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in February 2007. Additional requests were made in July and October 2007. Congress approved the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act in November. The Army and Marine Corps used the funds for both day-to-day activities and overseas military operations. In the fall of 2007, Congress approved the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, which provided funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. However, due to the high pace of operations in Iraq, the base budget for operation and maintenance was quickly depleted. Administration officials warned that without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. The key issue was how long they could sustain operations before receiving additional funding. The Defense Department faced a funding crisis as the Army and Marine Corps were at risk of running out of money by February and early April, respectively. To extend operations, options included transferring funds from other accounts, slowing peacetime operations, or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue, providing 37% of the requested amount for Army and Marine Corps operations and maintenance. The approval of a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for military operations temporarily resolved the funding crisis for the Defense Department. The funding provided in the consolidated FY2008 appropriations act, P.L. 110-161, along with amounts from the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, will last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance. The Defense Department has the option to extend operations by slowing obligations or transferring funds from other accounts, with up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority available. The Defense Department can extend operations beyond June by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or invoking other authorities. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies in FY2008. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department and international affairs, and $325 million for other agencies in the FY2008 budget. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act, requiring a detailed justification of funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at a similar pace to 2006, acknowledging it was a rough projection of current costs. The White House requested an additional $5.3 billion for the Department of Defense to procure Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. Later, an amendment to the FY2008 budget requested an extra $45.9 billion for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security. The White House requested an additional $5.3 billion for the Department of Defense to procure 1,520 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps. An amendment to the FY2008 budget asked for an extra $45.9 billion for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security, mainly for ongoing conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The total emergency supplemental appropriations requested for FY2008 were $195.6 billion, with a focus on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and related foreign affairs programs. The Administration requested $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008 for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and related foreign affairs programs. Congressional debate focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007 before approving a compromise bill providing funding for the Department of Defense, international affairs, and domestic programs. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, provided $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.1 billion for international affairs, and $14.5 billion for domestic programs. Congress also included a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. Funding for MRAP vehicles was quickly provided, and Congress debated measures for partial year funding for FY2008 emergency supplemental funding. Congress included a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. Funding for MRAP vehicles was quickly provided, and Congress debated measures for partial year funding for FY2008 emergency supplemental funding. In September, $5.2 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles, and in November, a conference agreement on the FY2008 defense appropriations bill was approved, providing $460 billion for the Defense Department. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, P.L. 110-116, provided $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. However, the bill did not cover extra costs for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, P.L. 110-116, allocated $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. An extra $11.6 billion was provided for MRAP vehicles. However, the bill did not include funding for additional costs related to ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. On November 14, 2007, the House approved a bill, H.R. 4156, to provide $50 billion for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The bill required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and limited the mission of remaining forces. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of legislation that aimed to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq by December 15, 2008, limit their mission to force protection and training, and extend prohibitions on torture. The measure was effectively killed by a vote of 53-45. The Senate, on November 16, 2007, rejected a motion to proceed with H.R. 4156, effectively killing the measure. They also turned down a substitute bill by Senator McConnell for $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of limited operations without additional funding. On November 15, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that without additional funding, the Army would have to cease operations at all bases by mid-February 2008, leading to furloughs of 100,000 government employees and contractors. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to the Army to extend operations until February 23, but senior officials continued to warn of halting non-essential operations without Congressional approval. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to the Army and Joint IED Defeat Organization to extend operations until February 23. Senior defense officials warned that without additional funding, the Army and Marine Corps would have to halt non-essential operations soon. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill for FY2008, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill for FY2008, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations. This included $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), excluding Iraq. Funding for Army and Marine Corps operations was restricted to OEF, with exceptions for force protection. The Senate adopted an amendment to provide $70 billion in emergency appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without restrictions on where the money could be used. The House approved the Senate amendment, clearing the bill for the President's signature. The House approved a motion to agree to the Senate amendment to provide $70 billion for overseas military operations without restrictions on usage. The President signed the consolidated appropriations bill into law on December 26, 2007, resolving a dispute over war funding that had threatened Army and Marine Corps operations. The Defense Department planned to shut down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008 due to a lack of funding. Secretary of Defense Gates warned of furloughs for civilian and contractor personnel. However, the consolidated appropriations act provided $70 billion, averting the shutdown until at least June 2008. This included $35.2 billion for the Army and $4.0 billion for the Marine Corps. The consolidated appropriations act provided $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations, averting a shutdown until at least June 2008. This funding, in addition to regular appropriations, sustains Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August 2008. The Army will exhaust its military personnel account funds by mid-June, before running out of operation and maintenance money. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend operations, including $3.7 billion in general transfer authority from the FY2008 defense appropriations act and $4.0 billion for defense emergency appropriations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army operations, including $3.7 billion from the FY2008 defense appropriations act, $3.7 billion from the Iraqi Freedom Fund, and $4.0 billion from defense emergency appropriations. Additional funds may be available in DOD working capital funds. Transfers could potentially prolong operations by up to a month, but would limit financial flexibility for other needs. Operations could also be extended using the Feed and Forage Act or other financing authority. The Defense Department has options to extend operations, such as fund transfers and invoking the Feed and Forage Act. Congress provided a temporary $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund, but the underlying controversy remains. The Defense Department may rely on regular defense appropriations to finance activities, with funds projected to be exhausted by February for the Army and early April for other services in FY2008. In FY2008, the Defense Department could extend operations by transferring funds to the Army and Marine Corps, slowing down spending, or using the Feed and Forage Act. Without supplemental appropriations, funds would be exhausted by February for the Army and early April for the Marine Corps. The proposed transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army would have extended operations for two to three weeks. Additional measures could have sustained operations for about another month. The Defense Department could have extended operations by transferring funds to the Army and Marine Corps, slowing down spending, or using the Feed and Forage Act. However, each alternative has limits and disadvantages, such as reducing financial flexibility, disrupting day-to-day operations, weakening congressional war powers, and eroding congressional controls. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, incorporated into the consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, provides regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, includes regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds totaling $1,473.8 million. This amount covers part of the Administration's $6.9 billion request, with $965 million allocated for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. Additional funds for State Department accounts in the act include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, with $575.0 million for operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection. $5.4 billion of the request still needs to be considered. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts in the consolidated appropriations act include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping, and $12.0 million for International Broadcasting. Supplemental funds for Foreign Operations accounts include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, and $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund. The State Department requested emergency funds for various programs, including Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. The House bill compared funding to the request in a summary table. The House bill allocated funds for various programs including Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, Economic Support Fund, West Bank and Gaza, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. Table 2 compares funding in the House bill to the request, and details on specific programs can be found in the \"International Affairs Emergency Supplemental Request\" section. The FY2008 defense supplemental appropriations include the Administration request, House-passed bridge fund H.R. 4156, Operation Enduring Freedom supplemental, and the final McConnell $70 billion bridge fund approved by the Senate and House. The FY2008 consolidated appropriations bill included the McConnell $70 billion bridge fund for Enduring Freedom supplemental. The original House-passed bridge fund required a plan to withdraw most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. The final $70 billion emergency funding legislation had reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. The $50 billion bridge fund approved by the House in November 2007 required the President to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq within 30 days of enactment. The original House-passed bill included a $50 billion bridge fund with a requirement for troop withdrawal from Iraq within 30 days of enactment and a target date of December 15, 2008. It allowed for a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups. H.R. 4156 stated Congress's desire for a quick and safe end to the war in Iraq and extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies. H.R. 4156 extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies and required the President to begin an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days. It set a goal of completing the transition by December 15, 2008. The President was required to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days, aiming for a limited presence by December 15, 2008. Post-transition missions included protecting U.S. facilities, training Iraqi security forces, and conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports on transition plans were mandated before considering additional funding. The President was required to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days, aiming for a limited presence by December 15, 2008. Post-transition missions included protecting U.S. facilities, training Iraqi security forces, and conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports on transition plans were mandated before considering additional funding. Required quarterly reports on transition plans for U.S. forces in Iraq, comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East, and performance measures for military and political stability in Iraq. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008, aligning with the President's outlined goals for limited military operations. The Senate failed to approve an amendment to transition the U.S. mission in Iraq to focus on counterterrorism operations, training Iraqi forces, and force protection by the end of 2008. The vote reflected ongoing Senate support and opposition to the war in Iraq. The Senate vote on the Iraq amendment in December reflected no change in support or opposition to the war. The amendment, which aimed to withdraw troops within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months, was rejected with a vote of 24-71. The approved $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for FY2008 did not include language for troop withdrawal but required a report on progress in Iraq within 60 days. The Senate refused to approve the measure for troop withdrawal from Iraq, which was then withdrawn. Instead, a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" was approved for FY2008 without language requiring troop withdrawal. The Secretary of Defense was mandated to provide a report on \"Progress Toward Stability in Iraq\" every 90 days. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations in FY2008. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations, international affairs, and other activities in FY2008, including funds for MRAP vehicle procurement and deployment. The White House requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations, international affairs, and other agencies in FY2008. This included funding for MRAP vehicle procurement and deployment, as well as emergency funding for various programs. Additional budget amendments were sent to Congress in July and October, totaling $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicles and $45.9 billion for military operations and international affairs programs. The total requested amount for FY2008 was $189.3 billion for military operations, $6.9 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. The Administration requested $189.3 billion in FY2008 for military operations, $6.9 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies as emergency spending to bypass spending caps in the congressional budget resolution. The FY2008 budget resolution exempts emergency spending from spending caps but includes a restrictive definition of emergency spending. It allows for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. The FY2008 budget resolution includes a restrictive definition of emergency spending, allowing adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. This designation permits some requested spending without exceeding budget limits in the Senate. Supplemental appropriations bills often exceed White House requests and can include significant legislative initiatives. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, P.L. 110-28, included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, and the SCHIP children's health insurance program, along with a measure to raise the minimum wage. The appropriations committee was expected to add more \"emergency\" funds for Hurricane Katrina recovery and other purposes in the FY2008 supplemental bill for the war. However, due to delays, funding for non-defense programs was provided in the second FY2008 continuing resolution instead. The second FY2008 continuing resolution, attached to the defense appropriations bill, provided funding for various non-defense programs including veterans health, community development for Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. The FY2008 continuing resolution included additional funds for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. Congress allocated $16.8 billion for MRAPs in previous bills, with $5.2 billion for production and deployment in the first resolution and $11.6 billion in the defense appropriations bill. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, includes $11.6 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps, almost meeting the requested amount. The omnibus appropriations bill also allocates funds for various military operations and maintenance, training Afghan and Iraqi security forces, joint IED defense, and weapons procurement. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, includes $1.35 billion for Afghan security forces, $1.5 billion for Iraqi forces, $3.7 billion for the Iraqi Freedom Fund, $4.3 billion for joint IED defense, $6.1 billion for weapons procurement, and permits up to $4 billion to be transferred between accounts in the bridge fund. This funding trend continues to provide increasing amounts of money to the Defense Department through supplemental appropriations. The trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for military operations in FY2008 continues, with funding growing significantly since FY2003. The rise in funding is not solely due to the pace of military operations but also reflects investments in repair and other areas. The increase in funding for military operations in FY2008 is not solely due to the pace of operations but also to investments in repairing and upgrading equipment. The largest funding increases have been for weapons procurement, operation and maintenance, and training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi military forces. Supplementals have also been used for reorganizing the Army. The Defense Department's funding has significantly increased, with a focus on weapons procurement, operation and maintenance, and training Afghan and Iraqi military forces. There have also been investments in repairing and upgrading equipment, as well as reorganizing the Army. The Defense Department has seen large increases in funding for force protection and reconstitution, with a focus on repairing and replacing equipment lost in combat. Secretary Rumsfeld preferred to use the term \"reset\" to describe the process of returning the force to its needed condition. The term \"reconstitution\" has been used to repair and replace equipment lost in combat to restore the force. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" to return the force to its needed condition, not necessarily its prewar state. The Defense Department now uses \"reconstitution\" to encompass more than just restoring the force. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass more than just restoring the force. It now includes substantial upgrades to the force, especially for the Army and Marine Corps, such as fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping deploying units with the same equipment used in the theater for better training. Guard and reserve units are also being more fully equipped with newer equipment. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass substantial upgrades to the force, especially for the Army and Marine Corps. This includes fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment in combat units, and fully equipping deploying units with the same equipment used in the theater for better training. Guard and reserve units are also being more fully equipped with newer equipment. Congress has generally supported steps to upgrade ground forces, with questions raised about specific equipment funding increases. Congress has generally supported steps to upgrade ground forces, with questions raised about specific equipment funding increases. In action on the FY2007 war supplemental, there were questions about the rationale for certain aircraft requests, which were later withdrawn by the Administration in a budget amendment realigning funding to reflect costs of the troop surge. Funding for MRAPs is the largest single item in the amended defense request, with Congress providing most of the requested money. The October 22 budget amendment realigned funding to cover costs of the troop surge, including $6.3 billion for maintaining additional Army and Marine units in Iraq. Other increases in the amendment included $1 billion for Iraqi security forces and $100 million for factory reopening in Iraq. The October 22 budget amendment included additional funds for Iraqi security forces, factory reopening in Iraq, Commanders Emergency Response Program for Afghanistan, and construction of facilities and roads in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also allocated $8.8 billion for equipment repair and replenishment, including $1 billion for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment.

The Bush Administration has been criticized for relying too heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. Some budget experts criticize the Administration for relying on supplementals, particularly for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration argues that emergency requests are necessary for unforeseen expenses. In February 2007, the FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq and $53 million for Contributions to International Organizations. This was later amended to add nearly $1.3 billion for various programs.

Until the passage of the omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill, nearly $42 billion in U.S. funds had been allocated. The omnibus bill included $100 million for Foreign Military Financing and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations in FY2008. Almost $42 billion had been allocated for Iraq reconstruction until then. The Administration did not request security assistance in its regular Defense budget proposal for FY2008, but asked for $392 million under State and Foreign Operations appropriations. Congress rejected the Administration's request for Iraq funding in FY2008. In FY2008, Congress rejected the Administration's request for Iraq funding in the State and Foreign Operations appropriations. The Administration then requested $4.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for Department of Defense reconstruction appropriations. The request for Department of Defense (DOD) reconstruction appropriations for Iraq totaled about $3.7 billion. It would mainly fund training and equipping Iraqi troops through the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF) and reconstruction grants provided under the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). CERP allows military commanders to support various local economic activities with small grants, including infrastructure projects like repairing electric generators and constructing sewer systems. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) provides small grants for local projects like renovating health clinics, digging wells, and painting schools. It also funds infrastructure efforts such as repairing electric generators and constructing sewer systems. Recently, CERP has paid salaries to the Sons of Iraq to improve security. Additionally, a $100 million request was added to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq, aiming to stimulate the economy and create employment by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. The budget revision added a $100 million request to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund account for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq. The Task Force aims to stimulate the economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. News reports have highlighted difficulties with the program due to lack of electricity, insecure environment, and lack of enthusiasm from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would direct $1.2 billion toward Iraq under the State and Foreign Operations appropriations budget. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would allocate $1.2 billion to Iraq under the State and Foreign Operations appropriations budget. This includes funding for Economic Support, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Migration and Refugee Assistance, and International Disaster and Famine Assistance accounts. The assistance provided by Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) is primarily funded by ESF, with 31 teams in total, including embedded PRTs supporting local economic projects in stabilized areas. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) have grown to 31, including 13 newly established embedded PRTs concentrated in Baghdad and Anbar province. They support local economic projects in stabilized areas using ESF-funded grants, job training, and micro-loan programs. PRTs also help increase the capacities of local government officials to spend Iraqi-owned capital funds for infrastructure programs. ESF at the national level supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts. An additional $25 million was added to the ESF supplemental request in October. The Iraqi government allocated funds for infrastructure programs, with ESF supporting Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts. An additional $25 million was added to the ESF supplemental request in October, proposing the establishment of a new Iraq enterprise fund modeled after those in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
