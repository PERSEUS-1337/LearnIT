Recent works have explored probabilistic models, but they are computationally expensive or do not optimize data likelihood directly. This work introduces multi-frame video prediction using normalizing flows, enabling direct data likelihood optimization and high-quality stochastic predictions.

This work proposes multi-frame video prediction using normalizing flows, allowing for direct optimization of data likelihood and generating high-quality stochastic predictions. It demonstrates the effectiveness of flow-based generative models in video prediction, showcasing exponential progress in machine learning capabilities. Machine learning technology has made significant progress in various capabilities like image classification, machine translation, and game-playing agents. However, its application has been limited to situations with large supervision or accurate simulations. An alternative approach is to use large unlabeled datasets with predictive generative models to predict future events effectively. Utilizing large unlabeled datasets with predictive generative models can help build complex models that understand the physical world without labeled examples. By training on video sequences, these models can learn about a wide range of real-world phenomena, making them useful for downstream tasks. Videos of real-world interactions are abundant and can be used to train a large generative model on unlabeled datasets to learn about various real-world phenomena. This model can be beneficial for creating representations for downstream tasks or for applications like robotics where predicting the future is crucial. The challenge in video prediction lies in the uncertainty of the future, with multiple possible outcomes from a short present observation sequence. Previous works have explored probabilistic models for uncertain futures, but they are either computationally expensive or do not directly optimize data likelihood. This paper delves into this issue. In this paper, the focus is on stochastic prediction, particularly in conditional video prediction. The goal is to create video prediction models that can generate diverse stochastic futures, provide exact likelihoods, and synthesize realistic video frames. The approach extends flow-based generative models to achieve these objectives. The proposed video prediction models aim to generate diverse stochastic futures, provide exact likelihoods, and synthesize realistic video frames by extending flow-based generative models into conditional video prediction. This approach addresses the challenges of modeling high-dimensional video sequences by learning a latent dynamical system model that predicts future values of the flow model's latent state. VideoFlow is a flow-based video prediction model that learns a latent dynamical system to predict future values of the latent state, inducing Markovian dynamics. It achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction on the BAIR dataset, with quantitative and qualitative performance comparable to VAE-based models. VideoFlow, a flow-based video prediction model, achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction on the BAIR dataset. It produces high-quality results without common artifacts like blurry predictions, making it practical for real-time applications such as robotic control. VideoFlow optimizes the likelihood of training videos directly, allowing for evaluation based on likelihood values. VideoFlow achieves faster real-time image synthesis for applications like robotic control by optimizing training video likelihood directly. Previous work focused on deterministic predictive models with architectural changes and different generation objectives. The focus shifts to addressing stochastic environments in video modeling, where real-world videos are inherently random or influenced by unobserved factors like off-screen events, unknown intentions of humans and animals, and objects with unknown properties. The challenge now is to build models that can effectively reason over uncertain futures. In stochastic environments, models need to reason over uncertain futures in real-world videos affected by random events or unobserved factors. Deterministic models struggle to generate multiple futures, leading to blurry predictions. To address this, methods like variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive models have been used to incorporate stochasticity. Various methods have been developed to incorporate stochasticity in video prediction models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive models. Among these, variational autoencoders have been widely explored for optimizing log-likelihood. Auto-regressive models are the only class that directly maximizes log-likelihood by generating videos pixel by pixel. The prior class of video prediction models, such as auto-regressive models, generate videos pixel by pixel but are inefficient on modern hardware. Attempts to speed up training and synthesis with these models have resulted in sharp but noisy predictions. In contrast, a proposed VAE model produces better long-term predictions by optimizing log-likelihood directly and exhibiting faster sampling. The VAE model produces better long-term predictions compared to auto-regressive models, optimizing log-likelihood directly and exhibiting faster sampling. Flow-based generative models offer advantages such as exact latent-variable inference, log-likelihood evaluation, and parallel sampling. Flow-based generative models (Dinh et al., 2014) encode data into stochastic variables through a sequential process, allowing for exact latent-variable inference and log-likelihood evaluation. By transforming data through invertible functions, we can compute the log-likelihood exactly and generate samples from the data distribution. In flow-based generative models, data is encoded into stochastic variables through invertible functions, allowing for exact log-likelihood evaluation and sample generation. Parameters are learned by maximizing log-likelihood over a training set, and a generative flow for video is proposed using a multi-scale architecture. The text discusses the use of latent variables in a multi-scale architecture for video generation using invertible transformations. The architecture encodes information about frames at different scales and employs simple-to-compute Jacobian determinants for invertible transformations. In this subsection, invertible transformations with simple-to-compute Jacobian determinants are explored, including triangular, diagonal, and permutation matrices. Various techniques such as Actnorm, Coupling, SoftPermute, and Squeeze are applied to process the input data for video generation. In this subsection, invertible transformations with simple-to-compute Jacobian determinants are explored for video generation. Coupling splits the input y equally across channels to compute z2 using deep networks. SoftPermute applies a 1x1 convolution, and Squeeze reshapes the input for a larger receptive field. The multi-scale architecture f\u03b8(xt) is composed of flows at multiple levels to obtain the final output. The multi-scale architecture f\u03b8(xt) uses flows at multiple levels to operate on lower dimensions and larger scales. Latent variables are inferred for each frame of the video using an autoregressive factorization for the latent prior. The latent prior in Equation (1) is defined using an autoregressive factorization, with conditional priors specified for each timestep. The architecture includes a factorized Gaussian density and a deep 3-D residual network for prediction. The log-likelihood objective of Equation (1) consists of two parts, detailed in Sections B and C of the appendix. The architecture described includes a deep 3-D residual network augmented with dilations and gated activation units to predict the mean and log-scale of a Gaussian density. The log-likelihood objective has two parts: the invertible multi-scale architecture and the latent dynamics model. The parameters are jointly learned by maximizing this objective, with the prior modeling temporal dependencies and the flow acting on separate video frames. Equation (5) involves jointly learning parameters of the multi-scale architecture and latent dynamics model by maximizing the objective. The architecture prioritizes modeling temporal dependencies with the prior, while the flow operates on individual video frames. Experimental comparisons show realism of generated trajectories with different models. VideoFlow model is conditioned on frame t=1 to generate trajectories at t=2 and t=3 for various shapes. 3-D convolutional flows were considered but deemed computationally expensive compared to an autoregressive prior. Using 2-D convolutions in our flow f \u03b8 with autoregressive priors allows for synthesizing long sequences without temporal artifacts. 3-D convolutional flows were found to be computationally expensive compared to autoregressive priors. The generated videos can be viewed on a website, with a blue border representing the conditioning frame. VideoFlow utilizes 2-D convolutions in the flow f \u03b8 with autoregressive priors to synthesize long sequences without temporal artifacts. The generated videos display a blue border for the conditioning frame and a red border for the generated frames. The Stochastic Movement Dataset is modeled using VideoFlow, where a shape moves in one of eight directions with constant speed. VideoFlow uses deterministic models to predict the future trajectory of a shape moving in one of eight directions with constant speed. By looking back at just one frame, the model achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 on the holdout set. The generated videos consistently predict the shape's movement to be one of the eight random directions. VideoFlow outperforms state-of-the-art models SV2P and SAVP-VAE in stochastic video generation. It consistently generates plausible \"real\" trajectories at a greater rate, as shown in a real vs fake Amazon Mechanical Turk test. The model achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 on the holdout set by looking back at just one frame. VideoFlow outperforms baselines in generating plausible \"real\" trajectories in a real vs fake Amazon Mechanical Turk test using the BAIR robot pushing dataset. The task of video generation is unsupervised with multiple plausible trajectories due to partial observability and stochasticity. VideoFlow is trained to maximize log-likelihood, achieving a low bits-per-pixel rate. VideoFlow is trained to generate 10 target frames based on 3 input frames, achieving a low bits-per-pixel rate. Realism and diversity are measured using a 2AFC test and mean pairwise cosine distance in VGG perceptual space. The models have seen a total of 13 frames during training, with VideoFlow outperforming baselines in generating plausible trajectories. The mean pairwise cosine distance between generated samples in VGG perceptual space is calculated. VideoFlow outperforms other models on bits-per-pixel, attributing the baselines' high values to their optimization objective. The variational bound of bits-per-pixel is estimated on the test set, with VideoFlow generating the most realistic and diverse trajectories. The study evaluates stochastic video generation models on the BAIR action-free dataset, selecting the best video based on PSNR, SSIM, and VGG metrics. Despite the high variability in the dataset, the models aim to generate realistic videos representing plausible futures. The evaluation metrics used are based on prior work by Lee et al. (2018) and Denton & Fergus (2018). The BAIR robot-pushing dataset is evaluated using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and VGG to select the best video from stochastic models. 100 videos are generated for each set of conditioning frames, and the closest to the ground truth is determined. This helps understand if the true future is within the set of plausible futures. In prior work, researchers effectively tune pixel-level variance as a hyperparameter to improve sample quality in video models. By removing pixel-level noise, higher quality videos can be achieved at the cost of diversity. Sampling videos at a lower temperature can help remove pixel-level noise, similar to a procedure in previous studies. In prior work, researchers have improved sample quality in video models by tuning pixel-level variance as a hyperparameter. This can be achieved by sampling videos at a lower temperature, which removes pixel-level noise. The procedure involves scaling the standard deviation of the latent gaussian distribution by a factor of T. Results are reported with both a temperature of 1.0 and an optimal temperature tuned on the validation set using VGG similarity metrics. Low-temperature sampling applied to latent gaussian priors of SV2P and SAVP-VAE was found to negatively impact performance. Our model with optimal temperature performs better or as well as the SAVP-VAE and SVG-LP models on VGG-based similarity metrics, correlating well with human perception and SSIM. The model with temperature T = 1.0 is also competitive with state-of-the-art video generation models on these metrics. Our model with temperature T = 1.0 outperforms SAVP-VAE and SVG-LP models on VGG-based similarity metrics and competes well with state-of-the-art video generation models. PSNR is a pixel-level metric, while VideoFlow models the conditional probability of frame distributions, leading to lower performance on PSNR. Diversity and quality of generated samples are assessed by computing mean distances in VGG perceptual space and conducting real vs fake tests. VideoFlow outperforms diversity values reported in prior work while being competitive in realism. At T = 0.6, VideoFlow has the highest fooling rate and is on par with state-of-the-art VAE models in diversity. Lower temperatures result in less random arm behavior and static background objects, leading to higher realism scores. Higher temperatures produce more stochastic arm motion and diverse background objects. On inspection of the generated videos, lower temperatures result in less random arm behavior and clear static background objects, achieving higher realism scores. Higher temperatures lead to more stochastic arm motion and noisy background objects, decreasing realism. Interpolations between different shapes and frames in the BAIR robot pushing dataset show temporally cohesive arm motion. Interpolations between the first input frame and the last target frame of two test videos in the BAIR robot pushing dataset show cohesive arm motion and smooth size interpolation of shapes in the latent space. The bottom level interpolates the motion of background objects at a smaller scale, while the top level interpolates arm motion. Two shapes with fixed type but different size and color are encoded into the latent space, with smooth size interpolation observed. Colors are sampled from a uniform distribution during training, and all interpolated colors are from the training set. VideoFlow is used to detect plausibility of temporally inconsistent frames in the future. VideoFlow is utilized to detect the plausibility of temporally inconsistent frames in the future. Generated videos show maintained temporal consistency even 100 frames ahead, with occlusions causing background objects to become noisier and blurrier. The model has a bijection between latent state z t and frame x t, meaning it can forget occluded objects after a few frames. Our VideoFlow model has a bijection between the latent state z t and frame x t, causing occluded objects to be forgotten after a few frames. Future work includes incorporating longer memory in the model and using more memory-efficient algorithms for invertible neural networks. The model is conditioned on 3 frames to detect the plausibility of a temporally inconsistent frame in the immediate future. The VideoFlow model uses backpropagation algorithms for invertible neural networks to detect the likelihood of a temporally inconsistent frame occurring in the future. It conditions on 3 frames to predict the 4th frame and shows a decreasing log-likelihood for frames further in the future. The architecture is inspired by the Glow model for image generation. The VideoFlow model, inspired by the Glow model, predicts future frames with decreasing log-likelihood for frames further in the future. It achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction and optimizes log-likelihood directly for faster synthesis, making it practical for various applications.

Future work includes incorporating memory for long-range dependencies and applying the model to challenging tasks. The dataset consists of 8-bit videos with added uniform noise for scaling and discretization. The data consists of 8-bit videos with added uniform noise for scaling and discretization. Additive noise is necessary to prevent infinite densities at datapoints, improving optimization of log-likelihood.

Comparisons were made between P(X4 = Xt|X<4) and VGG cosine similarity for different time steps. Correlation between cosine similarity and bits-per-pixel was analyzed using a pretrained VGG network and the trained VideoFlow model. The study compared P(X4 = Xt|X<4) and VGG cosine similarity between X4 and Xt for t = 4 to 13. Results showed a weak correlation between VGG perceptual metrics and bits-per-pixel. A smaller version of the VideoFlow model with 4x parameter reduction remained competitive with SVG-LP on VGG perceptual metrics."
