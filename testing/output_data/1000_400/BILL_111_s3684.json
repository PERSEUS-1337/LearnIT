    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". Congress finds that cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations or CCM, affects approximately 1,500,000 individuals in the United States. This blood vessel disease is characterized by vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to serious clinical symptoms such as neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death. Detection of these lesions requires costly medical imaging techniques, and limited research exists on cavernous angioma. Individuals with cavernous angioma may not be aware of the disease until serious symptoms appear, such as neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death. Treatment options are limited to brain and spinal surgery, but some individuals may not be eligible for surgery. There is a shortage of physicians familiar with cavernous angioma, making timely diagnosis and appropriate care challenging. The presence of a specific disease-causing mutation, known as the \"common Hispanic mutation,\" contributes to the disease. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, expresses the sense of the situation. The prevalence of cavernous angioma is high in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, emphasizes the need for increased research and awareness about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports research at higher education institutes to better understand biomedical systems. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence at higher education institutes. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma and enhance medical care nationwide. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico to provide a model medical system, facilitate research for a cure, and enhance medical care nationwide. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Cavernous Angioma Care Center of Excellence. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide support for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will consist of researchers, clinicians, and medical staff, including a medical director specializing in cavernous angioma research and clinical care. The CARE Center established at the University of New Mexico will consist of cavernous angioma researchers, clinicians, and medical staff including a medical director, headache or pain specialist, epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, and clinical nurse. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will include a nurse practitioner specializing in neurology or neurosurgery, a nurse coordinator for patient advocacy and research, a research coordinator, a clinical nurse for in-patient management, a radiology specialist, a clinical vascular fellow, a basic science postdoctoral fellow, and a genetic counselor. The center must be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school providing education and training in neurological diseases, including cavernous angioma diagnosis and treatment. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico includes a genetic counselor and must be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school providing education and training in neurological diseases, including cavernous angioma diagnosis and treatment. The center also maintains programs for postdoctoral research training, recruitment of new researchers and clinicians, continuing medical education for clinicians in cavernous angioma care, and patient advocacy and education programs. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico focuses on cavernous angioma care and research. It includes programs for continuing medical education, patient advocacy, outreach, and education. This involves launching awareness campaigns, creating patient education materials, educating school nurses for early detection, and organizing educational conferences for patients and families. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico focuses on cavernous angioma care and research. It includes programs for continuing medical education, patient advocacy, outreach, and education.

The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico focuses on cavernous angioma care and research. It aims to facilitate translational projects, establish an advisory board, and collaborate with other institutions for information sharing and coordination of research activities. The center also plans to have a Director composed of individuals with expertise in cavernous angioma and relevant biomedical disciplines. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico, focused on cavernous angioma care and research, is to be headed by a Director with expertise in patient care and research. The Director's duties include ensuring community-centered care and promoting understanding and treatment of cavernous angioma. The center will have an advisory board with diverse expertise and representation from relevant institutions. The Director of the CARE Center at the University of New Mexico is responsible for providing high-quality care for individuals with cavernous angioma. This includes ensuring community-centered care, promoting participation in research studies, and developing the center as a model for other facilities in the United States. Reporting on the center's activities is required within 2 years. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico aims to serve individuals with cavernous angioma, develop as a model facility, and provide training for similar centers in the US. Reporting on the center's progress and expenditures is required biannually. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico must report biannually to the Secretary on its progress, expenditures, and activities. $2,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2011 to establish and operate the Care Center."
