    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Previous court cases have established the need for a connection between a state and the transaction being taxed. In two separate cases, preliminary injunctions were granted against the PACT Act. In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, federal district courts granted preliminary injunctions against the PACT Act, stating that requiring remote retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts violates due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the injunction in Red Earth, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider the injunction in Gordon. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction in Red Earth against the PACT Act, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider a similar injunction in Gordon. The federal district court in Musser's Inc. v. United States rejected a due process argument, stating that the PACT Act is just a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts through its interactive website. The PACT Act was challenged in court for potentially violating due process. The court ruled that the Act is similar to other federal statutes incorporating state law. It was noted that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with jurisdictions where it shipped tobacco products through its website. The constitutionality of the PACT Act for remote retailers hinges on the definition of minimum contacts. Congress may not have the power to require remote retailers to pay taxes in jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act for remote retailers depends on the definition of minimum contacts. Congress may not be able to require remote retailers to pay taxes in jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The Supreme Court has stated that minimum contacts depend on the retailer's activities in the state and that the tax paid must be rationally related to the state's values. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to align with brick and mortar retailers, increase tax collection, deter smuggling, and limit youth access. It deems interstate sales as intrastate to boost tax revenue. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by deeming interstate sales as intrastate, requiring compliance with state and local laws, including excise taxes and restrictions on sales to minors. The PACT Act regulates remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by enforcing state and local laws, including excise taxes, sales restrictions, and tax obligations. State taxation of out-of-state businesses must comply with the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause. The PACT Act regulates remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, enforcing state and local laws, including excise taxes and sales restrictions. State taxation of out-of-state businesses must comply with the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause, which prohibit undue burdens on interstate commerce and require a sufficient connection to the state for tax imposition. The Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause are \"analytically distinct,\" with the Supreme Court's Quill decision guiding due process issues for remote retailers challenging the PACT Act. The remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, which requires a physical presence in the state to satisfy minimum contacts for state taxation. The Supreme Court's Quill decision guides due process issues for out-of-state businesses. The Court upheld state taxation of out-of-state businesses by comparing it to jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants, citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. Physical presence in a state is not necessary for jurisdiction due to modern commercial practices involving mail and wire communications across state lines. In modern commercial practices, physical presence in a state is not essential for jurisdiction, as business is often conducted solely through mail and wire communications across state lines. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that purposefully directing activities towards residents of another state establishes minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction, as seen in the Quill case where a retailer's catalogues sent to North Dakota residents satisfied this requirement. In Quill, the Supreme Court ruled that directing activities towards residents of another state establishes minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction, as evidenced by a retailer sending catalogues to North Dakota residents. The issue under Quill is whether the out-of-state business has purposefully directed its activities at the taxing state, providing fair warning of tax liability. Members of the Seneca Nation of Indians who own and operate tobacco retail businesses sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements. They argued that the Act violates the Due Process Clause by subjecting them to taxing jurisdictions without sufficient minimum contacts. The court rejected the argument that maintaining a website alone establishes minimum contacts. The plaintiffs argued that the PACT Act did not violate due process because they maintained websites and shipped goods into taxing jurisdictions. However, the court found that not all plaintiffs had websites and that the websites were passive, serving as virtual catalogs without the ability to complete purchases online. The court determined that a passive website selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco did not meet the minimum contacts requirement for taxation. The court also rejected the argument that a shipment into a state satisfied this requirement. The court rejected the argument that a single sale creates minimum contacts for taxation, citing that existing cases suggest otherwise. The court emphasized that a single, isolated sale may not be sufficient to subject a seller to a foreign jurisdiction. The court found that a single sale may not create enough minimum contacts for taxation, as previous cases have shown conflicting outcomes on this issue. The court highlighted that the Supreme Court in Quill focused on continuous solicitation of business rather than a single sale when determining jurisdiction. The court criticized the PACT Act for potentially disregarding due process requirements and expanding jurisdictional reach without constraints. The PACT Act seeks to expand jurisdictional reach without regard to due process constraints, which was challenged in court. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction, questioning if Congress can require vendors to submit to taxing jurisdiction of any state based on a single sale. The Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction regarding the PACT Act, questioning if Congress can require vendors to collect taxes based on a single sale without due process constraints. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. In Musser's case, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction on the ground that the PACT Act requires retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions, in violation of Due Process. The plaintiff, a tobacco retailer operating nationwide, sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act, claiming it violated Due Process by requiring tax payments without minimum contacts. The district court denied the injunction, stating that Congress, not states, imposed the tax-payment requirement. The PACT Act's tax-payment requirement is imposed by Congress, not states, in regulating interstate commerce. Interstate businesses must comply with state and local laws as a condition of engaging in interstate commerce, which has been found not to offend due process. Interstate businesses must comply with state and local laws as a condition of engaging in interstate commerce. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states because of the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach to determine personal jurisdiction based on online activities. The court uses a sliding scale approach to determine personal jurisdiction based on online activities. Interactive websites where users can exchange information with the host computer may establish minimum contacts in all 50 states. In Musser's case, the plaintiff's website allowed customers to place orders, pay for products, and have them delivered to different states. The court in Musser's case found that conducting business through an interactive website can establish minimum contacts in all 50 states. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, also sought jurisdiction based on his passive website that directs viewers to call his store to place orders. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, deeming it timely. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, deeming it timely. The Court observed that Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects should be treated separately, even if Congress authorizes state levies based on minimum contacts. The Supreme Court distinguishes between Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of Gordon's claims. National legislation can sanction burdens on interstate commerce but must adhere to principles of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" The question remains whether disparate state levies on e-commerce make concerns about presence and burden obsolete. The government argues that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, and each tobacco sale satisfies minimum contacts with a state. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, and each tobacco sale satisfies minimum contacts with a state. The PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers, unlike previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to the jurisdiction of any particular states. The court distinguished previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to state jurisdiction, stating that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument that Congress can authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's and concluded that while Congress can authorize state actions that burden interstate commerce, it cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court reviewed the seminal due process cases and rejected the government's argument that each of Gordon's sales establishes minimum contacts. The court reviewed key due process cases like International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to determine if Gordon's sales establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. The court emphasized that jurisdiction is proper when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum State. The court emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established when a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State, as stated in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The Supreme Court noted that a defendant's deliberate engagement in significant activities within a State or creation of continuing obligations with residents of the forum State constitutes availing oneself of conducting business there, justifying the requirement to submit to litigation in that forum. The district court emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established when a commercial actor purposefully directs efforts towards residents of another State, as noted in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The Supreme Court highlighted that a defendant's deliberate engagement in significant activities within a State justifies the requirement to submit to litigation in that forum, based on the foreseeability of being haled into court there. The court emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established when a commercial actor purposefully directs efforts towards residents of another State, as noted in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. In World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Supreme Court elaborated on the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, stating that defendants should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in a forum state. The focus on foreseeability provides predictability to the legal system, allowing potential defendants to structure their conduct with assurance. Additionally, the district court discussed Quill and the requirement of a definite link between a state and the person, property, or transaction it seeks to tax for due process purposes. The district court discussed Quill's due process challenge, emphasizing the need for a definite link between a state and the entity being taxed. In Quill, the Supreme Court found that the mail order business had sufficient contacts with North Dakota to meet due process requirements. However, the court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon's case. The district court found that Quill purposefully directed its activities at North Dakota residents, with sufficient contacts for due process, and the use tax is related to the benefits Quill receives. In Gordon's case, the court did not find that his business purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the economic market in other states or directed activities at residents. The district court also did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing State. The district court found that the PACT Act may violate due process as there is no rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing State. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process by allowing state taxation of out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts, potentially not satisfying the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act may not comply with the Due Process Clause if it subjects out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the Act under the Due Process Clause has been analyzed in court cases like Red Earth and Gordon. It is uncertain if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the minimum contacts requirement for due process. The PACT Act's compliance with the Due Process Clause is uncertain as it may subject out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. Higher courts may find it unclear if a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies the due process requirement of minimum contacts."
