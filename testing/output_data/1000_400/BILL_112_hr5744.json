It provides efficiency tools to streamline projects and includes provisions for public review and environmental analysis. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and protect endangered species. It provides efficiency tools to streamline projects and includes provisions for public review and environmental analysis. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" as areas with high wildfire risk on Federal lands. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" refers to measures developed by the Secretary concerned for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed restoration, or protection of threatened and endangered species habitat in at-risk forests or on threatened and endangered species habitat. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" includes methods developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed restoration, and protection of threatened and endangered species habitat on Federal land. This may involve activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest projects. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" encompasses activities for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and habitat preservation on Federal land. It excludes land where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law, except for inventoried roadless areas or wilderness study areas. The \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land. The term \"threatened and endangered species habitat\" on Federal land is crucial for species protection, identified in recovery plans under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. Wildfire is a threat to endangered or threatened species and their habitats as identified in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects must be implemented in at-risk forests and on threatened and endangered species habitat, focusing on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects on endangered species habitat aim to enhance protection from wildfires and comply with relevant guidelines. Authorized wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests aim to improve land conditions and reduce fuel loads. Grazing may be used to achieve these goals without adherence to utilization standards. In authorized wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests, grazing and timber harvesting can be used to reduce fuel loads and prevent catastrophic wildfires without the need to revise land management plans. The section discusses the prevention of wildfires in at-risk forests through measures like managing ladder and canopy fuel loads. It also states that conducting wildfire prevention projects does not require revisions to land management plans. Additionally, it mentions the consideration of public petitions for designating federal land as at-risk forest or endangered species habitat. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. Public Notice and Comment for Proposed Wildfire Prevention Projects: The Secretary concerned must publish a notice in the Federal Register for a proposed project, allowing the public to submit written comments within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering received comments, with only those who commented on the proposed project being able to submit further feedback. The Secretary must designate the final wildfire prevention project after considering comments received and publish a notice in the Federal Register. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit further feedback within 30 days. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws and conduct an authorized wildfire prevention project. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, for authorized wildfire prevention projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. An environmental assessment must be prepared within 30 days of publishing notice for such projects. If an authorized wildfire prevention project involves timber harvesting or grazing, the Secretary must prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days of publishing notice. Failure to meet this deadline deems the project compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act. The wildfire prevention project will be considered compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act if the Secretary fails to meet the deadline for preparing an environmental assessment. For livestock grazing projects, the assessment is valid for 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for 20 years. The Secretary is not required to consider alternatives to the proposed action in the assessment. Compliance with this section fulfills the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Compliance with this section satisfies requirements of various environmental acts, and the Secretary is not obligated to study alternatives to proposed agency actions. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\nAdministrative review of wildfire prevention projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted according to the Act as well.\n\nSEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS.\n\nBefore listing species under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary must assess the impact on forest fuel loads and include wildfire risk analysis in recovery plans and habitat determinations."
