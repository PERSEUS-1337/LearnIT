    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Many leukemia patients requiring bone marrow transplants do not have a suitable match, but there is a chance that a newborn baby's cord blood cells could be a perfect match for a sibling with a blood disease. Cord blood cells have been effectively used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, providing a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children. They result in a lower rate of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow and are easier to match based on HLA typing. Cord blood cells have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, providing a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children. They have a lower rate of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow and are easier to match based on HLA typing. Cord blood cells have also been effective in treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells and are pluripotent, able to differentiate into different cell types. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells, including pluripotent cells that can differentiate into every cell type in the human body. These cells have shown potential in decreasing inflammation, stimulating tissue repair, and are being studied for treating conditions like type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended establishing a National Hematopoietic Stem Cell Bank Program to provide clear information to donors about their options for cord blood banking. Over 90 percent of cord blood cells from more than 4,000,000 births in the US are discarded as medical waste, with less than a quarter of states requiring expectant parents to receive information about banking options. The Institute of Medicine recommended in 2005 that donors should be provided with clear information about their options for banking cord blood cells, including a balanced perspective on public and private blood banks. Informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery after adequate disclosure of information. The public education campaign is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of the Act, explaining its uses for individuals related or unrelated to the mother or newborn. It will also cover the differences between using one's own cord blood cells and using related or unrelated cord blood stem cells in disease treatment, as well as the distinctions between public and private cord blood banks. The publication on umbilical cord blood will explain its uses for individuals not biologically related to a mother or her newborn child. It will also cover the differences between using one's own cord blood cells and related or unrelated cord blood stem cells in disease treatment, as well as the distinctions between public and private cord blood banks. Options for a mother include donating stem cells to a public bank, storing them in a private family bank, or storing them for immediate or extended family use. Options for umbilical cord blood banking include donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, storing for family use, or discarding the stem cells. Medical processes and family history criteria can impact the decision. The curr_chunk discusses the medical processes involved in collecting cord blood, criteria affecting family decisions on umbilical cord blood banking, options for ownership and future use of donated cord blood, and the costs and availability of public and private cord blood banks. The curr_chunk provides information on the average cost, availability of public and private umbilical cord blood banking, including lists of banks, accreditation criteria, and availability of free family banking and sibling donor programs. It also explains which racial and ethnic groups are in need of publicly donated cord blood samples based on medical data. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document on cord blood disposition, to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. Certain professionals must disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must disclose information on umbilical cord blood banking options to pregnant women before the third trimester. They must also obtain written informed consent regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells at least 2 weeks before the woman's estimated delivery date. Healthcare providers must obtain written informed consent from pregnant women regarding cord blood stem cells before the woman's estimated delivery date, as mandated by the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act mandates that healthcare providers offering ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women who receive funding must comply with specific requirements and have a method to enforce them. Additionally, a new subsection is added to Section 1903 of the Act regarding these provisions. The Social Security Act requires healthcare providers offering prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with specific requirements and have a method to enforce them. Non-compliance by a state may result in a reduction in payment under the Act. Additionally, a new subsection is added to address these provisions in Section 1903 of the Act. The Social Security Act mandates compliance with specific requirements for prenatal care providers for pregnant women, with potential payment reductions for non-compliance. Amendments include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in various sections of the Act. Additionally, employer group health plans under ERISA must now inform pregnant women about blood cord banking. The Social Security Act requires prenatal care providers to inform pregnant women about blood cord banking. Amendments include mandating compliance with specific requirements and potential payment reductions for non-compliance. Employer group health plans under ERISA must also inform pregnant women about blood cord banking. The amendments made by this subsection require prenatal care providers to ensure compliance with specific requirements for pregnant women receiving care. The effective date applies to agreements and arrangements with physicians and health care professionals entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services to pregnant women. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may provide grants for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells to various groups, including health care providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
