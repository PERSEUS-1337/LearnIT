    "content": "The U.S. agriculture industry is experiencing changes that raise concerns about reduced competition, particularly in the dairy sector. Issues of consolidation and industry concentration are key worries. In response, the USDA and Department of Justice will hold workshops to address competition problems in agriculture. A workshop focusing on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report offers insights into the structure of the U.S. dairy industry and key dairy issues, including financial stress for farmers and the industry's historical development. The report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry, discussing financial stress for farmers, historical development, movements in prices, industry structure, economic effects of consolidation, and antitrust law. In 2009, the U.S. dairy industry faced financial stress due to lower milk prices, leading to government support programs totaling over $1 billion. Despite this assistance, the number of dairy farms and cows decreased by 3% and the industry saw a decline in milk production. In October 2009, the U.S. government provided $350 million in supplemental payments and purchased dairy products for domestic feeding programs. Despite this support, the number of dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 by December 31, 2009. The decline in dairy cows led to a drop in milk production, but increased foreign demand raised average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Financial concerns persist for dairy farmers who lost equity during the milk price collapse and face high feed prices. Financial concerns remain for dairy farmers who lost significant amounts of farm equity during the milk price collapse and continue to contend with high feed prices. The industry and Members of Congress are reconsidering options to handle fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers. The Obama Administration and some Members of Congress are also examining issues of consolidation and concentration in the dairy industry. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years due to advancements in milk marketing and government intervention. Urban areas led to the need for processors to supply milk products. Producers formed cooperatives by the turn of the 20th century. Government intervention in the market led to the formation of cooperative associations among dairy farmers in the early 1900s. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited exemption from antitrust liability to farmer cooperatives. Handlers started paying farmers based on classified pricing for fluid-grade milk by 1925. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 allowed dairy farmers to negotiate collectively with milk buyers. Handlers began paying farmers based on classified pricing for fluid-grade milk by 1925, with milk for fluid use valued at the highest level. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established during the Great Depression to stabilize the market and ensure adequate milk supplies at reasonable prices. During the Great Depression, Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market and equalize the market power of dairy farmers with processors. Import quotas were enacted to protect producers, and during World War II, demand for milk increased. In the late 1940s, the government supported milk prices through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. Additional programs such as the Dairy Export Incentives Program and Milk Income Loss Contract were added to national dairy policy. In the early 20th century, advancements in milk marketing transformed the U.S. dairy industry. Raw milk was transported by truck and rail to processing plants, ranging from local markets to large cities like New York and Chicago. Milk was primarily bottled for home delivery during this time. Over the last century, advancements in milk marketing transformed the U.S. dairy industry. Raw milk was transported by truck and rail to processing plants, ranging from local markets to large cities like New York and Chicago. By the 1970s, improved roadways and larger tanker trucks facilitated the transition to a national milk and dairy product market. In the second half of the 20th century, factors like improved roadways and larger tanker trucks reduced milk transportation costs, leading to a national dairy market. Retail milk sales shifted to stores in lightweight containers. Bulk milk is now transported long distances by truck to meet market demands. Dairy manufacturing plants ship products like cheese and yogurt nationwide. The relationship between farm and retail prices has been a long-standing issue in the dairy industry. In recent decades, factors like increased agricultural productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food production have led to a decline in the farm share of the retail food dollar. This has raised concerns about the economic stress on dairy farmers and the relationship between farm and retail prices. In recent decades, factors like increased agricultural productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food production have led to a decline in the farm share of the retail food dollar. The farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products was 41% in 1950, but in 2006, it was estimated to be 18.5% for all food products of U.S. farm origin. Milk and dairy products have a farm share of approximately one-third of the retail dollar. In 2006, USDA estimated that the average farm-value share of all food products of U.S. farm origin consumed was 18.5%, with milk and dairy products having a farm share of approximately one-third of the retail dollar. The farm share trend for milk and dairy products was generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with slight variations in different product categories. The trend for milk and dairy products was generally flat from 2000 to 2008. Farm-share trend was flat for whole milk, butter, and ice cream, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values and a widening of the marketing margin. Retailers reduced prices in 2009 due to lower costs for farm milk and other inputs. In 2009, the marketing margin for milk increased to $2.35 per gallon, reaching a record-high of $2.43 per gallon in January. Retailers lowered prices throughout the year due to lower farm milk costs, reducing the difference between farm and retail prices to $1.69 per gallon by December. The price spread returned to the five-year average level in early 2010. Retail price adjustments to farm price changes have time lags of months, even for perishable products like milk. In early 2010, farm prices weakened slightly and the price spread returned to the five-year average level. Retail prices have time lags in response to farm price changes, with adjustments from higher farm prices occurring faster and with greater pass-through to the consumer than adjustments to decreases in farm prices. Retail prices follow commodity prices upward rapidly but fall back slowly and partially when commodity prices recede due to consumer behavior and retailing strategies. Retail prices may not fully adjust to downward farm price movements due to consumer behavior, inventory management, and retail strategies. Competition effects of supermarket services can lead to stores attracting less price-sensitive consumers, resulting in higher prices for products like milk. This \"disconnect\" between farm and retail prices does not necessarily indicate excessive market power by retailers. Consolidation in agriculture has led to fewer, larger operations in the dairy sector, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. This has led to fewer dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Firm size is a limiting factor for growth in the industry. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to fewer, larger operations across the marketing chain, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. This trend has also led to a decline in the number of dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Firm size remains a limiting factor for growth in the industry, with concentration increasing as a small number of firms control most of the sales or purchases. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to fewer, larger operations across the marketing chain, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. Concentration has increased as a small number of firms control most of the sales or purchases. The dairy industry has become more concentrated over time, with a sharp reduction in the number of dairy farms due to increased dairy cow output and advances in dairy farm technology. Annual losses in dairy farm operations have slowed in recent years, totaling 65,000 on December 31, 2009. In the late 1960s and 1970s, losses in dairy farm operations averaged 96,000 and 37,000 respectively. Currently, there is a slower decline of about 2,000 to 5,000 farms per year, with a total of 65,000 operations in 2009. Despite a decrease in the number of dairy farms, total milk production has increased due to higher productivity per cow. Domestic milk demand has grown slowly, while exports of dairy products have reached record levels. Farm numbers have varied based on size, with smaller farms experiencing declines and larger farms increasing in number. Exports of dairy products have increased in recent years, reaching record levels in 2008. Between 2005 and 2009, farms with fewer than 500 cows registered declines, while farms with 500 to 999 cows held steady. In contrast, farms with 1,000 or more cows increased 20%, driven by significantly lower costs of production. In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more. In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more, benefiting from scale economies and modern facilities that reduce costs. Large dairy farms in the U.S. benefit from scale economies and modern facilities, with larger farms in the western states and smaller farms in Wisconsin. Operating costs in western states have been affected by high feed costs, but overhead costs tend to be relatively low. Cost structure varies by state, with large dairy farms in western states facing high feed costs due to purchasing feed. Overhead costs are low as they can be spread over a large number of animals. In contrast, farms in Wisconsin with fewer cows tend to have higher per-unit overhead costs but lower operating costs when grain and feed prices rise. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives manage milk distribution systems for the benefit of members. The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s as cooperatives merged to take advantage of economic gains from more centralized management of milk supplies and disposition. During 1940-1941, the number of dairy cooperatives totaled over 2,300 and accounted for just under one-half of farm milk marketings. By 2007, the number of cooperatives has decreased. The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s, with consolidations and strategic alliances enabling them to serve large retail customers by increasing volume and achieving operational efficiencies. In 2008, 79% of the milk produced in the United States was marketed by the 50 largest dairy cooperatives. Consolidation among dairy cooperatives has allowed them to serve large retail customers by increasing volume and operational efficiencies. In 2008, the top four cooperatives accounted for 40% of U.S. milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act in allowing farmers to take cooperative action and remain independent producers. The National Milk Producers Federation highlights the significance of the Capper-Volstead Act in enabling farmers to collaborate through cooperatives, improving their bargaining power with milk handlers and influencing federal milk marketing orders. Some producers argue that cooperatives may not always align with their interests. The dairy processing industry involves processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese, facing challenges from changing demand trends. The dairy processing industry has been impacted by changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. Despite a decline in the number of dairy firms, the number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized. Some argue that cooperatives may not always align with the interests of farmers. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the dairy processing industry are similar to other food processing sectors, with the four-firm concentration ratio at 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in 2002. In 2002, the four-firm concentration ratio was 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing, compared to a mean industry concentration ratio of 49% for selected food processing industries. Dairy processing concentration levels are not unusually high nationally, but local markets can be more concentrated. The fluid milk industry's concentration has increased recently due to a merger between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods in 2001. The fluid milk industry has seen an increase in concentration levels following a merger in 2001 between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods. Despite this, industry concentration remains just below the average for selected food manufacturing industries. Changes in the retail sector, including competition from nontraditional food retailers, have led traditional supermarket chains to reassess pricing and product strategies. The retail sector for food products has changed significantly in recent years due to price competition from nontraditional food retailers. This has led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry, with the top four firms accounting for 36% of national sales by 2005. National-level concentration ratios are important for food product suppliers negotiating terms of product sales with retailers. The retail food sector saw a significant shift in the early 1990s, with the top four grocery retailers accounting for 36% of national sales by 2005. Local-level concentration in the sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm shares ranging from 63% to 85% in specific market areas. This local-level concentration is more crucial for consumers compared to national measures. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found that local-level concentration in the food retail sector ranged from 63% to 85% in specific markets. This high concentration limits consumer choices and has led to retail consolidation and increased market share for dairy processors. Concerns exist that this concentration could reduce competition in the marketplace for agricultural and food products. The trend in the dairy industry is towards consolidation and increased market share to meet demands for lower costs. Concentration may reduce competition but could also lead to efficiency gains and lower retail prices, benefiting consumers and farmers. The Government Accountability Office has not definitively linked concentration in the processing segment of the beef, pork, or dairy industries to negative outcomes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing segment of the beef, pork, or dairy sectors, or the retail sector overall, has not adversely affected agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Most studies reviewed showed no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. However, experts predict increased concentration in the future, raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing, finding that concentration had little impact on commodity or food prices. Experts predict increased concentration in the future, raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. The report also noted that efficiency benefits from concentration outweigh market power effects, and the market power of dairy processors can be offset by dairy cooperatives. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and market power. Efficiency benefits from concentration were found to outweigh market power effects. Evidence of noncompetitive behavior was observed in regional retail milk markets. Experts predict increased concentration in the future, leading to fewer retail outlets. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and market power, finding that concentration benefits outweigh market power effects. Evidence of noncompetitive behavior was seen in regional retail milk markets. Experts predict increased concentration in the future, leading to fewer retail outlets. Concerns were raised about how concentration affects price transparency in dairy product markets. Concentration in the dairy industry can lead to further consolidation at the retail and food processor levels, impacting price transparency. Fewer transactions due to fewer buyers and sellers weaken market discovery of prices. The move towards a more integrated market with custom contracts results in fewer trades on the spot market, reducing the availability of current price information. The dairy industry is moving towards a more integrated market with custom contracts, leading to fewer trades on the spot market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for dairy products like cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. Prices set at the CME are used to establish wholesale price contracts nationwide, impacting monthly minimum prices set by USDA for farm milk. Some dairy producer groups question the effectiveness of the CME as a pricing mechanism. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) sets wholesale dairy product prices, which in turn impact monthly minimum prices for farm milk set by USDA. Some dairy producer groups criticize the CME for being thinly traded, lacking transparency, and creating market volatility. The GAO identified the CME spot cheese market as susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. The CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. Industry participants are prepared to counteract any attempted price manipulation by monitoring the market closely. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for signs of manipulation. Some industry participants want to increase sales volume on the CME to reduce the possibility of manipulation. The CME and CFTC monitor spot market activities for price manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants paid a penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices. The CME introduced new futures contracts for skimmed milk powder to enhance dairy risk management globally. Producers and policymakers aim to improve dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's price reporting system. The CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a global dairy risk management tool with six delivery points. Producers and policymakers are interested in expanding USDA's price reporting system for dairy products to improve transparency. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition and illegal mergers, leaving courts to determine violations based on each case. U.S. antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, focus on competition in markets and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. These laws are enforced by the DOJ or FTC, and individuals can claim economic injury from violations. The Sherman Act prohibits activities that restrain trade, including agreements among firms not to compete. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act prohibit activities that restrain trade and unlawful mergers. Violations can result in fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations, or imprisonment of up to 10 years. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition, with fines of up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations, or imprisonment of up to 10 years. It also allows for premerger notification to examine potential mergers/acquisitions before consummation. The \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect actual practices. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition and allows for premerger notification. The DOJ/FTC may seek remedies such as legal action or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption for agriculture. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption for agriculture, allowing farmer cooperatives to collaborate in processing and marketing their products. This exemption helps avoid antitrust issues that may arise from mergers or duplicative operations. In April 2009, Dean Foods, the largest fluid milk processor in the United States, purchased two plants owned by Foremost Farms, a cooperative in Wisconsin. The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods, alleging that the purchase violated the Clayton Act by eliminating a competitor and lessening competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains. The DOJ filed a lawsuit against Dean Foods for violating the Clayton Act by acquiring Foremost Farms, leading to reduced competition in the milk market for schools and grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The acquisition eliminated head-to-head competition between Dean and Foremost, impacting school and fluid milk purchases. The transaction was not reported to the DOJ beforehand. The DOJ filed a lawsuit against Dean Foods for acquiring Foremost Farms, leading to reduced competition in the milk market. Dean Foods now holds 57% of the market in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Dean Foods believes the acquisition complies with antitrust laws and benefits dairy farmers. The ongoing case highlights the impact of consolidation in the industry. Dean Foods acquisition of Foremost Farms is under scrutiny by the DOJ for potential antitrust violations. The company claims the acquisition benefits dairy farmers and consumers by providing cost savings and competition in the region. A class action antitrust complaint was filed against major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. A class action antitrust complaint was filed against four major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants conspired to control the supply of fluid milk in the region, leading to lower prices for farmers. The lawsuit alleges that Dairy Farmers of America and Dairy Marketing Services, along with Dean Foods and HP Hood, conspired to control the fluid milk supply in the Northeast, resulting in lower prices for farmers. Dairy producers are now required to affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with the region's dominant processors. The defendants have been accused of using their market power to the detriment of dairy farmers in the Northeast. The lawsuit alleges that Dairy Farmers of America and Dairy Marketing Services, along with Dean Foods and HP Hood, conspired to control the fluid milk supply in the Northeast, resulting in lower prices for farmers. DFA has stated that they have helped increase returns for dairy farmers through efficiencies, despite the allegations of market power abuse. Observers predict a lengthy legal process for the ongoing case involving multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States. The ongoing litigation involves multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA. Determining the net effect of concentration on the dairy market is complex due to various factors influencing prices and market dynamics. Market power and efficiency gains play a significant role, influenced by factors like product differentiation, market entry ease, and contract structures. Economic events and government policies also impact commodity prices, making it challenging to isolate the effects of concentration. Efficiency gains in the dairy industry can come from technology changes and business practices, while economic events and government policies can impact commodity prices. It is challenging to determine the effects of concentration on the dairy market due to various factors at play."
