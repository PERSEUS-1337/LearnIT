    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims the right to sue in Federal court and questioning the validity of regulations. It also challenges expectations set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Sandoval decision undermines protections against discrimination established by Congress under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by limiting the right to sue in Federal court and questioning the validity of regulations. Congress and the executive branch intended to use the regulatory process to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries of the law. The regulatory process was established by Congress and the executive branch to provide broad protections for beneficiaries of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The initial regulations under title VI of the Act prohibited discrimination and retaliation, drafted by the same officials involved in creating the law. These regulations remain valid since their inception in 1966. The regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, drafted by the same officials involved in creating the law, have never been invalidated. Congress rejected a proposal to invalidate these regulations in 1966, implying they accurately reflect congressional intent. Title VI was designed to benefit those discriminated against in litigation or administrative resolution of discrimination charges. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 regulations were not invalidated by Congress, indicating they reflect congressional intent. The Act aimed to benefit those facing discrimination and relied on private attorneys for enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' right to sue for discrimination under Title VI in Federal courts for effective enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' right to sue for discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Federal courts, recognizing an implied right of action despite the need for explicit statutory statements. Congress has consistently provided means for enforcing the statutes. Congress and the Courts have recognized an implied right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with Congress providing means for enforcing the statutes. In 1972, Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions under Title VI. The Supreme Court's denial of a right of action under regulations promulgated under Title VI in Sandoval was unfounded, as the regulations were congressionally mandated to \"effectuate\" the Act. Regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated to \"effectuate\" the antidiscrimination provisions of the statute. The regulations stress the importance of prohibiting practices that have the effect of discrimination, consistent with prohibitions of disparate treatment. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the disparate impact standard in reaching discrimination that could exist without intent. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the disparate impact standard in reaching discrimination that could exist without intent, as evidenced by key decisions such as Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp. An invidious purpose may often be inferred from the totality of relevant facts in cases of unlawful discrimination. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact not justified by program goals. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust highlights the importance of the disparate impact method in uncovering underlying stereotypes in intentional discrimination. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact not justified by program goals, as reinforced by the use of such a standard in enforcing title VII. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 after the Supreme Court wavered on its application under title VII. Congress reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to prevent unfair discrimination findings. Failure to confirm this right would leave equality enforcement solely to Federal agencies, potentially hindering necessary actions due to administrative burdens. Congress reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to prevent unfair discrimination findings. Without this right, enforcement would rely solely on Federal agencies, potentially hindering necessary actions due to administrative burdens. This private right of action is crucial to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services due to discriminatory practices. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination in various programs and services. The right to maintain this private right of action includes a waiver of sovereign immunity, ensuring individuals have a remedy for unjustified discriminatory effects. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination in various programs and services, including a waiver of sovereign immunity. SEC. 3 prohibits discrimination. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to address discrimination based on disparate impact, requiring a covered entity to show that their policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires a covered entity to demonstrate that a policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals or adopt a less discriminatory alternative policy if one exists. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires a covered entity to demonstrate that a policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals or adopt a less discriminatory alternative policy if one exists. In demonstrating disparate impact, the aggrieved person must show that each challenged policy causes such impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. If a specific policy is shown not to cause disparate impact, the entity is not required to prove its necessity for program goals. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires a covered entity to demonstrate that a policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. If a specific policy does not cause disparate impact, the entity is not required to prove its necessity for program goals. No person in the United States shall face discrimination for opposing any prohibited policy or practice. In the amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \"demonstrates\" means meeting burdens of production and persuasion. No person in the United States shall be discriminated against for opposing prohibited policies or practices. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the Act to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Adds a new section 602A to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actions brought by aggrieved persons. In actions based on intentional discrimination, aggrieved persons can seek legal and equitable relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. However, punitive damages are not available against government entities. In cases of discrimination based on disparate impact, aggrieved persons can also seek equitable relief. In cases of discrimination based on disparate impact, aggrieved persons may recover equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. The Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and effective as of that date. They apply to all actions or proceedings pending on or after April 24, 2001, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
