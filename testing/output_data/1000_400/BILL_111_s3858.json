    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders under nonimmigrant status for up to 3 years, with the possibility of extension. Aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders can be admitted for an initial 3-year period, with the option for a 3-year extension. Employers hiring H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from showing seasonal or temporary nature. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status may adjust to lawful permanent resident status. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status in dairy worker, sheepherder, or goat herder positions can seek immigrant visa under specific conditions. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status in dairy worker, sheepherder, or goat herder positions can seek immigrant visa under specific conditions without the need for labor certification. The petition for classification can be filed by the alien's employer or the eligible alien themselves. No labor certification is required for eligible aliens seeking an immigrant visa under specific conditions. Filing a petition or adjustment of status based on the petition will not affect other H-2A worker-related requests or visa applications. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition for H-2A worker-related requests or visa applications. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of eligible aliens with pending or approved petitions for H-2A worker-related requests or visa applications in 1-year increments until a final decision is made on their adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. This does not prevent eligible aliens from seeking status adjustment through other legal provisions. In accordance with the law, eligible aliens can seek adjustment of status for permanent residence. This provision does not hinder them from pursuing status adjustment through other legal means."
