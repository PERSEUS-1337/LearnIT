    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress recognizes the importance of reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to power the growing US economy. Coal, which currently generates over half of the country's electricity, is abundant and can sustain the US for 250 years at current usage rates. Coal accounts for over half of US electricity generation and is the most abundant fossil energy resource, comprising more than 85% of all fossil resources. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years, allowing for continued use of coal and preservation of other energy resources. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance from electricity generating facilities would allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%. However, initial commercial deployment of these technologies entails significant risks in a competitive electricity market. Continued research and development aim for near-zero emissions in coal-based generation. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years. Continued research and development towards near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important and desirable, despite the significant risks in a competitive electricity market. In this Act, \"cost and performance goals\" refer to the goals established under section 4, and \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess technologies for cost-competitive coal use in electricity generation, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various stakeholders is required to establish cost and performance goals. The Secretary will work with stakeholders to establish cost and performance goals for technologies related to coal use in various industries. The draft goals will be issued for public comment within 120 days of the Act's enactment, with final goals submitted to Congress within 180 days. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving goals. Recommendations for technology development programs will be included. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving goals. Recommendations for technology development programs will be included, with due weight given to expert advice from representatives of relevant entities. SEC. 6. TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary will conduct research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of coal-based technologies under various Acts. The program aims to achieve cost and performance goals. \n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $100,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2002-2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. Not a cap on Department of Energy fossil energy research and development. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants, including coproduction plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards and may include new technologies not previously considered for commercial use. Within 120 days of enactment, the Secretary will submit a plan to Congress outlining the initiative. The Secretary will submit a plan to Congress within 120 days of enactment, detailing program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies in power plants. The Secretary will submit a plan to Congress within 120 days of enactment, detailing program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies in power plants, including efficiency improvements and environmental performance enhancements. The Act requires significant improvements in environmental performance for coal-based generating units, including new technologies to control sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury at a lower cost. It also emphasizes recycling coal combustion wastes and capturing and reusing emissions. The Act mandates advancements in environmental performance for coal-based generating units, focusing on controlling sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury at a reduced cost. It also highlights the recycling of coal combustion wastes and the capture and reuse of emissions, excluding commercially available practices. Additionally, it requires the development of cost-effective means to capture, separate, and reuse or dispose of carbon dioxide. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Projects may demonstrate efficiency improvements and emissions reductions without increasing pollutants. The Act requires existing facilities to maintain current emission levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, and carbon monoxide. It also mandates a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions based on the type of coal being used. The Act mandates existing facilities to maintain current emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. For coal with a potential combustion concentration of less than 1.2 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input, sulfur dioxide emissions should be reduced by 15 percent. Nitrogen oxide emissions should be limited to 0.1 pound per million British thermal units of heat for boilers other than cyclone-fired boilers. Cyclone-fired boilers should reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 15 percent of the uncontrolled emissions. The emission levels for pollutants in advanced coal-based technology must meet specified standards from the Clean Air Act or be lower than current levels for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Cyclone-fired boilers have specific emission requirements for nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to projects that demonstrate cost reductions in coal utilization for energy generation. The projects must meet emission standards set by the Clean Air Act or have lower levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions. Additionally, coal combustion byproducts produced must have economic values significantly greater than current byproducts. The Secretary will offer financial aid to projects that show cost reductions in coal use for energy generation, without increasing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. Projects must also enhance coal's competitiveness among energy sources and demonstrate applicable technologies for 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal government will provide financial assistance for projects that reduce coal usage for energy generation without increasing harmful emissions. The projects must demonstrate technologies applicable to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities and the Federal share of project costs will not exceed 50%. Additionally, $100,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2002 through 2012 for this initiative. The Secretary is authorized to use $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for projects under this section. Alternative funding sources can be used, but appropriations will be reduced accordingly."
