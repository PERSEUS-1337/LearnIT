    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, when an omnibus funding bill was signed on April 15, 2011, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill, signed on April 15, 2011, provided $659.9 billion for DOD activities, with a $18.2 billion reduction from the President's request. Additionally, $17.8 billion was allocated for DOD's military construction budget, a $2.2 billion decrease from the President's request. The bill included $4.4 billion in reductions, with $2.0 billion rescinded from prior DOD funds and $1.5 billion cut proportionately from all projects and programs funded by the bill's accounts. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill included $4.4 billion in reductions, with cuts applied to various spending categories and specific programs. Notable reductions included $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from other major weapons programs. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill made significant cuts to major weapons programs, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. Additionally, the bill added funds for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard, medical research, innovative research, and Israeli missile defense systems. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill added funds for various programs, including $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard equipment, $661.7 million for medical research, $523.2 million for innovative research, $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense, and $165.0 million for Military Career Advancement. The bill did not allocate funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House version of the bill authorized $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act included funding for various defense programs but did not allocate funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House version authorized $725.9 billion for defense activities, slightly less than the Administration's request. The Senate version proposed a reduction in funding and faced opposition due to a provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate rejected a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act. A compromise version of the bill was passed without the provision and signed into law on January 7, 2011. Both House and Senate versions supported the Administration's budget request. The bill (H.R. 6523) cleared for the President on December 22, 2010, was signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383). Both House and Senate versions supported the Administration's budget request, with differences on military pay increase and funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter engine development. The enacted FY2011 bill authorized a 1.4% increase in military pay and $485 million for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, contrary to the President's request for a 1.9% pay raise and termination of the engine project. The FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending for military activities. Additionally, $5.3 billion in mandatory spending was allocated, including funds for military retirees. The FY2011 budget request for national defense included $733.3 billion in discretionary spending for military activities. This also encompassed $5.3 billion in mandatory spending, with the largest portion allocated for military retirees receiving concurrent receipt of their full military pension and a disability pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, $159.3 billion was requested for ongoing military operations, primarily funding campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, bringing the total DOD request for FY2011 to $708.3 billion. The Administration requested $33 billion in supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs to deploy additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total amount appropriated for war costs to $162.6 billion. The FY2011 war budget request was $159.3 billion, reflecting a shift in emphasis from Iraq to Afghanistan. The Administration's FY2011 war budget request was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than the FY2010 war budget. The budget reflected a shift from Iraq to Afghanistan operations. An additional $655 million was requested for humanitarian relief in Haiti after the earthquake. DOD was exempt from the budget freeze on discretionary spending for security agencies. The DOD relief effort in response to the 2010 earthquake included deploying Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel. The Administration requested a budget increase for security agencies, including DOD, State Department, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and NNSA, totaling $719.2 billion for discretionary programs. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, which is a 5.2% increase from FY2010. For non-security agencies, the request was $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010, providing a 3.4% increase in real purchasing power. The requested FY2011 DOD base budget of $548.9 billion is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010, providing a 3.4% increase in real purchasing power. This continues the upward trend in DOD base budgets since FY1998, with projected annual increases exceeding inflation for the following four years. The FY2011 DOD base budget is the third largest since the Korean War, with projected annual increases exceeding inflation for the following four years. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain current forces with future budgets. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain current forces with future budgets, acknowledging the challenge of achieving necessary real growth rates in the defense budget. He suggested shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces while reducing spending on administrative and support activities. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to increase support for combat forces while reducing spending on administrative and support activities. This would convert overhead costs to force structure and modernization, aiming for roughly two to three percent real growth. Secretary Gates aimed to shift funds from administrative and support functions to combat units to increase support for forces and modernization. This would convert overhead costs to real growth of about 3% in the budget for combat-related activities. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce costs in DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in service support contractors, a decrease in the number of generals and admirals, and the elimination of certain departments. These measures aimed to increase efficiency and shift funds to directly support combat units, resulting in a 3% real increase in the budget for combat-related activities. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce costs in DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in service support contractors, a decrease in the number of senior DOD civilians by 150, and the elimination of certain departments like the Joint Forces Command and the Business Transformation Agency. Additionally, contracting and acquisition initiatives were introduced to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, aiming to save costs in the department's annual spending. Initiatives introduced by Secretary Gates aimed to reduce costs in DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in service support contractors and a decrease in senior DOD civilians. Changes in contracting rules were implemented to lower the cost of contracts for services. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the projected budget increases being insufficient to cover rising personnel and operational costs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon warned that the planned budgets could lead to scaling back acquisition programs. Some Members of Congress are concerned about rising personnel and operational costs in the defense budget. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon warned that planned budgets may lead to scaling back acquisition programs. Representative Barney Frank has called for reductions in the DOD budget by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and reducing overseas military deployments. Representative Barney Frank has called for reductions in the DOD budget, aiming to terminate unnecessary weapons programs and scale back overseas military deployments. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction efforts may lead to devastating cuts in federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request remains at 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off in the DOD's share of GDP since 9/11. The FY2011 DOD base budget request remains at 3.6% of the GDP, reflecting the strategy and force planning assumptions from the Quadrennial Defense Review. The budget sustains previous initiatives with fewer changes to major weapons programs compared to the FY2010 request. The FY2011 budget request aligns with the Quadrennial Defense Review's strategy and force planning assumptions, emphasizing readiness for diverse missions over Cold War-era scenarios. Key assumptions in the 2010 QDR influence the Administration's budget priorities, focusing on fighting and winning. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be ready for diverse missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. The 2010 QDR recommends increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft for counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade for improved mobility. The report assumes that no adversary in the next 10-20 years will directly challenge U.S. conventional military capabilities. The 2010 QDR recommends increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft for counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations. It also suggests converting more BCTs for improved mobility as resources become available. The report challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum and asserts that adversaries will likely challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically with unconventional tactics and technologies. The 2010 QDR challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum and emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to operate effectively in cyberspace. It calls for strengthening capabilities to defend cyber-networks and highlights the use of unconventional tactics and technologies by adversaries. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the military's ability to operate effectively in cyberspace, calling for strengthening capabilities to defend cyber-networks and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced cyber security. It also highlights the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace and centralizing command of cyber operations. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to handle multiple missions of different types around the globe, including stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and supporting civil authorities in times of disaster or terrorist attacks. It also focuses on addressing asymmetric threats. The 2010 QDR highlights the need to prepare U.S. forces for various global missions, including deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and supporting civil authorities during disasters or terrorist attacks. It specifically addresses the threat of \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities being developed by China and other potential adversaries, which could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, crucial for projecting power in distant regions. China or Iran could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, crucial for projecting power in distant regions. The cost of power projection capabilities is a reason for high U.S. defense spending. Overseas bases and naval forces may be vulnerable to various attacks. The U.S. power projection capabilities, including overseas ground bases and naval forces, are increasingly vulnerable to various attacks such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, submarines, and small explosive-laden boats. The QDR recommends countering these anti-access strategies by increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines that are less vulnerable. This may include a new manned or unmanned bomber armed with long-range cruise missiles. The QDR recommends countering anti-access strategies by increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines. This may include a new manned or unmanned bomber armed with long-range cruise missiles. Measures to defeat enemy sensors and engagement systems include developing offensive \"electronic attack\" capabilities. Missile defense may be a major part of protecting forward deployed forces in the FY2011 budget request. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. Since the start of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the end strength of the Army and Marine Corps has rebounded to 562,400. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a reduction in active-duty end-strength across all services in the early 1990s. The Army and Marine Corps saw a rebound in end-strength to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, due to combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress authorized an increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400 in FY2011, with a $1 billion budget for a 1.4% raise in basic pay for military personnel. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay, reflecting an Army end-strength of 569,400. The raise was in line with private-sector pay increases, with additional adjustments to the Basic Allowance for Housing. Congress has consistently approved military pay raises higher than the Employment Cost Index increase since FY2004, citing the need to catch up with civilian pay hikes. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better paid than 70% of private sector workers with similar experience and responsibilities. In FY2011, Congress approved raises in military basic pay higher than the ECI increase to catch up with civilian pay hikes. DOD officials argue that service members are better paid than 70% of private sector workers. Advocacy groups push for a higher increase to close the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The FY2011 DOD funding bills sparked legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals serving in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the policy due to the stress of deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the policy due to the stress of deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Obama called for repealing the 1993 legislation and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination against persons with a same-sex orientation. DOD launched a study on this issue. President Obama called for repealing the 1993 legislation and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination against persons with a same-sex orientation. DOD launched a study on how this change would be implemented, with Secretary Gates opposing repeal until the study is completed. Changes in enforcement procedures were announced, requiring allegations of homosexual conduct to be given under oath. In May 2010, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, pending completion of a DOD review and certification from key officials. The DOD review has been completed, and key officials have certified to Congress that policies are in place for the repeal of the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. The Administration supports the draft amendment, despite preferring that congressional action wait for the DOD study to finish. Secretary Gates maintains that military readiness and effectiveness should be maintained during the implementation of the repeal. The Administration supports the draft amendment to repeal the 'don't ask, don't tell' law, despite the DOD study not being completed. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010, with a temporary stay issued by the Ninth Circuit on October 19, 2010. On September 9, 2010, Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the 1993 law unconstitutional, with a temporary stay issued by the Ninth Circuit on October 19, 2010. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The FY2011 budget included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system serving 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, which serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The cost of the system has more than doubled in the past 10 years and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The DOD budget for health care has doubled in the past 10 years and is projected to increase annually. Factors contributing to the rising costs include increased usage of TRICARE, legislative benefit increases, and stagnant fees since 1995. Proposed fee increases have been consistently blocked by Congress. The Bush and Obama administrations proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries, but Congress consistently blocked them. Secretary Gates expressed the need for cost control in the program while ensuring care for military personnel. The FY2011 request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from R&D. This was part of efforts to control costs in the program while ensuring care for military personnel. The FY2011 budget request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from R&D. This shift reflected the transition into production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, with proposed cuts in major weapons programs and the exclusion of funds for additional C-17 cargo jets and alternate F-35 jet engine development. The FY2011 budget request did not include funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or alternate F-35 jet engine development, which Congress had added funding for in 2009. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, particularly the design of the proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle. The Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, with a budget request of $3.2 billion in FY2011, has faced scrutiny from Congress, especially regarding the controversial design of the proposed Ground Combat Vehicle. This program replaced the Future Combat System, which aimed to develop new combat equipment to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle component of the Future Combat System. The Army's Future Combat System aimed to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems connected by a network. Secretary Gates recommended canceling the manned ground vehicle component due to design flaws not reflecting lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army replaced it with the GCV program to field fighting vehicles based on mature technologies. Congress may question if the Army is rushing GCV development, risking potential oversights. The Army replaced the manned ground vehicle component of the Future Combat System with the GCV program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. Congress may question if the Army is rushing the development of the GCV, potentially inviting undue risk. The Army replaced the manned ground vehicle component of the Future Combat System with the GCV program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. The Army restarted the GCV competition on November 30, 2010, and plans to incorporate other elements of the FCS program into its Modernization program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the FCS components planned for deployment. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget includes funding for the procurement of nine new battle force ships. The Army replaced the manned ground vehicle component of the Future Combat System with the GCV program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget requested funding for the procurement of nine new battle force ships, including submarines, destroyers, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes 50 new battle force ships over five years, with half being relatively inexpensive LCSs or JHSVs. The FY2011 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships, not enough to fully support the 313-ship goal. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes 50 new battle force ships over five years, with half being relatively inexpensive LCSs or JHSVs. The FY2011 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships, not enough to fully support the 313-ship goal. The Navy projects a fleet growth from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024, then declining below 313 ships in FY2027. The Navy estimates that executing the 30-year shipbuilding plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes a projected fleet of 301 ships in FY2039-FY2040, with concerns about the attack submarine and cruiser-destroyer forces falling below required levels. The plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, but a Congressional Budget Office report estimates it would need $19.0 billion per year. If funding remains at current levels, the Navy may not be able to afford all the purchases in the 2011 plan. The CBO report warns that if the Navy continues to receive the same funding for ship construction as in the past 30 years, it may not be able to afford all purchases in the 2011 plan. Specific shipbuilding issues discussed include the development of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. The SSBN(X) program received funding in the Navy's FY2010 budget and requested additional funding in the FY2011 budget. The Navy's SSBN(X) program, aimed at replacing the Ohio-class submarines, received significant funding in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets. The procurement cost for each SSBN(X) is estimated to be $6-7 billion. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the Navy's long-term shipbuilding affordability. The Navy's SSBN(X) program, aimed at replacing the Ohio-class submarines, has raised concerns about its impact on the Navy's long-term shipbuilding affordability. The procurement cost for each SSBN(X) is estimated to be $6-7 billion, which could lead to reductions in procurement rates for other types of Navy ships. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its potential impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer than 12 SSBN(X)s. The Navy's SSBN(X) program, aimed at replacing the Ohio-class submarines, has raised concerns about its impact on the Navy's long-term shipbuilding affordability. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its potential impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer than 12 SSBN(X)s, reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to be carried by each SSBN(X), designing the SSBN(X) to carry a smaller SLBM, stretching out the schedule for procuring SSBN(X)s, making greater use of split funding, funding the procurement of SSBN(X)s in a part of the Department of Defense (DOD) budget other than the Navy's shipbuilding account, and increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The Navy's FY2010 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. Congress supported this proposal. The FY2011 budget called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The budget also proposed terminating the CG(X) cruiser program and building an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. The Navy's FY2011 budget called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The budget also proposed terminating the CG(X) cruiser program and building an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s are to carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget requested $228.4 million in research and development funding for the AMDR. The Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the planned increase in numbers, especially with the intention to use these ships to defend Europe against potential ballistic missile attacks. The Aegis BMD program faces concerns over the increasing demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships, particularly for defending Europe against ballistic missile attacks. There are worries that the Navy's ability to provide these ships for non-BMD missions may be strained. The program is mainly funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy for BMD-related efforts in FY2011. The Navy's budget provides additional funding for BMD-related efforts, with MDA's proposed FY2011 budget requesting $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. FY2011 issues for Congress included decisions on the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests for the Aegis BMD program, and providing additional direction for the program. The FY2011 budget also requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), which are small vessels designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy planned to choose between two different LCS designs by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, but later decided to select a single design for all LCSs procured in subsequent years. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period. The Navy planned to choose between two different LCS designs by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting a single design for all LCSs procured in subsequent years. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period, with a second competition to select a second shipyard to build additional LCSs. The Navy planned to choose between two different LCS designs by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting a single design for all LCSs procured in subsequent years. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period, with a second competition to select a second shipyard to build additional LCSs. Navy officials sought approval from Congress to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team for a total of 20 ships. There are concerns about a fighter aircraft shortfall due to budgetary limits on replacement fighters. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortages due to budget constraints on replacement planes. Air Force officials project a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials anticipate a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force, with fears of a budget \"train wreck\" as acquisition plans clash with limited funding. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is key to DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans, with plans to acquire 2,443 JSFs at a cost of over $300 billion. Concerns about affordability and budget constraints have been ongoing in Congress regarding tactical aircraft modernization. The F-35 program plans to acquire 2,443 JSFs at a cost of over $300 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the program. Concerns exist about the affordability of the F-35 in the face of constrained DOD resources. The F-35 program requires over $10 billion annually for acquisition funding, raising concerns about affordability in the face of constrained DOD resources. Supporters argue that the F-35 is a cost-effective solution for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The British government announced a plan to reduce the number of F-35 aircraft they planned to buy from 138 to as few as 40, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program to develop an alternative engine for the F-35. The British government plans to reduce their purchase of F-35 aircraft. Congress has repeatedly rejected proposals to end the development of an alternative engine for the F-35, despite estimated additional costs of $2.9 billion to complete the program. The DOD estimated an additional $2.9 billion would be needed to complete the F136 engine development. Critics argue termination was due to budget pressures, while supporters claim single-source engine contracts are more cost-effective in the long run. The F136 engine program termination raises concerns about operational risk, impact on the defense industrial base, and efficiency in DOD's acquisition system. Critics argue for single-source engine contracts for long-term affordability, while supporters highlight the benefits of engine competition for cost savings and reliability. The termination of the F136 engine program raises concerns about its impact on the U.S. defense industrial base, relations with allied countries, and cost control in a single-supplier environment. Continuing F136 development could affect the F-35 acquisition program and raise operational concerns from supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget includes funding for the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker program. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget includes funding for the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker program, which aims to replace the aging fleet of KC-135 tankers. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for the program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, with bidding closing on a contract valued at roughly $35 billion. On February 24, 2010, the Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at roughly $35 billion. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids: Northrop Grumman/EADS, Boeing, and a team of Antonov and U.S. Aerospace. The bids included tanker designs based on the Airbus A330, Boeing 767, and An-124 freighter, respectively. The Department of Defense announced on February 24, 2011, that Boeing would be awarded the contract for the new KC-X tanker. EADS decided not to challenge this decision on March 4. The KC-X acquisition program has been of great interest due to its value, job creation potential, and importance to U.S. military operations. The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is crucial in understanding the context of the current competition.

The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is crucial in understanding the context of the current competition. The Obama Administration dropped the plan to deploy a modified version of the land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic in favor of the Phased Adaptive Approach. The Obama Administration shifted from deploying a land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic to the Phased Adaptive Approach, focusing on BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. They requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for PAA programs, including development efforts unique to PAA and procurement of the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. In FY2011, $2.27 billion was allocated for programs related to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA), with $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing decreased by nearly 20% compared to FY2010, mainly due to reduced spending on new facilities for units relocating from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Military family housing budget also decreased from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion in the FY2011 request. The FY2011 DOD budget included funding for new facilities for units relocating due to the 2005 BRAC Commission. Military family housing budget decreased from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion in FY2011. Basic Allowance for Housing has increased to cover a larger proportion of service members' housing costs. The increase in service members living off-base is due to more paying rent to private landlords and policy changes in housing allowances. The DOD supports establishing Mayport, FL as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port for security reasons. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorses the Navy's plan to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port in Florida, citing the need to mitigate risks and shift economic activity from Norfolk. Members of Congress from Florida support the proposal. The proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport in Florida has received support from certain Members of Congress, who argue that the economic benefits and risk mitigation for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs outweigh the costs. However, some Members of Congress from Virginia are skeptical or opposed to the proposal, questioning the benefits and funding needed for implementation.
