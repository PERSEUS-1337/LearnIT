    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and decrease the risk of youth becoming victims of crime by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 2001. After school programs are effective in addressing youth social problems, with many governors supporting their expansion through a Federal/State partnership. After school programs are endorsed by governors and law enforcement officials to address social issues facing youth in the United States. These programs offer recreation, academic support, and community service for school-age children and teens. Associations representing 360,000 police officers urge public officials to provide after school programs with recreation, academic support, and community service for school-age children and teens in the United States, emphasizing the importance of safe and positive learning environments during after school hours. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, promoting safe after school environments, providing alternatives to negative activities, and reducing juvenile crime. The Act also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization.
