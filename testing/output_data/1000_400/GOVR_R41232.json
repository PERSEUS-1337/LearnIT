The FY2010 supplemental funding bill allocated $64.4 billion for various purposes, including disaster relief, foreign aid for Haiti, border security, and settlements for American Indians and black farmers. Different versions of the bill included rescissions and mandatory savings to offset discretionary spending and direct spending. The House and Senate passed different versions with varying amounts of offsets to reduce the proposed spending and impact on the federal deficit. In the third version of the bill, H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset the $81.8 billion in proposed spending. Congressional rules require spending to fit within totals set for discretionary and mandatory spending in the annual budget resolution, unless designated as emergencies. Almost all discretionary spending in the final version of H.R. 4899 was designated as emergency, not counting against budget caps. If caps are exceeded, spending could be subject to a point of order. In the final version of H.R. 4899, almost all discretionary spending was designated as emergency, not counting against budget caps. The President's supplemental request included $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending. These requests were submitted as part of the FY2011 budget. The President's supplemental request included $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending, submitted as part of the FY2011 budget. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as undermining budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on discretionary spending. In the current fiscal environment, some Members are concerned about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress debates whether to increase spending above appropriated levels and whether to offset the spending by cutting federal. Congress may debate increasing spending above appropriated levels and decide whether to offset the additional spending by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. This decision is made within budget rules and procedures, such as the FY2010 budget resolution and congressional pay-as-you-go rules. Congress considered the FY2010 supplemental appropriations request within budget constraints set by the FY2010 budget resolution and other rules. Spending could be exempted by designating it as an emergency or for overseas deployments. Waivers could also be granted for applicable points of order during consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure. During consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure, applicable points of order could be waived. An emergency designation could exempt spending from budget rules, but could itself be subject to a point of order. Waivers for this point of order may be granted in both the House and Senate. Various agencies and plaintiffs have cited deadlines for the needed supplemental funding from late March to late July 2010. Various agencies and plaintiffs have cited deadlines for the needed supplemental funding from late March to late July 2010. The Coast Guard, Defense Department, State Department, FEMA, and plaintiffs in the Cobell and Pigford II cases have all emphasized the urgency of the funding. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. They warned that the current pace of operations would deplete the Emergency Fund. The Administration urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Concerns were raised that the current pace of operations would deplete the Emergency Fund, leading to a potential funding shortfall by June 18, 2010. In response, the House and Senate passed legislation to raise the annual cap on funds that can be drawn from the trust fund. The Coast Guard could not use other funding sources for oil spill response activities, so additional funds from the trust fund were not available until October 1, 2010. The House and Senate passed legislation to raise the cap on funds from the trust fund to $1 billion specifically for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. The Department of Defense (DOD) received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010, with 80% of its total funding included in regular appropriations acts. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that an additional $33 billion was needed for troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover both base activities and war operations through August 2010 based on current obligations. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover base activities and war operations through August 2010.

The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. Secretary of Defense Gates urged passage of an additional $33 billion for troops deploying to Afghanistan by July 4 recess to avoid disruptions in programs. Concerns were raised about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding, with warnings that the Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August, leading to potential furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military. The Department of Defense received bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. Concerns were raised about potential furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military due to possible funding shortages in August. The Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding, but reprogramming requests could extend their funds through mid-August. Each service had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts, with the Army having $15.3 billion available. The services had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts: $1.2 billion for the Marine Corps, $1.5 billion for the Navy, $15.3 billion for the Army, and $2.2 billion for the Air Force. Monthly spending was expected to increase by 20% from April 2010 levels as additional troops arrived in theater. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, using base budget funding to temporarily finance war funding. The services used base budget funding to temporarily finance war funding, allowing them to last through July and into August. FEMA limited fund releases for disaster relief to extend funding, but estimated insolvency by the end of June with average monthly spending of $350 million. In May 2010, FEMA estimated potential insolvency of the Disaster Relief Fund by the end of June due to limited fund releases and delayed reimbursements. However, as of June 7, 2010, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the DRF, which could last through August 2010 if spending continued at the normal rate of $350 million per month. This was achieved by prioritizing immediate needs and life-threatening situations for funding. FEMA had a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment for infrastructure and mitigation projects that did not meet the immediate needs criteria. The State Department needed its disaster assistance funding replenished by June 1, 2010, to respond to future humanitarian crises. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation by mid-April 2010 to settle the Pigford II court case. The State Department required replenishment of disaster assistance funding by June 1, 2010, to address future humanitarian crises. Congress did not approve the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline for the Pigford II court case settlement. The final deadline for Congress to approve the Cobell suit settlement is August 6, 2010. The final deadline for Congress to approve the settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for individual American Indians is August 6, 2010. Key issues raised by Members of Congress include setting a timeline for evaluating continued spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring corruption in Haiti relief and reconstruction funding, and determining if additional domestic spending should be considered emergency spending or offset with rescissions of prior funds. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) due to anticipated fund depletion for disaster needs and unanticipated claims. FEMA stated that DRF spending averages $350 million monthly with a current balance of $600 million. FEMA anticipated the Disaster Relief Fund would run out of funds for disaster needs and unanticipated claims. To address the shortage, FEMA reduced expenditures by limiting payments and delaying some projects. Representative James Oberstar mentioned FEMA's actions to stretch available funds in a hearing. FEMA addressed the shortage in the Disaster Relief Fund by limiting payments to immediate needs and delaying other projects. Congress raised questions about FEMA's budgeting practices and delays in requesting additional funds. Members did not raise concerns about the limited information provided by FEMA regarding the fund's status. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices in FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. Congress provided $1.6 billion in FY2010, $400 million below the request, and $1.9 billion is requested for FY2011. The rationale for the request and current moratorium were discussed. The Obama Administration criticized previous unrealistic budgeting practices in FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. In FY2010, Congress provided $1.6 billion, $400 million below the request, and $1.9 billion is requested for FY2011. The rationale for the request and current moratorium were discussed, citing the need for additional funding due to a high number of disasters in recent years. Higher levels of funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) may be necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Congress may need to consider funding the DRF at a higher level to avoid the need for supplemental funding in the future. FEMA provided limited information for Congress to evaluate its request for additional arbitration rulings. Congress may need to consider higher funding levels for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. FEMA provided limited information for Congress to evaluate its request for additional arbitration rulings, with the only example cited being $475 million awarded to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's DRF, as previous House and Senate versions did. FEMA could strengthen its case for DRF supplementation by providing more information on how the fund has been used for past disasters and pending arbitration cases. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $396 million allocated for various disaster relief efforts. FEMA could enhance its case for DRF supplementation by providing more details on past fund usage and pending arbitration cases. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $396 million for disaster relief funding for floods in Tennessee and Rhode Island, fishery disasters in Alaska, tornado damages in the Midwest, and recovery projects related to Gulf Coast hurricanes. The committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to be $1 billion to $2 billion short of previous disaster relief needs, including Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, H.R. 4899 included $100 million for community development funds for long-term recovery and infrastructure repair. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 included $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and additional funding for disaster-relief activities in other agencies. This funding includes $100 million for community development funds for long-term recovery, $227 million for the Army Corps of Engineers for repair projects, $49 million for the Commerce Department's economic development assistance program, and $18 million for the Agriculture Department's emergency forest restoration program. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $10 million for drought relief and specified a federal cost share of no less than 90% for flood recovery in Rhode Island and Tennessee. FEMA was directed to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood map updates. The DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests focused on deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan and providing economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan as part of the counterinsurgency strategy. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to address the deteriorating security situation and target the insurgency. By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remainder of the scheduled increase expected by September 2010. This would bring the total number of deployed troops to 98,000, tripling the initial deployment number. As of June 1, nearly 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remaining 4,000 of the 30,000 scheduled increase expected by September 2010. This would bring the total deployed troops to 98,000, tripling the number from October 2008. Troop levels increased under both the Bush and Obama administrations in response to security concerns. The security situation in Afghanistan led to troop levels increasing to 98,000 by November 2009, with plans for a further increase to 148,000 by fall. NATO allies also increased troop levels to 48,000 by March 2010. The total number of foreign and Afghan forces is expected to reach 389,000, with additional support troops and funding allocated for this deployment. In 2010, the total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan is expected to reach 148,000, with plans for Afghan security forces to total 243,000. The Defense Department requested $33 billion, including $30 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, $1 billion for training Iraq Security Forces, and $2 billion for fuel costs. Total war spending in FY2010 is projected to be $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. This is a $12 billion increase from FY2009 and almost the same as the FY2011 request. The total war spending in FY2010 is projected to be $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The FY2010 Supplemental increased DOD appropriations for the Afghan War to $314.1 billion, with a potential rise to $427.7 billion if the FY2011 request is approved. In comparison, the total enacted for Iraq is $705 billion, increasing to $706.2 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental and potentially reaching $752 billion with the FY2011 request. These figures exclude war funding for State/USAID and VA Medical. The FY2010 Supplemental increased DOD appropriations for the Afghan War to $314.1 billion, potentially rising to $427.7 billion with the FY2011 request. President Obama's new strategy in Afghanistan included a timeline for evaluating its effectiveness, with a planned U.S. drawdown in July 2011. However, Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen cautioned that the timeline could slip. The U.S. plans to begin withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in July 2011, but there are concerns about potential delays and the extent of the drawdown. Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen emphasized that the July 2011 date marks the start of a transition, not the complete withdrawal, based on conditions on the ground. General Petraeus described the initiative as an 18-month campaign, with an evaluation scheduled for September 2011. Members of Congress raised concerns about the timing of the evaluation, the duration of the campaign, and the long-term U.S. military involvement. Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, described the initiative as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Congress debated amendments to increase their role in decision-making on U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, with Amendment No. 3 and No. 4 being defeated. Amendment No. 3 and No. 4, which aimed to cut off funding for Afghanistan and limit DOD funding to troop withdrawal, were defeated. Amendment No. 5 required a new plan for troop redeployment by April 4, 2010, and if not consistent with withdrawal after July 1, 2011, Congress would need to approve fund expenditure. Concerns about Afghanistan escalated after the operation in Marjah, Helmand Province. Concerns about Afghanistan have risen since the operation in Marjah, Helmand Province, with the next key test being the campaign for Kandahar. Of the $33 billion in DOD's supplemental request, $30 billion was allocated for Afghanistan, $1 billion for training Iraqi Security Forces, and $2 billion for higher fuel prices in DOD's base budget. The DOD's supplemental request of $33 billion was delayed from its planned summer date, with $30 billion allocated for Afghanistan, $1 billion for training Iraqi Security Forces, and $2 billion for higher fuel prices. The funding for Afghanistan included various expenses such as operations, force protection, training of Afghan security forces, fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers have suggested the average cost for deploying 30,000 more troops. The DOD's regular budget includes funding for fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers suggest the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops would average $1 million per troop. Functional categories were developed by DOD to describe its request, ranging from \"Operations\" to Coalition Support Funds for Pakistan's counter-terror operations. The DOD developed functional categories to describe its funding request, including \"Operations\" and Coalition Support Funds for Pakistan. Funding for the Afghan war between FY2009 and FY2011 varied across categories, with Operations expected to increase with troop levels. DOD's estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan differ from CBO's estimates, and spending may increase later in the fiscal year. DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan differ from CBO's estimates, with a per troop cost of $875,000 compared to CBO's $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same average monthly troop strength, reflecting gradual deployment over the fiscal year. DOD's reported obligations suggest that their estimates may be high unless spending increases substantially later in the year. Operations costs in the FY2010 supplemental request are expected to be high due to new troop deployments to southern Afghanistan. The DOD's estimate for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan is $875,000 per troop, higher than CBO's $467,000 estimate. DOD attributes the high costs to setting up facilities in southern Afghanistan where troop presence is limited. In 2009, concerns about accurate budgeting led to $5 billion being transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. In 2009, $5 billion was transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund due to concerns about accurate budgeting for the Afghan and Iraq wars. DOD's estimates for FY2010 may be high as obligations reported in the first five months are only 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to double to utilize all funds, indicating that DOD's estimates may be inflated. The DOD's reported obligations for operational costs in the first five months of FY2010 are only 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to double to utilize all funds, suggesting that DOD's estimates may be inflated. An additional $2.6 billion was approved to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, raising total FY2010 ASFF funding to $9.2 billion. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total FY2010 ASFF funding to $9.2 billion. Concerns were raised about the need for all the additional funds, the achievability of DOD's plan, and oversight issues. The plan aimed to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011, with the Afghan Army growing to 171,000 and the Afghan Police to 134,000 by October 2011. Security forces were planned to reach 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011. The Afghan Army was set to grow to 171,000 by October 2011, and the Afghan Police to 134,000. NATO partners endorsed these increases, and the DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for these efforts. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army, pay soldiers more, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total through FY2011 to $39.8 billion. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but General Mullen sees this as an aspirational goal for the future. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but General Mullen characterized this as an aspirational goal for the future. The training of Afghan Security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors, with DOD and the State Department facing various challenges in the process. The training of Afghan security forces, conducted by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors, has faced numerous challenges. These include high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, logistical limitations, and issues with illiteracy, corruption, and insurgent attacks on police recruits. Coordination problems between DOD, State Department, and NATO training efforts, as well as issues with private contractors' performance and behavior, have been persistent obstacles. The spring of 2010 report on Afghan police training highlighted coordination issues between DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition training efforts, problems with private contractors including poor performance and behavior, shortages of contractor personnel, and lack of contract oversight. Despite additional trainers sent by DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, shortages persist, raising concerns about reliance on contractors. Senator Levin expressed worries about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police. Despite additional trainers sent by DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, shortages persist, raising concerns about reliance on contractors. Senator Levin cited a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010, Afghan Section 1230 Metrics report. Members may want to know how many trainers are needed for initial and follow-on training in Afghanistan and how this requirement will be met in terms of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractor personnel. The FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan raises questions about the number of trainers needed and how to meet the requirement with U.S. military personnel, coalition partners, and contractors. Shortfalls in trainers could hinder the ramp-up of training for Afghan police. A bid-protest may have delayed contract awards, but a provision allows the Secretary of State to rely on previous contracts. The FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan raises questions about the number of trainers needed and how to meet the requirement with U.S. military personnel, coalition partners, and contractors. Afghan police training could have been delayed due to a bid-protest, but Congress allowed the Secretary of State to use a previously awarded contract. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010, with plans for a full and open competition that could potentially reduce funding needed in FY2010. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010, with concerns raised about the justification for emergency supplementals for war spending. Some argue that war spending should be included in regular appropriations acts. The FY2010 war funding request was enacted as Title IX in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act. Some argue that certain parts of the request, like funding for training and equipment, may not be directly related to new troop deployments and should be considered as part of regular DOD appropriations. Some of DOD's request, including $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF), $2 billion to offset fuel increases, and $1.7 billion for reset or replacement of war-worn equipment, may not be directly related to new troop deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices. The emergency designation of these funds could be challenged. The $1 billion for the ISFF is necessary for Iraq's security amidst lower oil prices. DOD's request for $2 billion to cover fuel costs could be funded from existing resources. The $1.7 billion for equipment reset is loosely tied to troop increase. The DOD is requesting an infusion of budget authority for additional troops and $1.7 billion for equipment reset to replace war-worn equipment. Some argue that predicting the need for equipment replacement due to the gradual deployment of troops is difficult, while others believe it can be estimated based on past experience. The DOD has a substantial backlog of war-related procurement that remains to be spent. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. This includes adjustments in particular accounts for funding in excess of requirements, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. This included adjustments such as a $400 million cut rejecting a DOD proposal to fund two Army force protection programs and a $512 million increase to procurement accounts for additional combat losses. Both the House and Senate versions approved the amounts requested to train Afghan and Iraq security forces. The Senate version of H.R. 4899, enacted by the House, approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. It also included assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees but removed a provision for base closure transportation improvements. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for Afghanistan. This would bring the total FY2010 military construction budget to $1.9 billion. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, with $521 million allocated for Afghanistan. This would double the FY2009 level for war-related construction, raising concerns about the purpose of the facilities being built in Afghanistan. Congress allowed for a \"long-term presence\" but not \"permanent stationing\" of troops in Afghanistan. It is unclear how urgently the funds are needed given current spending rates. The $521 million military construction request for Afghanistan aims to create infrastructure to support 30,000 additional U.S. troops, focusing on roads, runways, quarters, and other facilities. The justification emphasizes expanding airfield and logistics capacity for increased airlift and combat operations. The request is split evenly between Army and Air Force projects, with a focus on southern provinces. The $521 million military construction request for Afghanistan aims to expand airfield capacity for increased airlift and combat operations, focusing on southern provinces like Helmand, Nimruz, and Kandahar. Army and Air Force projects include waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, and gravel roads. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include expanding airfield capacity in southern provinces like Helmand, Nimruz, and Kandahar. Army construction involves waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command and control headquarters at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tombstone near Lashkar Gah. Air Force construction includes runways, aprons, and facilities at various bases across the country. The military construction projects in Afghanistan involve expanding airfield capacity in various provinces. Congress is concerned about the long-term implications of this spending on construction, questioning if it signifies a permanent U.S. troop presence in the country. In Afghanistan, Congress has taken steps to prevent the establishment of permanent military bases by banning the use of defense funds for that purpose. This is similar to measures taken in Iraq to distinguish between short-term warfighting support and permanent troop stationing. The United States Government is prohibited from using funds to establish permanent military bases in Afghanistan, with an exception allowing for long-term presence support using Operation & Maintenance funds. Congress has allowed the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for military construction supporting a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan, despite the ban on permanent military bases. The distinction between projects for permanent stationing and long-term presence is unclear, leading to occasional denial of funds for projects hinting at permanency. Some projects in supplemental appropriations requests for military construction in Afghanistan have been denied funds due to concerns about signaling a permanent presence. The Department of Defense has been granted flexibility to use Operation & Maintenance funds for urgent military operational requirements of a temporary nature since FY2004. Congress renewed this authority annually until FY2009. The Department of Defense has been granted flexibility to use Operation & Maintenance funds for urgent military operational requirements of a temporary nature since FY2004. Congress renewed this authority annually until FY2009, with a cap between $100 million and $200 million. In 2009, Congress permitted DOD to use $200 million for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan. The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan is expected to continue for several years, even after military operations end. Congress authorized the Department of Defense to use $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements. This funding for military construction significantly increases the amount spent on such projects. The Department of Defense was authorized to use O&M funding for military construction, with a $500 million limit on projects in Central Command. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, raising the total to $1.4 billion. This nearly equaled the entire amount spent on construction in Afghanistan between FY2003 and FY2008. If DOD dedicated the full $500 million in O&M for military construction in Afghanistan in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion, almost doubling the prior seven-year investment. In FY2003 and FY2008, DOD doubled construction investment in Afghanistan, reaching $2.4 billion in FY2010. DOD also proposed using O&M funds for minor construction until 2012. Key bases like Bagram Air Base received $1.3 billion, with $248 million requested for a total of $1.6 billion. Kandahar Air Base had $767 million appropriated. DOD has invested significant amounts in key bases in Afghanistan, including $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base, $767 million in Kandahar Air Base, and $595 million in Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. Additionally, DOD has requested new language for FY2011 authorization to use O&M funds for minor military construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. The DOD has requested new language for the FY2011 DOD authorization to use O&M funds for unspecified minor military construction projects of up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This proposal would allow DOD to draw on O&M funds without a limit for military construction projects worldwide, with a raised per project cap from $750,000 to $3 million. The DOD proposed increasing the per project cap for minor construction projects to $3 million due to rising costs in Afghanistan. This would allow unlimited O&M funds for military construction worldwide in support of contingency operations. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be done after-the-fact within 60 days. Questions arose about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given DOD's current spending rates in Afghanistan. The DOD requested to use O&M funds for Central Command projects, raising questions about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request. DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority from previous acts, with spending rates in Afghanistan averaging $50 million a month in FY2009 but dropping to $26 million a month in FY2010. To obligate all funds by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority from previous acts, with spending rates in Afghanistan averaging $50 million a month in FY2009 but dropping to $26 million a month in FY2010. To obligate all funds by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. To spend all FY2009 monies before they lapse, DOD needs to increase monthly obligations four-fold to $100 million. For FY2010 projects, obligations would need to average $116 million monthly. With supplemental funds, obligations would have to triple to $150 million a month. The FY2010 supplemental request could be part of DOD's FY2011 war request. Total funding for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899 was $657 million. The FY2010 supplemental request could be considered as part of DOD's FY2011 war request. Total funding for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan. The final military construction funding was $127.5 million above the request to accelerate projects funded by the Air Force using O&M monies for contingency-related projects. The final military construction funding was $127.5 million above the request to accelerate projects funded by the Air Force using O&M monies for contingency-related projects. The Senate report emphasized the need for known contingency construction requirements to be included in the budget request. The funds would be available for two years instead of the requested four years. The bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The final military construction funding was $127.5 million above the request, with funds available for two years instead of four. The bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan was $4.46 billion. This included $1.8 billion for State Department personnel and infrastructure, and $2.6 billion for foreign aid to support U.S. security efforts. The international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan was $4.46 billion. This included $1.8 billion for State Department personnel and infrastructure, and $2.6 billion for foreign aid to support U.S. security efforts. The Administration requested funding in discrete sub-accounts for each country, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival accounts. If approved, the total funding for the three countries would increase by more than two-thirds from FY2009 to FY2010. The enacted version raised the total level to about $9.2 billion, a 55% increase. The FY2010 supplemental budget for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations was enacted at $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over the FY2009 appropriation. This amount was $714 million less than the Administration's request. The funding for Afghanistan emphasized civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services in conjunction with U.S. military efforts. The FY2010 supplemental budget for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations was enacted at $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over the FY2009 appropriation. The funding for Afghanistan emphasized civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services provided in conjunction with U.S. military efforts. The strategy aimed to rapidly increase stability and reduce the strength of the insurgency in problematic provinces. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy aimed to accelerate civilian assistance delivery in insurgent areas contested by the U.S. military. The strategy focused on creating jobs, providing social services, and increasing stability in problematic provinces through the Afghan government. Key concerns include leadership and support from the Afghan government, coordination between military and civilian aid programs, and levels of corruption hindering progress. The Afghan government's ability to provide leadership and support to local communities in conflict areas, coordination between U.S. military and civilian aid programs, and concerns about corruption hindering effective service delivery are key issues. The U.S. government is worried about monitoring aid accountability and increasing personnel to address corruption in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding levels for the country. The increase in U.S. aid personnel and request for inspector general offices reflects concerns about corruption in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost international affairs funding levels for the country, with significant increases in aid and State support. The FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account would rise by nearly 90% under the request. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increased the diplomatic operations account by 86%. Foreign aid in the supplemental request would raise civilian aid accounts for Afghanistan by 67%. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increased total FY2010 diplomatic operations account by 86%, with foreign aid portion raising civilian aid accounts for Afghanistan by 67%. The Administration sought $1.6 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) and $200 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding, along with $211 million in Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) funds. ESF is a main source of economic, political, and social aid. The request includes $1.6 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for various aid programs in Afghanistan, such as alternative development, conflict mitigation, rule of law, and good governance. ESF is a key source of economic, political, and social aid channeled through USAID. The request includes $1.6 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for aid programs in Afghanistan, including projects in local communities, rule of law, good governance, health, education, macroeconomic growth, trade and investment, financial sector, and agriculture. The Ministry of Finance aims to improve revenue collection through tax administration reform. Trade and investment receive $19.5 million for trade agreements and infrastructure. The financial sector gets $4.5 million for Central Bank branches. Agriculture receives $215 million for capacity building and support services. Private sector development is allocated $60.4 million, while economic opportunity receives $8.6 million for credit union services. The INCLE account, implemented by the State Department, focuses on justice sector support and counter-narcotics programs. $8.6 million allocated for expanding credit union services, including Islamic-compliant financing, as part of the INCLE account implemented by the State Department. The funding request includes support for the justice sector, rule of law activities, corrections program expansion, model prisons, increasing judges and prosecutors, counternarcotics programs, legal aid, women's justice activities, counternarcotics police, drug treatment facilities, and support for children. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) request of $211 million included funding for various initiatives such as the Anti-Corruption Unit, legal aid, women's justice activities, counternarcotics police, and drug treatment facilities. The request also aimed to increase civilian personnel by 457 positions to work at the district level and with Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). The FY2010 State Department D&CP request included funding for 764 positions at a cost of $211 million. This involved hiring U.S. direct hires, staff for Kabul ministries and PRTs, and locally employed staff. The \"whole of government\" approach utilized federal employees from various agencies to provide specialized expertise. The Department of State Inspector General's report praised management at the U.S. embassy in Kabul but noted concerns about overwork. The Department proposed hiring 200 locally employed staff to support American personnel in Kabul. A report praised embassy management but expressed concerns about overwork due to staff tripling. The rapid expansion would strain resources, impacting staff management, housing, and security needs. Additional funding was requested for SIGAR and the State Department. The supplemental request for Afghanistan assistance included funding for staff housing and office space in Kabul, as well as additional funding for oversight agencies. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, lower than the $2.0 billion request. Major differences exist between the enacted version and the Administration's request. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, lower than the $2.0 billion request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends specific funding levels for various program sectors within the ESF account, cutting good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. The Senate report expresses concerns about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan and recommends assessments of its effectiveness. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, with notable cuts to good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. The Senate report raises concerns about providing aid directly to the Afghan government and limits direct government budget support to $100 million. Additionally, the enacted version addresses oversight issues and rejects the request for SIGAR due to available funding from previous appropriations. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, with cuts to good governance and alternative development activities. It rejects the request for SIGAR due to available funding from previous appropriations and includes conditions on aid, such as consultation with Afghan government representatives and civil society, specific benchmarks for progress, and limitations on aid availability. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocates $1.7 billion for Afghanistan aid, with conditions on consultation with Afghan officials and civil society, specific progress benchmarks, and restrictions on aid availability. Aid is contingent on Afghan government cooperation in reform, respect for women's rights, and removal of corrupt officials. Support for the Electoral Commission is subject to no involvement in fraud, and aid for reconciliation with Taliban members requires Afghan women's participation. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million in funding for activities supporting U.S. civilian security in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. Funds for the Electoral Commission are contingent on no involvement in fraud, and aid for reconciliation with Taliban members requires Afghan women's participation. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 authorizes up to $300 million in funding for U.S. civilian security in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. This funding reflects the new strategic environment in Iraq post U.S. military drawdown, leading to a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations. Total economic aid programs for Iraq have seen a substantial boost, with a 89% increase over the previous year. The FY2010 U.S. assistance program to Iraq saw a 64% increase from FY2009 levels under the enacted version of H.R. 4899, with total economic aid programs for Iraq rising by 89%. The State operations account alone increased by 79%, while total FY2010 State operations rose by 43% over FY2009 levels. The supplemental for Iraq included a request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of responsibility for police training from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. The FY2010 U.S. assistance program to Iraq included a request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of responsibility for police training from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. This transition is effective October 1, 2011, with the State Department taking on the role of advising the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces in Iraq. The INCLE request also involved deploying 350 advisors to work at various locations throughout the country and funding infrastructure construction and security staff to support expert personnel.

The supplemental request included $1.57 billion for State Department operational costs in Iraq to maintain civilian outreach following the military drawdown. The United States has over 1,200 civilian federal employees in Iraq conducting missions in various locations. During the 2007 surge, embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established to allow civilian presence in additional locations protected by combat battalions. Civilian federal employees conduct various missions including diplomatic work, economic and commercial interests, political analysis, public diplomacy, oversight of government assistance programs, reconstruction efforts, rule of law programs, and training with Iraqi ministry and local government personnel. As combat battalions withdraw from cities, embedded PRTs are being phased out. The embedded PRTs were established during the 2007 surge to support civilian presence in locations protected by combat battalions. They assist in various missions such as diplomatic work, economic assistance, reconstruction efforts, and training with Iraqi government personnel. As combat battalions withdraw, the embedded PRTs are being phased out, with regular PRTs expected to be terminated by 2011. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to maintain a civilian presence outside of Baghdad. Additional funding is allocated for realigning infrastructure to support the transition. The supplemental funding request includes realigning infrastructure for the transition to an Embassy, two consulates, three State managed PDTs, and two interim Defense Department PRTs. The State Department will assume costs previously borne by the military, such as utilities, housing, and equipment. Funding will also go towards constructing planned consulate facilities to meet security standards and phasing in security requirements for new field facilities. The State Department will assume costs previously borne by the military for infrastructure realignment, consulate facility construction, and security requirements for new field facilities. This includes providing contract employees for various services such as security, operations planning, maintenance, and food preparation. The State Department will increase contract employees to provide various services in Iraq, but concerns remain about its capabilities in contract management. H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than requested. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, cutting the request for diplomatic operations by $540 million. It also increases the amount requested for INCLE by $133 million and reconfigures the use of the funds. The Senate appropriators suggested prioritizing facilities in the country within regular appropriations bills. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases the INCLE funding by $133 million, reconfiguring the use of funds for police training. The Pakistan supplemental request did not show a significant change in U.S. policy. There would only be a modest shift in funding for Pakistan when considering all funding sources, including DOD aid. The Pakistan supplemental request for FY2010 aimed at specific infrastructure needs to show continued U.S. support and government capability in vulnerable areas. The largest portion of the request was $244 million in ESF, including $50 million for cash payments. The U.S. government provided $244 million in ESF to support Pakistan's infrastructure needs, including cash payments for displaced people, water and sanitation projects, agriculture irrigation systems, and solutions for the energy crisis. Additionally, $40 million in INCLE funds were allocated for police training and related infrastructure. The U.S. government allocated $64 million for solutions to Pakistan's energy crisis, $40 million for police training and related infrastructure, and $60 million for military assistance including helicopters. Additionally, $26 million was requested for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan. The Administration requested $26 million in FY2010 for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan by 56 positions. This includes U.S. direct-hire personnel and Locally Employed Staff (LES) to manage increased military and economic assistance. The staffing increase aims to provide more contracting and management officers, enhance logistical support, and strengthen staffing at U.S. consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar. The Administration requested increased staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan to accommodate the growth of U.S. government civilian personnel. H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, including funds for housing, general service, and financial officers. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, including funding for human rights and assistance for families affected by military operations.

The enacted legislation includes $1.5 million in ESF for leasing aircraft to monitor programs in Pakistan. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. About 55% of the funds are for Haiti's urgent needs. The proposed funds are emergency requirements for urgent and essential needs in Haiti, available until September 30, 2012. The request covers reimbursement of past obligations and new activities by U.S. agencies. Approximately 55% is for earthquake relief, 40% for recovery and reconstruction, and 6% for diplomatic operations. The Haiti earthquake was one of the most devastating catastrophes, affecting 3 million people with 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The Haiti earthquake was a devastating catastrophe, affecting 3 million people with 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. Approximately 2 million people were displaced, with the relief effort expected to last for months. Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries, facing a high risk of poverty. Protection of the displaced population is a critical issue, with up to 1.69 million displaced in Port-au-Prince. The displaced population in Haiti, estimated at 1.69 million in Port-au-Prince, is facing challenges in accessing basic services and shelter. Some have relocated to areas outside the capital, which were already poverty-stricken. Aid workers are providing necessities to Internally Displaced Populations, but emergency shelter is scarce, especially with the rainy season approaching. Some Haitians have also left the country as refugees to neighboring countries like the Dominican Republic and the United States. In Haiti, aid workers are delivering basic necessities to areas with Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs), but emergency shelter is scarce as the rainy season approaches. The total value of recovery and reconstruction needs in Haiti is $11.5 billion, with international donors pledging nearly $10 billion for long-term reconstruction efforts. The U.S. has pledged $1.2 billion towards this cause. Assessment conducted by Haiti and international institutions found that the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs in Haiti is $11.5 billion. At a donors conference, 48 countries pledged nearly $10 billion for reconstruction efforts. The U.S. pledged $1.2 billion towards this cause. There is a call for improved accountability of donor assistance to Haiti to reduce corruption. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development is ensuring further transparency. The government of Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development has helped establish an online monitoring system for aid. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than requested. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than requested. This total funding covers relief activities, recovery and reconstruction, and diplomatic operations. The Administration had requested $1.5 billion for relief and disaster assistance funding for Haiti, which included funding for USAID International Disaster Assistance, Agriculture Department emergency food assistance, and State Department. The U.S. government requested $1.5 billion for humanitarian relief funding for Haiti, which included funds for various agencies such as USAID, Agriculture Department, State Department, Department of Defense, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Homeland Security. President Obama also announced an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance. The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance (IDA) to provide earthquake relief to Haiti, with $126.6 million allocated to USAID. As of June 11, 2010, the United States had provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti. The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance (IDA) to provide earthquake relief to Haiti, with $126.6 million allocated to USAID. The funding covered various support services and ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Haiti. The United States, in collaboration with various organizations, provided assistance to Haiti through different clusters focusing on humanitarian coordination, logistics, shelter, health, water, sanitation, and child protection programs. Additionally, $150 million was allocated for emergency food assistance, with $68 million designated for the World Food Program. The United States allocated $18 million for water, sanitation, and hygiene programs, $5.4 million for child protection programs, and $150 million for emergency food assistance in Haiti. The food assistance includes 55,000 metric tons for the World Food Program and funding for Private Voluntary Organizations. Up to two million people may need food aid due to the earthquake, with relief operations expected to continue through 2010. Recovery efforts will focus on the most vulnerable and food-for-work programs. In Haiti, food needs will decrease, and food activities will target the most vulnerable through food-for-work programs. Relief operations will continue through 2010, with a focus on recovery and reconstruction efforts addressing humanitarian concerns. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters in Haiti. The international community, led by the United Nations and the United States, has been actively involved in providing significant humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters in Haiti over the last decade, particularly hurricanes. Disaster risks in Haiti are high, and efforts to develop a disaster response capacity are crucial for sustaining reconstruction efforts in the future. The United States typically plays a leading role and is a major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters, with bipartisan congressional support for humanitarian assistance. In times of immediate emergency relief, the Administration may use disaster accounts intended for worldwide use to fund pledges. The United States is a major contributor to humanitarian relief efforts, with bipartisan support from Congress. Disaster accounts are being depleted to provide aid to Haiti, and resources need to be replenished by June 1, 2010 to respond to future crises. The current funding request would reimburse previous aid provided. The earthquake in Haiti has garnered global attention. The United States is a significant contributor to humanitarian relief efforts, with bipartisan support from Congress. Disaster accounts are being depleted to aid Haiti, and resources must be replenished by June 1, 2010, to address future emergencies. The relief funding in the current request would reimburse previous aid provided. The earthquake in Haiti has received worldwide attention and focus, with the United Nations issuing a Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti amounting to $1.44 billion. As of June 4, 2010, commitments of $874 million had been received, but it is unclear whether these figures represent pledges or specific obligations. It is uncertain if donor figures represent pledges or specific obligations. Government pledges may not translate to actual contributions, and funds committed may not be new. The distribution of costs for Haiti's disaster among international donors will become clearer over time. Sustaining donor interest in Haiti and honoring pledges may be challenging. Criticism has been directed at the slow delivery of humanitarian aid, while others argue against unfair criticism. Maintaining funding priorities for other disaster areas globally is also a concern. The international community faced challenges in delivering humanitarian assistance to Haiti after the earthquake due to slow response, damaged infrastructure, and logistical issues. Evaluations of the relief efforts continue to be debated, with concerns about bureaucratic red tape, the capacity of the Haitian government, and the role of the United States. The earthquake in Haiti caused delays and difficulties in the relief response. Concerns remain about bureaucratic red tape, the capacity of the Haitian government, and coordination issues among the international community. The DOD requested $655 million and the U.S. Coast Guard requested $45 million for humanitarian relief efforts. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested $700 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti after the earthquake. This funding covered soldier support, relief supplies, and projects. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested $700 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti after the earthquake, covering soldier support, relief supplies, and projects. DOD's response to the Haitian earthquake was rapid and extensive, with over 20,000 U.S. military personnel involved in various relief efforts. The mission ended on June 1, 2010, when the last 300 military personnel redeployed from Haiti. The DOD's earthquake response mission in Haiti ended on June 1, 2010, with the last 300 U.S. military personnel redeploying. Further assistance will be provided through the U.S. Southern Command-sponsored \"New Horizons\" exercise, involving National Guard and Reserve soldiers in engineering projects for schools, clinics, and community centers. The \"New Horizons\" exercise in Haiti, involving 500 National Guard and Reserve soldiers, will include engineering projects like building schools, clinics, and community centers. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima will provide medical assistance and perform surgeries in July. Concerns exist about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces and the capabilities of Haitian security forces and U.N. security personnel. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account to fund U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), a peacekeeping operation. The U.N. Security Council increased MINUSTAH levels by 3,500 after the earthquake, with military personnel growing from 6,940 to 8,940 and the police component growing from 2,211 to 3,711. The U.N.

Sections 4201-4206 of the House July amended version of H.R. 4899 form the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, aiming to stop pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act aims to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry, where brand-name drug companies compensate generic manufacturers to delay the entry of generic drugs into the market. This practice is targeted to ensure timely availability of generic versions after the patent period ends. The House-passed health reform package did not include provisions to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, leading to lower prices. Delays in generic availability increase costs for consumers and the government. The proposed provisions would make such agreements unlawful. The provisions in the House-passed health reform package aim to make pay-to-delay agreements in the pharmaceutical industry unlawful. This would reduce costs for consumers and the government by allowing generic drugs to enter the market sooner. The provisions would add a new section to the FTC Act, giving the FTC rulemaking authority and allowing for judicial review and civil penalties. Implementing these provisions is estimated to reduce federal spending by $2.42 billion and increase federal revenues by $0.26 billion over the 2010-2020 period. The House-passed health reform package aims to make pay-to-delay agreements in the pharmaceutical industry unlawful, reducing costs for consumers and the government. The provisions include new FTC Act sections for rulemaking authority and judicial review, with estimated savings of $2.42 billion in federal spending and $0.26 billion in increased revenues over 2010-2020. The Senate did not accept these provisions, and the enacted version did not include $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse initiatives. The House-passed health reform package aims to make pay-to-delay agreements in the pharmaceutical industry unlawful, reducing costs for consumers and the government. The provisions include new FTC Act sections for rulemaking authority and judicial review, with estimated savings of $2.42 billion in federal spending and $0.26 billion in increased revenues over 2010-2020. The $538 million in waste, fraud, and abuse (WFA) funding in the House July amended version was to go to various federal agencies for activities to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute individuals suspected of illegal activity. The $538 million in WFA funding in the House July amended version was allocated as follows: $245 million for enhanced tax enforcement by IRS; $250 million for the HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. Funds would be used for WFA activities for Medicare Advantage, Medicare drug benefits, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Additionally, funds would support HHS fraud and abuse investigations, continuing disability reviews for Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries, and eligibility redeterminations for Supplemental Security Income recipients. The Inspector General allocated $60 million to the Department of Justice for HHS fraud investigations, $38 million to SSA for disability reviews, and $5 million to DOL for reemployment reviews. The funds were not emergency designated and would be available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated a $538 million increase in the federal deficit in 2010 with no estimated savings, leading to increased deficits from 2010-2020. The additional PI funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010, with no estimated savings. The Coast Guard can draw up to $150 million per year from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities. A new unemployment assistance program is proposed for individuals not eligible for other benefits. The Administration proposed using the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance response activities and establish a new unemployment assistance program for those not eligible for other benefits. The fund allows the Coast Guard to withdraw up to $150 million annually and is supported by an excise tax on petroleum. Additionally, a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax was suggested to replenish the fund. The responsibility for reimbursing the U.S. Treasury for the costs of the new unemployment benefit program would fall on the parties responsible for the oil spill under the Oil Pollution Act. The Administration's proposal for a new unemployment benefit program would be funded by the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, with costs to be reimbursed by parties responsible for the oil spill under the Oil Pollution Act. The proposal includes mandatory appropriations as advances from the trust fund, with later withdrawals not requiring appropriations. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory appropriations, offset by $25 million to be recovered from responsible parties. The Administration's proposal includes $125 million in mandatory appropriations from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, with $150 million in spending offset by $25 million to be recovered from responsible parties. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances of $100 million each from the trust fund to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with a proposed increase in the total expenditure cap from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The Administration proposed increasing the cap on total expenditure for responding to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that $1.575 billion would be available in the trust fund by the end of FY2010. This increase in the limitation on annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would only apply to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, enhancing federal emergency response capabilities. The limitation on annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would apply exclusively to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to enhance federal emergency response capabilities. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress within 7 days of any advanced funds for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, while other spills would still require 30 days notice. This aligns with legislation passed separately in response to concerns raised by Admiral Thad Allen and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. The legislation, P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473), raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill and allowed $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010 offset by reimbursements in FY2012. The actual amount available to the Coast Guard would depend on the number of $100 million advances drawn from the trust fund, up to the $1 billion cap.
