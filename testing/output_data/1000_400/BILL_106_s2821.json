    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\". It addresses the creditability of service. The \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\" amends Section 8411(b) of title 5, United States Code to include service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation performed between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, of at least 1 year's duration, if the individual later becomes subject to this chapter. The amendment requires employees or Members to deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for service performed as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, if they later become subject to this chapter. Employees or Members must deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for service performed as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000. If the deposit is made more than 5 years later, interest will be added annually. The deposit is due and must include interest, compounded annually after 5 years. If the full deposit is not made, service is still creditable but annuity may be reduced. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERSONS WHO HAVE SEPARATED. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for obtaining credit for service performed by individuals who have separated from Government service. Credit will only be given upon submission of a written application by December 31, 2001. Any annuity or survivor annuity will be recomputed to include the service described in the regulations. The annuity will be recomputed to include service described in regulations, with a reduction if deposit is not made timely. Interest is not included in the deposit. The Office of Personnel Management is required to notify individuals of their rights under the Act and assist them in obtaining necessary information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
