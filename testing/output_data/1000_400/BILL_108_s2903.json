    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are crucial for youth development, promoting leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Nonprofit organizations strive to prioritize the well-being of young athletes despite the inherent risks of injuries. Young people benefit from participating in school sports and amateur competitions by having lower obesity levels, becoming fitter adults with fewer health problems, and having the opportunity to compete at appropriate skill levels. Despite the inherent risks and physical intensity of sports, rules are necessary to ensure the greater good of amateur athletics. Rules in amateur sports are essential for young people to compete at appropriate levels. Despite the inherent risks in sports, rules must be clear and not subject to lawsuits based on good faith development. Rules makers in amateur sports are increasingly facing lawsuits for negligence in developing or adopting rules. Defending these claims can hinder their ability to provide services and discourage top coaches, officials, and administrators from participating in rules committees.
