The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies. Federal use of probabilistic methods lags behind industry, but they offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly regulations. Incorporating probabilistic methods in federally funded design efforts could enhance product specifications. Probabilistic methods, if properly applied, can lead to more business-friendly regulations and reduce overdesign and associated costs. Integrating these methods in federally funded design efforts could improve understanding of product specifications and lead to more reliable and less costly components in transportation systems. This could benefit various federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve regulations and reduce costs in transportation systems. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify ways to help the Department of Transportation, assess how these methods can improve ROI and public safety, evaluate technology, recommend techniques for practical use, establish models for quantifying uncertainties, identify key technology areas for development, and recommend implementation guidelines. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing probabilistic technology, setting reliability levels for public safety, safety tests, creating databases, expediting technology transfer, and ensuring appropriate use of probabilistic methods in Department of Transportation decisions. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for creating required databases, expediting technology transfer, identifying legal and cultural barriers, making recommendations for program use, institutionalizing values, and recommending pilot projects for evaluation. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from various sectors. Members serve for life and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members serve without pay but receive travel expenses.
