The Congress finds that the earthquake and tsunami in 2004 caused significant casualties in Southeast Asia. There is a potential seismic threat along the west coast of the United States, with a predicted 10 to 15 percent chance of a major event in the next 50 years. This event could lead to a devastating earthquake and tsunami, highlighting the lack of preparedness in coastal communities. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program's primary goal is to assist departments in tsunami hazard preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially those lacking necessary resources. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to certain areas for tsunami preparedness. Priority is given to areas with a 10 percent or greater likelihood of a tsunami in the next 50 years. Grants are awarded based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency service providers. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for residents. The grant funds can be used for various purposes including police and fire stations, emergency management facilities, hospitals, shelters, sewer sanitation systems, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for educating residents and tourists on tsunami preparedness. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. Emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes are required to provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for grants under this Act. The percentages vary based on the population size: over 50,000 (20%), between 20,001 and 50,000 (10%), and under 20,000 (5%). To be eligible for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments serving areas with a population under 20,000 must contribute 5% of the total project cost with non-Federal funds. In-kind contributions can also be considered, not exceeding 50% of the department's non-Federal contribution. The Director will evaluate if emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and assess program effectiveness within 180 days of grant awards. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation completion. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" refers to an agency responsible for planning, preparing, and managing emergencies or disasters. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various territories. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $100,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2007-2012 for Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program under DHS. Director may reserve 5% for administrative costs. Funds available until expended."
