    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid rise in retail drug spending. Factors contributing to this increase include the introduction of new drugs at higher prices, fewer generic substitutes due to patent protection, and a forecasted 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending. This report will address common questions about government and private-sector policies. The CMS forecasts a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026, which is expected to outpace other areas of medical spending. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. It also references NHE accounts for data on prescription drug spending. The report provides an overview of issues related to prescription drug spending, referencing NHE accounts for data. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national healthcare spending. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016, forecasted to rise to $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national healthcare spending. Prescription drug spending is projected to increase to about 11% of national healthcare spending by 2027. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total healthcare expenditures since 1960. However, some analysts argue that the data on retail drug sales do not provide a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. Since 1960, the NHE data has been compiling prescription spending information, focusing on retail drug sales. However, analysts argue that this data does not give a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. Various studies provide different estimates of total prescription drug spending, taking into account factors like rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers and coupons for consumers. Despite variations in estimates, there is a consistent trend towards higher spending. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the decades, with growth slowing from 2003 to 2013 due to factors like the economic recession, fewer expensive new drugs, and increased use of generic drugs. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. slowed from 2003 to 2013, with an average annual growth rate of 5%. This was due to factors such as the economic recession, fewer expensive new drugs, and increased use of generic drugs. However, in 2014, spending accelerated with a 12.4% increase, the largest in over a decade. Drug spending continued to rise in 2015 before slowing down in 2016 and 2017. Projections show that retail drug spending is expected to grow by about 6.3% annually through 2027, driven partly by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail drug spending is projected to grow by about 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than that of physician services and hospital care. Hearings have been held in response to the sharp increases in drug prices. Retail prescription drug spending is projected to grow by 5% and 5.5% annually through 2027. Hearings have been held in response to the acceleration in spending and sharp increases in drug prices. Factors affecting retail drug spending include changes in drug availability, prices, and usage. The increase in drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven by new high-cost drugs, price hikes for existing drugs, and reduced generic substitution impact. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also contributed to the rise in drug demand. Drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven by new high-cost drugs, price increases for existing drugs, and the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost drugs, and a decrease in spending for diabetes treatment. Drug mix compares the cost of new drugs to older ones, with innovator brand-name drugs being more expensive and generic drugs reducing costs. In 2016, U.S. prescription drug spending slowed due to fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost drugs, and decreased spending on diabetes treatment. The introduction of expensive specialty drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease contributed to the growth in drug spending. New drugs, including generics, can impact drug costs, with hepatitis C drugs alone accounting for a significant portion of the increase in total drug spending in recent years. In 2016, U.S. prescription drug spending growth was driven by new hepatitis C drugs, accounting for a significant portion of the increase. The impact of these expensive drugs is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated and net prices drop. New generic substitution played a smaller role in reducing total drug spending since 2009. Since 2009, patents for best-selling brand-name drugs have expired, leading to the production of new generic versions. In 2012, spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition fell by $32.6 billion. However, annual savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since then. Changes in drug mix, particularly the development of biologics with high introductory prices, will continue to impact spending. The FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but these alternatives have not significantly impacted the market yet. The development of biologics with high introductory prices will continue to impact drug spending. FDA-approved biosimilar substitutes for biologics have not significantly lowered prices yet. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. inflation since 2014, but the gap narrowed in 2017. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017, with drug prices driven by increases in brand-name and new innovator drugs. Existing generic drug prices also rose, but were not a major contributor to inflation according to a 2016 HHS study. Express Scripts found that the average price for commonly used brand-name drugs increased by 10.7% from 2015. The 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7%. ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage boosted demand for drugs by providing tax credits for ACA exchange-based health plans and requiring private insurance plans to cover prescription drugs. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has increased demand for drugs by providing tax credits for ACA exchange-based health plans and requiring private insurance plans to cover prescription drugs. Studies show a 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015, driven by higher utilization. Medicaid coverage under the ACA also expanded, leading to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims and a 20% rise in gross Medicaid prescription drug spending. The aging of the baby boomers has also contributed to increased demand, with patients aged 50 and older accounting for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has increased demand for drugs, with Medicaid contributing to a significant rise in prescription drug claims and spending. The aging population, particularly patients aged 50 and older, has also driven an increase in drug dispensing. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has declined over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs covering a larger share of the nation's retail drug bill. Out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs covering a larger share of the retail drug bill. Consumer cost sharing represents a smaller portion of drug spending, but individuals may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on factors like insurance coverage and drug discounts. Despite a smaller share of overall prescription drug spending, consumers can still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on factors like insurance coverage, drug discounts, and health plan policies. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs, with a rise in drug deductibles and the use of formulary tiered pricing. Coinsurance is being imposed more frequently for expensive drugs, especially in health plans sold on ACA state exchanges. The deductible for prescription drugs has increased to 46% from 23%, especially in health plans on ACA state exchanges. Formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs are becoming more common, leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for consumers. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers faced significantly higher co-payments for high-priced drugs compared to generic drugs. The financial burden on consumers using higher-priced drugs has increased, with average co-payments for tier-four drugs being significantly higher than for generic drugs in employer-sponsored health plans. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by the ACA's cap on annual out-of-pocket spending and expanded patient assistance programs from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Generic drug use rates have also continued to rise, leading to lower cost sharing for consumers. Manufacturers have expanded patient assistance through discount coupons and programs based on health condition and income. Generic drug use rates have increased, leading to lower cost sharing. While average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has declined, the number of consumers with high out-of-pocket costs has risen, especially for those with serious conditions or prescribed specialty drugs. In 2014, nearly 3% of enrollees in large employer-sponsored health plans had out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000, accounting for a significant portion of drug spending and overall out-of-pocket spending. The average out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, with a forecast to increase to $207 by 2026. However, nearly 3% of enrollees in large employer-sponsored health plans had out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014, accounting for a significant portion of drug spending. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, especially for outpatient specialty drugs costing $600 or more per month. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs decreased from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, with a projected increase to $207 by 2026. Government subsidized drug coverage has expanded, leading to a rise in the government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, with a forecast to rise to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits. The United States lacks a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits, procurement, and pricing. Various federal health programs operate different drug discount and contracting systems, with FDA regulating drug safety. Federal agencies can secure discounts, but the amounts vary widely among programs. Medicaid rebates, for example, were 47% of Medicaid spending in 2015. The FDA does not have authority to set drug prices or consider them during drug approval. Federal agencies can obtain discounts for prescription drugs, but the amounts vary among programs. For example, Medicaid rebates were 47% of Medicaid spending in 2015, while Part D rebates were only 15% that year. Legislation has been proposed to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. Legislation has been proposed to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare Part D is designed as a market-oriented program where plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers. Part D is a market-oriented program where plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in these negotiations. Congress has debated the effectiveness of this approach in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. The HHS Secretary is prohibited from intervening in Part D plan negotiations or requiring specific formularies. Congress debates the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial projections, with drug rebates increasing over the years. Studies show lower premiums in areas with robust plan competition, but Part D plans have higher drug prices compared to Medicaid. Some lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, citing potential for larger discounts than individual Part D plans. In 2007, the House approved a bill to allow this negotiation. Some lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, citing potential for larger discounts than individual Part D plans. In 2007, the House approved a bill to allow this negotiation, but it was not approved by the Senate. A CBO analysis suggested that significant savings would only be achieved if the Secretary had additional powers to set prices or create a central formulary. Patient and consumer groups have expressed concerns about potential reductions in drug coverage with increased Secretary control over the Part D formulary. The Obama and Trump Administrations recommended giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D, with proposals for cost savings and additional approaches such as passing on drug rebates to enrollees and moving some drugs from Part B to Part D for lower prices. Patient and consumer groups have opposed giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary, fearing reductions in drug coverage. The Trump Administration has recommended additional approaches for cost savings in Medicare Part D, including passing on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some drugs from Part B to Part D. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential savings in the first decade but possible erosion over time. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing. The CBO stated that cost savings in Medicare Part D could erode over time due to drug manufacturers raising prices to counteract rebates. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, with some offering patient assistance programs for low-income residents. Various approaches are being used by states to limit spending on high-priced drugs and increase transparency in drug prices, such as a California statute setting a $250 cap on cost sharing for a 30-day drug supply. States are implementing laws to address prescription drug spending and access, including setting caps on cost sharing for drugs and requiring transparency in drug prices. Vermont passed a law in 2016 that requires manufacturers to disclose price increases for certain drugs, with regulators compiling a list of drugs with the largest price hikes each year. This legislation aims to make drug companies justify their prices based on costs. The Vermont law requires manufacturers to justify price increases for 15 drugs with the largest annual price hikes. Other states are also implementing legislation to increase transparency in drug pricing and access. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs is significantly higher than the OECD average and any other industrialized nation. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs is significantly higher than the OECD average and any other industrialized nation. Studies have found large price differences for specific drugs between the U.S. and other countries, with U.S. prices often double that of the European Union. Various reasons for higher U.S. spending and prices include faster adoption of new drugs and patent protections. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs than other countries, with prices often double that of the European Union. Reasons for higher U.S. spending include faster adoption of new drugs and patent protections. EU nations use external reference pricing to set drug prices. In the EU, countries use external reference pricing to set drug prices, while in Canada, the Common Drug Review assesses the effectiveness of new and existing drugs for reimbursement. In the US, government and commercial payers are exploring alternative pricing models. In the US, government and commercial payers are experimenting with alternative pricing models. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has a deal with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on health outcomes. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to move towards value-based purchasing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing reports on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly approved drugs. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing public reports on the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and potential budget impact of newly approved drugs, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry about limiting reimbursement and patient access to treatments. ICER has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs and reached out to different segments of the health care industry. The federal government focuses on basic research while the pharmaceutical industry invests more in clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, with studies showing a small percentage of new drugs originating from sources other than private industry. A study in 2003 found that only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 1999 originated from sources other than private industry. Another study in 2010 showed that 24.1% of new molecular entities and biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 were publicly funded. The origin of innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs) by the FDA, is a topic of interest. A study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Additionally, 19% of drugs that received priority review from the FDA were also a result of publicly funded research. The Stevens study revealed that 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007 originated from publicly funded research. Among the drugs granted priority review by the FDA, 19% were a result of publicly funded research, indicating a higher likelihood of priority review for drugs from public-sector research institutions compared to those from private-sector research. The FDA grants priority review for drugs that offer significant improvements in safety or effectiveness. Publicly funded research institutions have a higher likelihood of priority review for drugs. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The Stevens study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies for new drug classes. The Stevens study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds from the analysis, as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates. These technologies enabled the development of many FDA-approved products during the study period. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies, which were crucial for developing many new drugs. Public funding was found to have contributed to every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016, shaping the economic outlook of the pharmaceutical industry. The 2018 study found that public funding from the NIH was associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The analysis showed that up to 20% of the NIH budget, around $100 billion, contributed to research on new drug approvals during that period. This suggests a significant impact of NIH funding on new drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. The study found that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, or about $100 billion, was associated with research contributing to new drug approvals from 2010-2016. This suggests a greater NIH contribution to new drug research than previously recognized. Pharmaceutical companies disclose aggregate R&D spending, but specific drug development costs are not usually available. Academic studies estimate average drug development spending, with the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development being a commonly cited source using data from large drug manufacturers. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development has estimated the average cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2013 dollars, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. This figure is an update from a 2002 analysis that put the cost at $802 million in 2000 dollars. The cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was estimated to be $2.6 billion in 2013 dollars, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. The Tufts study has been challenged by academic and government research, questioning assumptions about the rate of return, drug sampling, and impact of federal tax breaks on research and development spending. The cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug ranges from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and is influenced by factors such as development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs. Transparency legislation aims to compel drugmakers to disclose research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Price transparency legislation being debated in Congress and state legislatures would require drugmakers to provide data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Studies show that research costs are not the main factor in drug pricing, as seen in the case of Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Gilead's pricing strategy focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. The pricing strategy for hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni by Gilead focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. Pfizer's breast cancer drug Ibrance pricing was influenced by existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The US allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, with the FDA regulating to prevent false or misleading ads. The United States allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses from taxes. Marketing efforts also target healthcare providers through various channels. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962, with FDA regulating prescription drug advertising. In 1999, FDA issued guidance on broadcast ads, and has since published updated guidance. Since the 1980s, pharmaceutical advertising has expanded to consumers, with FDA regulations evolving to address this shift. DTC prescription drug advertising reached over $5 billion in 2006, dipped during the 2007 recession, and rebounded by 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads make up the majority of spending, but internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area. FDA regulations require drug companies to submit ads for assessment. Internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area of direct-to-consumer promotion, surpassing television, magazine, and newspaper ads in cost-effectiveness. FDA regulations mandate that drug companies submit ads for assessment to ensure they are fair and balanced. Data from 2001 to 2014 shows an increase in internet prescription drug promotions, while television promotions remain stagnant. Proponents argue that pharmaceutical advertising leads to better-informed consumers who are more engaged in their treatment, resulting in improved diagnosis of undertreated illnesses. Critics question the industry's portrayal of drug benefits and risks. Pharmaceutical advertising contributes to more informed consumers who visit their doctors and become more involved in their treatment. Critics argue that the industry's presentation of drug benefit and risk information may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. New brand-name drugs with higher prices may not always be more effective or safer than existing treatments, raising concerns about their value compared to lower-priced alternatives. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs. A 2015 study found that a 10% rise in drug advertising views leads to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. A 2006 Government Accountability Office report noted that advertising may encourage the use of advertised drugs even if alternatives may be more appropriate. A recent government survey revealed that many people feel DTC advertisements lack sufficient information about the benefits of the drugs. The 2006 Government Accountability Office report found that drug advertising may lead to increased use of advertised drugs, even if alternatives may be more suitable. A recent government survey showed that many people believe DTC ads lack sufficient information about the benefits and risks of the drugs. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads to protect public health and finances. Constitutional issues may arise due to the commercial speech nature of product advertisements. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on direct-to-consumer drug ads to protect public health and finances. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, citing concerns about promoting new drugs without sufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness. Constitutional issues may arise due to the commercial speech nature of product advertisements. The Institute of Medicine recommended FDA restrict DTC advertising of new drugs for two years after introduction. Congress has debated a moratorium on advertising for new drugs and legislation to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Congress has debated the issue of pharmaceutical regulation in the context of tax reform. FDA regulates the sale of drugs in the U.S. market through approved marketing applications that include clinical data, manufacturing procedures, reporting processes, and labeling requirements. The detailed requirements make it unlikely for imported drugs to meet all approval elements. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the United States. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved drugs, but in practice, importation has not been allowed. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, importation has not been allowed. The act required the HHS Secretary to certify to Congress that importation would pose no additional risk to public health and safety and result in cost reduction for consumers. This provision was reworked in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003. The importation provision in the MEDS Act of 2000, later reworked in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003, has never been implemented due to the lack of necessary certifications by the HHS Secretary. This has resulted in the prohibition of importing prescription drugs from abroad by consumers, pharmacists, and wholesalers. The MEDS Act of 2000 and MMA legislation aimed to allow drug importation by entities other than the manufacturer with FDA approval. Attempts have been made to bypass restrictions on drug importation through the agriculture appropriations bill. FDA enforcement on importation has been lenient. The House has passed versions of the agriculture spending bill that would prohibit FDA from using funds to prevent individuals, pharmacists, or wholesalers from importing prescription drugs that comply with FDA requirements. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The FDA's personal-use import policy allows individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, as long as they provide a written statement that the drugs are for their own use and disclose their treating physician's information. The policy was not intended for consumers to import lower-priced prescription drugs into the United States, but rather to permit medical treatments not available in the US. The policy originally allowed importation of cancer or AIDS drugs not sold in the US, but is now used by consumers seeking lower foreign drug prices. The FDA's personal-use import policy allows individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, as long as they provide a written statement that the drugs are for their own use and disclose their treating physician's information. The policy was not intended for consumers to import lower-priced prescription drugs into the United States, but rather to permit medical treatments not available in the US. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation.
