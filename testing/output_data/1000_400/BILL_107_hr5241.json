    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities, including children living with relatives due to parental inability or unwillingness to care for them. Additionally, many children with disabilities live with foster care parents. Approximately 6,000,000 children in the United States live with relatives due to parental inability or unwillingness to care for them. An estimated 165,000 children with disabilities live with foster care parents, and nearly 4,000,000 individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities live with their families. Additionally, around 25 percent of the Nation's elders rely on others for daily needs, and approximately 600,000 Americans die at home each year after extensive family caregiving. Approximately 42 percent of individuals in the United States needing daily living assistance are under age 65. Family caregivers provide services that would cost $200 billion annually if replaced with paid workers. This role, mainly taken on by women, is personally rewarding but can lead to emotional, physical, and financial hardships due to insufficient resources. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women, facing emotional, physical, and financial hardships. They often struggle to find information on available respite care programs, which are insufficient and primarily cater to lower-income populations and the elderly. Limited programs also face challenges in recruiting trained respite workers. The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish State and local lifespan respite care programs, improve respite care information dissemination, provide respite care services to family caregivers, and promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery. The purposes of this title are to improve and coordinate the dissemination of respite care information and resources to family caregivers, provide, supplement, or improve respite care services, promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery, support evaluative research on effective respite care services, and promote the dissemination of research findings. The purpose of this section is to support evaluative research on effective respite care services that alleviate caregiver strain and promote the dissemination of results and information related to respite care delivery and caregiver training. \"Definitions are provided in Section 2802.\" The term 'condition' in this title includes Alzheimer's disease, developmental disabilities, mental retardation, physical disabilities, chronic illness (such as cancer), behavioral and emotional conditions, cognitive impairments, situations at high risk of abuse or neglect, situations where a child's parent is unavailable, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions determined by the Secretary.
