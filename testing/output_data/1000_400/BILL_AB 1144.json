    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products can be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles. A balanced portfolio of renewable energy resources will be procured to achieve the goals of cost-effectiveness and suitability. Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products must meet specific criteria for compliance with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements in California. This includes having a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority, an agreement to dynamically transfer electricity to a California balancing authority, and meeting unbundled renewable requirements. Unbundled renewable energy credits can be earned by electricity generated by an entity excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation. The electricity must be used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity and meet specific criteria. The renewable energy credit requirements for a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity include: meeting specific criteria, generating capability put into service after January 1, 2016, and not participating in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. The wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity must meet specific criteria, have generating capability in service after January 1, 2016, and not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. Retail sellers must procure eligible renewable energy resources to achieve a balanced portfolio. Retail sellers must procure eligible renewable energy resources to achieve a balanced portfolio. This includes meeting specific requirements for the percentage of renewable energy products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010. Retail sellers must procure eligible renewable energy resources to achieve a balanced portfolio. For contracts executed after June 1, 2010, specific percentage requirements apply: 50% for the compliance period ending December 31, 2013, 65% for the period ending December 31, 2016, and 75% thereafter must meet certain product content requirements. Additionally, a maximum of 25% for the period ending December 31, 2013, 15% for the period ending December 31, 2016, and 10% thereafter must meet different product content requirements. Renewable energy resource contracts not subject to these limitations must meet yet another set of product content requirements. Any renewable energy resources contracts executed on or after June 1, 2010, must meet specific product content requirements. Restrictions on crediting eligible renewable energy resource electricity products to each compliance period apply to contracts executed after January 13, 2011. Contracts or ownership agreements executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if the renewable energy resource was eligible at the time of contract execution and approved by the commission for electrical corporations. The renewable energy resource must be eligible under the rules at the time of contract execution. Approval by the commission is required for electrical corporations, even if granted after June 1, 2010. Contract amendments after June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change the resource. Contract duration can be extended if the original commitment was 15 years or more. Any contract amendments after June 1, 2010, must not increase capacity or change the resource. The contract duration can be extended if the original commitment was 15 years or more. Retail sellers can apply for a reduction in procurement content requirements, but the obligation specified in subdivision (c) cannot be reduced below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. For calculating renewables portfolio standard obligations, electricity generated and sold by a public entity with renewable energy credits must be added to the total retail sales of the buyer."
