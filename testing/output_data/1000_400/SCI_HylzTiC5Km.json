It addresses challenges in encoding vast context and learning distributions for large images. Multidimensional upscaling is used to grow images in size and depth efficiently. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) is a decoder architecture that generates images as a sequence of slices, capturing spatial dependencies efficiently. Multidimensional upscaling is used to grow images in size and depth. SPNs are evaluated for image generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in various settings. Autoregressive models have excelled in producing high-fidelity samples across various domains, but struggle with long-range structure and semantic coherence in large-scale image generation. Autoregressive models have achieved state-of-the-art fidelity in various domains, except for large-scale image generation where long-range structure and semantic coherence are lacking. Difficulties in high-fidelity image generation stem from the complex relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity, as well as the high dimensionality of large images. Autoregressive models struggle with high-fidelity image generation due to the complex relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity, as well as the high dimensionality of large images. The model's capacity to generalize is compromised by supporting the entire empirical distribution, leading to irrelevant allocation of resources. Large images require significant memory and computation due to the need to connect numerous positions for learning dependencies. The text discusses the challenges of high-fidelity image generation with autoregressive models due to memory and computation requirements. It aims to learn the distribution of 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size with a focus on visually salient subsets. The text discusses learning the distribution of 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size with a focus on visually salient subsets. It involves mapping between subsets using Multidimensional Upscaling, starting with smaller sub-images or significant bits and upscaling in size or depth. Upscaling involves mapping between subsets of the distribution by increasing image size or depth. Three networks are trained: a decoder for small size, low depth images, a size-upscaling decoder, and a depth-upscaling decoder. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture is developed to address training difficulties. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture addresses training difficulties by dividing images into sub-images and generating slices conditioned on previously generated slices to encode rich spatial structure. It consists of a conditioning network and a decoder that predicts target slices. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) generates image slices one at a time based on previously generated slices, using a conditioning network and a decoder. It can be used for implicit or explicit size upscaling and has been evaluated on image generation benchmarks for performance comparison with previous methods.

The SPN and multidimensional upscaling set a fidelity baseline for future methods, showcasing their impact on sample quality. The PixelCNN generates color images pixel by pixel using a deep neural network. An alternative ordering divides large images into slices to encode long-range dependencies and induce spatial structure. This approach improves image quality and size upscaling. The approach of dividing large images into slices improves image quality and size upscaling by encoding long-range dependencies and inducing spatial structure. This method allows for consistent application of the same decoder within the neural architecture and enables the use of self-attention in the SPN without local contexts. The subscale ordering in the SPN allows for two-dimensional ordering without local contexts. It involves selecting slices based on a scaling factor, creating interleaved slices in the original image. The subscale ordering captures size upscaling implicitly and can be used with size-only, depth-only, and multidimensional upscaling.

The subscale ordering captures size upscaling implicitly and can be used with size-only, depth-only, and multidimensional upscaling. Additionally, a single slice decoder can be trained on subimages to generate the first slice of a subscale ordering, with the rest of the image generated according to the ordering by the main network. This approach allows the SPN to act as both a full-blown image model and a size upscaling model simultaneously.

The SPN architecture includes an embedding part with a convolutional neural network for preceding slices, ensuring alignment in the input for equivariance in the embedding architecture. The embedding part of the SPN architecture ensures alignment in the input for equivariance by using padding slices and meta-position embeddings. The decoder processes encoded representations of pixels in preceding slices in a position-preserving manner. The decoder in the SPN architecture uses a hybrid architecture combining masked convolution and self-attention. It employs a 1D self-attention network to gather context in the slice before reshaping it into a 1D tensor for processing with masked 1D self-attention layers. The output is then reshaped back into a 2D tensor. The SPN decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture with masked convolution and self-attention. It reshapes the slice into a 1D tensor for processing with masked 1D self-attention layers, resulting in significantly lower memory requirements. The output is then reshaped back into a 2D tensor and used as conditioning input for a Gated PixelCNN to model the target slice.

The log-likelihood is decomposed as a sum over slices, with maximum likelihood learning done through stochastic gradient descent. The SPN also serves as a size-upscaling network when initialized with an externally generated subimage. The SPN decoder, depicted in FIG4 (a), performs maximum likelihood learning through stochastic gradient descent on a Monte Carlo estimate. It naturally serves as a size-upscaling network when initialized with an externally generated subimage. The SPN can also upscale the depth of image channels by dividing the image into slices and concatenating them along the channel dimension. The image is divided into slices using the subscale method and then concatenated along the channel dimension to create a conditioning image. This conditioning image is added as input to the SPN model to generate high-fidelity samples at high resolution, outperforming the Glow model BID7.
