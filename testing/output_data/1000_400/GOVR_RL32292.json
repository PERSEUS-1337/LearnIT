    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with firms outside the country for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss and unemployment, especially in light of the high post-recession unemployment rate. Heightened public policy concerns arise due to job loss and foregone employment opportunities among U.S. workers, especially with the high post-recession unemployment rate. The implications of offshore outsourcing on the labor market remain unclear, with some attributing it to the \"jobless recovery\" from the 2001 recession. However, the historical link between economic growth and job creation suggests that the labor market may eventually recover. Offshoring alone may have accounted for around 3% of net job loss. The historical link between economic growth and job creation suggests that the labor market will eventually recover from downturns in the business cycle. Offshoring may have contributed to a small percentage of job loss, but many economists believe it benefits the nation by enabling firms to sell higher quality products at lower prices. Many economists believe that trade and globalization benefit the nation by offering a greater variety of products at lower prices. However, there are concerns that offshoring of service activities mainly benefits companies, leading to increased dividends and stock prices instead of promoting growth in the U.S. economy. Some economists believe that offshoring service activities primarily benefits companies by lowering input costs, leading to increased dividends and stock prices. The movement of service jobs to other countries may have different implications for the labor market compared to production jobs. Data shows that factory workers have lower educational levels, while administrative and professional workers are more likely to have college degrees. This shift in the skill level of offshored jobs raises questions about the impact on college graduates. The offshoring of service activities may result in college graduates facing a dwindling supply of entry-level jobs, raising concerns about the impact on well-educated office workers who lose their jobs. Questions arise about whether existing trade adjustment assistance programs can adequately support these workers. Congress aims to promote U.S. job growth and assist workers affected by job losses due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. Assistance programs aim to meet the needs of well-educated office workers losing their jobs to offshoring. Congress strives to promote job growth and support workers affected by job losses, whether due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. Some policymakers support measures to encourage U.S. firms to expand employment domestically rather than abroad, while others advocate for limited government intervention to promote economic growth. The report examines the impact of offshore outsourcing on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to help policymakers evaluate retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The report discusses the historical context of outsourcing by U.S. companies, focusing on the overseas relocation of manufacturing work in the 1970s and 1980s. It highlights the impact of offshore outsourcing on U.S. employment since the early 2000s, aiming to help policymakers assess retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. During the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese and European multinational corporations outsourced production to facilities abroad, displacing well-paid U.S. factory workers. U.S. companies also began contracting out activities to specialized domestic enterprises for efficiency, leading to a permanent reorganization of work in the United States. The 2001 recession further prompted employers to outsource jobs to temporary help agencies, professional services, and independent contractors. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to achieve further efficiencies by outsourcing jobs to help agencies, professional services, and independent contractors. This shift towards domestic outsourcing of in-house functions is a permanent reorganization of work in the United States, enabled by technological innovations that minimize physical distance between companies. Technologies now allow for offshoring of services beyond just goods production to include jobs like software coding, credit-card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis for U.S. companies. The advancement in technology has enabled U.S. firms to extend offshoring to services beyond goods production, including jobs like software coding, credit-card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis. The Y2K crisis in the late 1990s led to U.S. firms outsourcing code fixes to companies in India, enhancing their ability to export IT services to developed countries. The Y2K crisis in the late 1990s prompted U.S. firms to outsource code fixes to companies in India, leading to the export of IT services to developed countries. Low-wage foreign nations, such as China, Eastern Europe, India, and the Philippines, produced a surplus of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills, allowing for services to be provided from non-English-speaking, low-wage countries. The surplus of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills in low-wage countries like China, Eastern Europe, India, and the Philippines has allowed U.S.-based companies to fragment tasks across borders in manufacturing and information services. This includes outsourcing intangible production tasks such as research, design, management, and IT support to countries like Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Jordan, Lithuania, Mexico, Slovenia, Russia, and Ukraine. The extension of task fragmentation to service activities has led to increased wage dispersion in the United States. Technological change and deunionization have also contributed to wage polarization during the 1980s and 1990s. Data on job losses due to offshoring are limited to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended mass layoffs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended mass layoffs provides limited data on job losses due to offshoring, underestimating the actual number of jobs lost. The series focuses on large layoffs at firms with at least 50 employees, primarily in manufacturing, and consistently finds relatively few job losses from work moving out of the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended mass layoffs focuses on large job cuts at firms with at least 50 employees, mainly in manufacturing. It underestimates job losses from offshoring, with few losses attributed to work moving overseas. Forrester Research, Inc. provides additional data on offshoring trends in the service sector. Forrester Research, Inc. forecasts that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015. Half of these jobs were projected to relocate outside the United States within the first 7 years, with the rest moving over the following 5 years. This indicates a trend of increasing offshoring of service activities. Bhagwati et al. note that the annual average job loss of 300,000 through 2015 is a small share of total job creation. Researchers have focused on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring and estimating U.S. employment in these activities. Bardhan and Kroll found that 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could be sent overseas due to certain attributes. In the early years of services offshoring, Bardhan and Kroll estimated that over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, representing about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could be sent overseas. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers. The vulnerable occupational groups to offshoring include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers. A study projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring between 2004-2015. Projections show that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring between 2004-2015. Some metro areas like Boulder, Lowell, San Francisco, San Jose, and Stamford might experience slightly higher job losses by 2015. Vulnerable areas tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs. Areas most vulnerable to services offshoring are populous with over 1 million inhabitants, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. Jensen and Kletzer estimated that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. They found that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries being particularly vulnerable to offshoring. They also examined the task content of service occupations to rank their vulnerability to offshoring based on factors like face-to-face contact, telecommutability, and IT-enabled work processes. Jensen and Kletzer analyzed the task content of 457 service occupations to determine their vulnerability to offshoring. They identified occupational groups like computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and business operations as highly offshorable. These occupations accounted for 27.4% of all service employment in 2005. The degree of offshorability was linked to the level of education required for the job. In 2005, Jensen and Kletzer identified service occupations in architecture, engineering, legal, business, and office support as highly offshorable, accounting for 27.4% of all service employment. Occupations with higher educational attainment were more vulnerable to offshoring. BLS estimated that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, with a focus on professional and technical categories, including computer and mathematical science occupations. In 2007, BLS estimated that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, with a focus on professional and technical categories. More than half of these offshorable occupations are in computer and mathematical science fields. These offshorable service-providing occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007, with slightly faster employment growth and comparatively greater wage growth between 2001 and 2007. However, the 33 most susceptible service-providing occupations experienced below-average employment and wage growth during this period. Between 2001 and 2007, offshorable service-providing occupations saw faster employment and wage growth compared to overall service-providing employment. However, the 33 most vulnerable occupations experienced below-average growth in both employment and wages. These occupations range from office and administrative support roles to professional and technical positions, with varying levels of education and training requirements. Blinder created an index of offshorability for various occupations, estimating that a majority of occupations are non offshorable while a minority are highly offshorable. This included 22.2% of U.S. workers in 2004, but he considered this estimate too conservative due to technological advances. Blinder estimated that a minority of U.S. occupations and workers fall in offshorable categories, totaling almost 30 million workers or 29.0% of all U.S. jobs. He stated that offshorable occupations are not low-end jobs and the correlation between skill and offshorability is almost zero. Blinder's aggressive estimate suggests that almost 40 million workers, totaling 29.0% of all U.S. jobs, are in offshorable occupations. He found that the correlation between skill and offshorability is minimal, contradicting the belief that offshorable jobs are low-end. Blinder used three survey methods to determine that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable. Blinder and Krueger used three survey methods to determine that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, especially prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, and in industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Some believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated, with only a small fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes work being realized through 2006. Some experts believe that only a small fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes work has been realized through 2006. Executives need to learn how to use offshore talent effectively to boost productivity. There is caution about the future pace of moving vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad, with outsourcing losing its \"holy grail\" status. Companies will no longer outsource just because it's a management trend, but will carefully define core functions to retain knowledge in-house. Some organizations are cautious about moving U.S. jobs abroad, with outsourcing losing its appeal. Companies will define core functions to keep in-house for control and knowledge retention. Re-insourcing is on the rise, with companies like Dell bringing services back to the U.S. due to customer dissatisfaction. Other firms are also returning IT services and call center operations to the U.S. Some U.S. firms are bringing back services from overseas due to customer dissatisfaction and other factors. This includes IT services, call center operations, and manufacturing, with some crediting \"reshoring\" for part of the sector's employment rebound since the recession. According to recent surveys, Perry found that about one-fifth of companies brought production back from overseas in 2011 due to China's shrinking manufacturing advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Perry cited examples like Caterpillar, National Cash Register, and Wham-O. Despite factors like 9/11, offshore providers were able to allay security fears, allowing offshoring to continue. Offshore providers of IT services were able to address U.S. firms' security concerns post-9/11, allowing for continued outsourcing. U.S. airline carriers have also increased outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas, even for domestic routes. Concerns over unrest in certain regions have prompted global software service providers to diversify work locations, including near-shore markets like Canada and Mexico. Global providers of software services have responded to concerns over unrest in certain regions by diversifying work locations, including near-shore markets like Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers believe that moving work to nearby Canada reduces potential customer antipathy to offshoring. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. Comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is lacking. Despite rising labor costs in certain Asian nations like India, low wages in countries such as Vietnam still attract U.S. jobs. Comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is lacking, with empirical analyses focusing on job characteristics susceptible to movement beyond U.S. borders. This approach may overstate job losses as it does not consider all factors influencing employers' decisions on work location."
