The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners, as outlined in the 2010 National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act. Congress also acknowledges the findings of the National Academy of Sciences regarding human space flight goals and capabilities. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a review of human space flight goals and capabilities, publishing findings and recommendations in a 2014 report. The Committee on Human Spaceflight concluded that various rationales support human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and inspiring citizens. Spaceflight concluded that various rationales support human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and inspiring citizens. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve placing humans on Mars. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars, with a focus on extending human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA is required to submit a strategy to achieve this objective. The Administrator of NASA is tasked with submitting a strategy for human exploration of Mars, utilizing cis-lunar space and key capabilities provided under specific titles of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. The Administrator of NASA is required to develop a strategy for human exploration of Mars, utilizing cis-lunar space and key capabilities provided under specific titles of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. This strategy should include the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for missions to various destinations, economic, scientific, and technological advances, and opportunities for collaboration. The curr_chunk discusses the opportunities for collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies in expanding human presence in cis-lunar space. It also highlights the importance of the International Space Station for supporting scientific research and technological developments. The curr_chunk discusses the scientific needs and opportunities provided by the International Space Station (ISS) for supporting high priority research and technological developments in expanding human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond. It also includes a range of exploration mission architectures and approaches, comparing them based on factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and opportunities for international collaboration. The curr_chunk compares architectures and approaches based on factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, opportunities for international collaboration, enabling new markets, opportunities for US private industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, US competitiveness, leadership, and national security considerations. The curr_chunk discusses measures for ensuring crew health and safety in space missions, including radiation exposure limits, medical countermeasures, and addressing urgent medical conditions. The curr_chunk outlines crew training needs, capabilities, and a plan for prioritizing near-term intermediate destinations and missions in space missions. The curr_chunk details crew training needs, capabilities, prioritizing near-term missions, and assessing recommendations from a previous report. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 requires the Administrator to ensure recommendations are incorporated into the strategy and provide technical information to identify interest from stakeholders. An independent review by the National Academy of Sciences is also mandated for each interim report. The Administrator must arrange for an independent review by the National Academy of Sciences for each interim report on the strategy, which includes identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and recommendations. The Administrator must ensure timely review and incorporation of National Academy of Sciences' comments on interim reports regarding identified matters, concerns, and recommendations in the strategy. The Administrator must ensure timely review and incorporation of National Academy of Sciences' comments on interim reports regarding the strategy required by paragraph (1) to facilitate independent review and comment. The Administrator must submit interim reports to the National Academy of Sciences every five years for independent review and comment on the strategy required by paragraph (1). Final reports must be submitted to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act, incorporating the Academy's response to the interim reports."
