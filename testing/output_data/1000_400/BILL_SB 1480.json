    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15th each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements before approving the exemption. Financial statements are only required if requested in writing. Any capital investment for plant expansion must be justified by expected returns and serve community interests. Property claiming exemption must be used for exempt activity and not exceed necessary amount. Assessor can audit to verify compliance with requirements. Assessor can deny welfare exemption claim even with organizational clearance certificate. The assessor may conduct an audit to verify if the property owner meets requirements for exemption. The assessor can deny a welfare exemption claim even with an organizational clearance certificate. If the property is found ineligible, the claimant can seek a refund through the county or file a refund action in superior court. If the claimant's refund claim with the county is denied, they can file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption does not need to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes to the exempted property and it is used exclusively by a governmental entity or nonprofit corporation. The applicant must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible for the exemption or if the property no longer meets the requirements. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption. The notice also explains the process to reaffirm exemption eligibility for the next fiscal year. Failure to reaffirm eligibility may prompt the assessor to verify exempt activity. If a welfare or veterans' organization exemption is found to be incorrectly granted, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel the exemption if necessary. Any incorrectly allowed exemption will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Counties can request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by applying in writing to the board by November 30. Applications for assessments made outside the regular period must be filed within 60 days of the tax bill being mailed to the assessee. Every application for property assessment relief must be filed with the assessor and the board, which will provide notice and a hearing. Failure to file timely will result in the applicant being barred from relief. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to state that any excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund, after satisfying certain distributions, can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. If not claimed within a specified period, the excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund after deducting certain costs."
