    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly U.S. population by 2019. The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (H.R. 3548) is projected to reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years. By 2019, it would insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population. The total cost of coverage provisions, including Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers, would be $1.052 trillion over 10 years. However, the net cost of the coverage provisions would be $891 billion, offset by other spending changes and income tax surcharges on high-income individuals. The CBO analysis projects that the Affordable Health Care for America Act would cost $891 billion over 10 years. The bill aims to reduce the number of uninsured, restructure the private health insurance market, set minimum health benefit standards, provide financial assistance, and raise revenues. The House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act on November 7, 2009. The bill focuses on reducing the number of uninsured individuals, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum health benefit standards, providing financial assistance, and implementing provisions to raise revenues. Key provisions include mandatory health insurance for individuals and employers, market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal, and acceptable coverage under a qualified health benefits plan. Reforms in the Affordable Health Care for America Act include modified community rating, guaranteed issue and renewal, and linking individual and employer mandates to acceptable health insurance coverage. Acceptable coverage would be under a qualified health benefits plan offered through the Exchange or other plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. The Exchange, established under a new federal agency, would offer private plans and a public option. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely with no changes. A Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program would encourage the creation of member-run health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to create not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange. It would not affect plans for specific services like dental or vision care. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The report provides background information on the private insurance market and summarizes key provisions of H.R. 3962 affecting private health insurance. The provisions aim to reform how current private health insurance markets function, with most changes effective from 2013 onwards. The Appendix outlines the timeline for implementing provisions effective before 2013, focusing on private health insurance reforms in H.R. 3962. The bill aims to prevent insurers from excluding individuals or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions to address adverse selection and increase coverage. In a system where individuals voluntarily choose health insurance, adverse selection can lead to higher premiums and uninsurance. Insurers guard against this by excluding preexisting conditions. AHIP suggests requiring individuals to purchase coverage to prevent adverse selection. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary for those who cannot afford insurance. Individuals may need to purchase health insurance to prevent adverse selection and ensure market reforms. Adequate premium subsidies are essential for affordability. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other provisions like abortion and end-of-life care. In 2008, 60% of Americans had employment-based health insurance, while approximately 46 million were uninsured. Individuals may obtain health coverage through private sector or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. There is no federal law mandating individuals to have health insurance or employers to offer it. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fitting into one of three segments - the large group market, the small group market, and the nongroup market. Large employers, who make up more than 95% of the market, can obtain lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool of enrollees. Large employers, comprising over 95% of the market, can secure lower premiums for health insurance packages compared to small employers and individuals. This is due to economies of scale and a larger, more diverse risk pool, making expected costs more predictable. Employers offer substantial subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers. States have experimented with creating a single platform for comparing insurance plans and pooling risks, learning from past failures to develop more sustainable models. States have experimented with creating a single platform for comparing insurance plans and pooling risks, learning from past failures to develop more sustainable models. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited risk pooling ability. Insurers view small firms as higher risk. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited risk pooling ability. Small firms face disadvantages in comparison to larger counterparts, such as being more likely to be medically underwritten and having little market power to negotiate benefits and rates with insurance carriers. Small employers face challenges in providing health insurance due to disadvantages compared to larger firms, including being medically underwritten and having limited bargaining power. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or higher premiums based on health status in the nongroup market. Reforms in premium ratings could increase or decrease premiums based on age and health. In the nongroup market, individuals may face rejection or higher premiums based on their health status, leading to lower premiums for the healthy and higher premiums for the sick. Reforms in premium ratings could result in increased premiums for some and decreased premiums for others, depending on factors like age and health. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires small group coverage to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis, ensuring acceptance for all small employers applying for coverage. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups (2-50 employees) and self-employed individuals in certain states. Premium rating rules vary among states in the small group and individual markets, ranging from community rating to rate bands. States require issuers to offer insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules in small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating, rate bands, or no restrictions. Pure community rating means all enrollees pay the same premium regardless of health or age. Adjusted community rating allows pricing based on factors like age or gender. Rate bands permit limited premium variation based on health factors. In the small group market, states have different premium rating rules ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating and rate bands. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range. Federal law limits the exclusion period for preexisting conditions in group health plans. Some states have stricter preexisting condition exclusion rules than the federal standard. Federal law requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to limit the period when coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded. In the small group market, 21 states have stricter preexisting condition exclusion rules than the federal standard, while in the individual market, 42 states limit the exclusion period for certain enrollees. There is a debate in Congress about whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be part of insurance market reform. Some proponents argue that a public health insurance plan could offer lower costs and increased competition by not needing to generate profits or pay brokers. However, opponents fear it could give the government an unfair advantage in setting prices. Some opponents question whether a public health insurance plan would provide the government with an unfair advantage in setting prices and potentially drive private plans from the market. Studies have shown that non-profit health insurance organizations may perform better in terms of quality compared to for-profit organizations. Non-profit health insurance organizations outperform for-profit ones in terms of quality, as shown in studies. Non-profit health maintenance organizations scored higher on quality measures. Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have also shown strong performance. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have performed well according to recent case studies. Advocates argue that co-operatives reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, benefits, and innovative programs. Congressional attention is focused on incentivizing new co-operatives, while opponents question their success in most areas. Advocates of health insurance co-operatives argue that they reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, benefits, and innovative programs. Opponents question their success and the affordability of health insurance. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits. Some provisions of the bill that would take effect before January 1, 2013 include prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program, and requiring health insurance issuers to provide rebates for low medical loss ratios. The bill requires health insurance issuers to provide rebates if coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level, with a minimum of 85%. This provision applies to both small and large group markets until plans are offered via the Health Insurance Exchange. It also allows individuals up to age 26 to remain on their parents' insurance plans. Insurers must justify any premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. The bill requires health insurance issuers to justify premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. It allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance plans. The bill reduces the look-back period for pre-existing conditions to 30 days and prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition. Lifetime limits on benefits are prohibited, and plans must cover benefits for congenital or developmental conditions in dependent children. The bill prohibits lifetime limits on benefits and requires plans to cover congenital or developmental conditions in dependent children. It also includes a mandate for most individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. The Secretary would issue guidance on rescission limitations and establish a temporary reinsurance program for employment-based plans. H.R. 3962 mandates most individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes plans like QHBP, Medicare, Medicaid, and military coverage. Noncompliance could result in an additional tax. Individuals who did not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage could face an additional tax, prorated based on income. Some may receive subsidies to help with premiums and cost-sharing. Exemptions from the mandate include nonresident aliens and those residing outside the country. H.R. 3962 would require employers to offer health insurance or pay into the Exchange, with exemptions for certain individuals like nonresident aliens and those with religious exemptions. Subsidies would be provided to help with premiums and cost-sharing. H.R. 3962 mandates employers to provide health insurance or contribute to the Exchange, with exceptions for certain entities. Employers must offer coverage through a QHBP or current plan, with rules for eligibility. Grandfathered plans have a five-year transition period before meeting essential benefits package requirements. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan offered. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current employment-based plan they offer, prorated for part-time employees. Salary reductions used to offset required contributions would not count as amounts paid by the employer. Employers would automatically enroll employees into the plan with the lowest premium, unless the employee opts out or chooses a different plan. Written notice of rights and obligations related to auto enrollment must be provided to employees. Compliance with health regulations must be demonstrated by employers. Employers must automatically enroll employees in the plan with the lowest premium unless the employee opts out or chooses a different plan. Written notice of rights and obligations related to auto enrollment must be provided. Employers must demonstrate compliance with health regulations by providing certain information. The Secretary of HHS could terminate an employer's election to provide health insurance for substantial noncompliance. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer coverage may be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees can decline employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, potentially responsible for the full premium. Beginning in 2014, employers may face consequences if an employee declines their qualifying coverage. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 may face an 8% excise tax if an employee declines their qualifying coverage. Employees can opt for an Exchange plan instead, potentially responsible for the full premium. The payroll assessment for employees who decline employer coverage would go into the Exchange but not apply towards the individual's premium. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 may face an 8% excise tax if an employee declines their qualifying coverage. Employees can opt for an Exchange plan instead, potentially responsible for the full premium. The employer's payroll assessment for spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan would not apply towards the individual's premium. Full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer would generally not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. Small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years, phased out as average employee compensation and number of employees increase. Small businesses eligible for a 50% credit towards qualified employee health coverage for up to two years. Credit phased out as average employee compensation and number of employees increase. Employees must receive at least $5,000 in compensation to be counted. Credit not applicable to highly compensated employees. Adjustments for inflation starting in 2013. Non-profit organizations ineligible for the credit. H.R. 3962 introduces new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions or health status. The small business credit for employee health coverage is applicable only to businesses with tax liability, not non-profit organizations. The market reforms applicable to QHBPs include prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing health conditions or health status, and requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. Require coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis, with premiums determined using adjusted community rating rules. This provision applies to all individual and group health plans, ensuring acceptance of all applicants for health coverage. Premiums under H.R. 3962 would be determined using adjusted community rating rules, allowing variation based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination standards would also be imposed. H.R. 3962 would require QHBPs to cover certain benefits, impose non-discrimination standards, and ensure adequacy of insurers' provider networks. It also mandates coverage for dependent children under 27 on the family policy and notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing 90 days in advance. H.R. 3962 mandates QHBPs to cover specific benefits, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy standards. It also requires coverage for dependent children under 27 on the family policy and notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing 90 days in advance. Existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards by 2018, and new individual policies issued after 2013 can only be offered as Exchange plans.

It requires coverage for dependent children under 27 on the family policy and notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing 90 days in advance. Existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards by 2018, and new individual policies issued after 2013 can only be offered as Exchange plans. States can form Health Care Choice Compacts for selling individual health insurance plans across state lines. H.R. 3962 allows states to create Health Care Choice Compacts for selling individual health insurance plans across state lines. The compacts would be subject to the laws of one primary state but allow secondary states to enforce specific rules. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance coverage in secondary states, requiring QHBPs to cover essential benefits and potentially additional benefits. Grants are available to states for regulating health insurance coverage in secondary states. QHBPs must cover essential benefits and may offer additional benefits, including hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, and supplies. The essential benefits package must comply with network adequacy standards and be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. The essential benefits package required for QHBPs includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, and durable medical equipment. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, durable medical equipment, and other services for individuals under age 21. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments and not coinsurance, covering an average of 70% of covered health care claims. The cost-sharing levels for the essential benefits package would be determined by the Health Benefits Advisory Committee and the HHS Secretary, covering an average of 70% of health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have different cost-sharing levels as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans could offer cost-sharing levels lower than those specified for the essential benefits package. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would make recommendations to the Secretary regarding these levels. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would recommend cost-sharing levels for employer plans, excluding grandfathered plans or those from the Exchange, to offer flexibility in employee cost-sharing. The Committee would also suggest covered benefits, specific cost-sharing levels, and updates to the essential benefits package, incorporating innovation in healthcare and public input. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would develop cost-sharing structures consistent with actuarial values for different plan tiers in the Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Secretary must adopt benefit standards within 18 months, either based on HBAC recommendations or by proposing initial standards. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would provide access to insurers' plans in a similar way to online travel booking platforms like Travelocity or Expedia. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962 would not be an insurer but would facilitate the purchase of QHBPs by individuals and small businesses. It would negotiate with plans, oversee requirements, determine eligibility, and administer credits. The Exchange would be established under a new federal agency, funded by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, funded by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. The Exchange would oversee the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses, with costs covered by taxes, penalties, and payroll assessments. Only one Exchange would operate in each state, with the Commissioner approving state-based Exchanges meeting specific criteria. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, funded by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. The Exchange would oversee the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses, with costs covered by taxes, penalties, and payroll assessments. State-based Exchanges would be funded through a federal matching grant to states, with only one Exchange operating in each state. The Commissioner would approve state-based Exchanges meeting specific criteria. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup plans would be excluded, and additional sums may be appropriated for the Exchange. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962, established by the Health Choices Administration, would oversee the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans. State-based Exchanges would be funded through federal grants, with the Commissioner approving compliant states. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup plans would be excluded, and Exchange coverage would be available for individuals and small employers. CBO estimated that by 2019, 30 million people would obtain Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962, overseen by the Health Choices Administration, would facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans. By 2019, CBO estimated 30 million people would have Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Eligibility for Exchange coverage would be available to individuals and small employers, with certain exceptions like Medicare and Medicaid enrollment. The employer can contribute towards employees' enrollment in the Exchange, which would make them eligible for Exchange coverage until they are no longer enrolled. There would be an annual open-enrollment period from September to November, lasting at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers could meet the employer mandate requirements by offering and contributing adequately towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employees would have the option to choose from available Exchange plans. Employers can become Exchange-eligible by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employees can choose from available Exchange plans. In 2013, employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible, in 2014 it would be 50 or fewer employees, and in 2015 it would be 100 or fewer employees. The Commissioner could permit larger employers to participate in the Exchange starting in 2015. In 2014, employers with 50 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2015, the Commissioner could permit larger employers to participate in the Exchange. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. The Exchange plans are standardized into four cost-sharing/benefit tiers: Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus. Each tier offers different levels of cost-sharing for benefits in the essential benefits package. The Exchange plans are standardized into four cost-sharing/benefit tiers: Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus. Premium plans in the service area have a lower cost-sharing level (approximately 95% actuarial value) for benefits in the essential package. Premium-Plus plans offer additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans must adhere to cost-sharing levels specified by the Secretary but can vary by up to 10%. State requirements for additional benefits beyond the essential package apply to Exchange plans if the state reimburses the Commissioner satisfactorily. Under H.R. 3962, the Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange. Any individual eligible to purchase insurance through the Exchange would be eligible to enroll in the public option, and may also be eligible for income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option would have to meet the requirements that apply to all Exchange-participating plans, including those related to benefits, provider networks, consumer protections, and cost-sharing. The public option under H.R. 3962 would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with the possibility of Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set by the Secretary to cover expected costs. Limited start-up funding would be repaid within 10 years, and the public option would be prohibited from receiving federal funds if insolvent. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare services. The public option under H.R. 3962 would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans with geographically adjusted premiums set by the Secretary. Limited start-up funding would be repaid within 10 years, and the public option would be prohibited from receiving federal funds if insolvent. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare services, ensuring rates are not lower than Medicare and not higher than average rates paid by other qualified entities. Physicians could participate in the public option as preferred providers. Physicians in the public option can be preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred providers not allowed to balance-bill. Non-preferred providers can balance-bill up to 115% of a reduced payment rate. Non-physician providers are prohibited from balance-billing. The Secretary has the authority to use innovative payment methods under the public option and must implement payment and delivery system reforms. The Secretary has the authority to use innovative payment methods under the public option, including bundling of services, performance-based payments, and utilization-based payments. Payment and delivery system reforms successful under other parts of this Act must be implemented. No-risk contracts can be entered into for the administration of the public option, similar to the Medicare program. Administrative functions include determining payment amounts, making payments, beneficiary education, provider consultative services, and provider education and technical assistance. The Secretary enters contracts for Medicare program administration, including payment determination, beneficiary education, provider services, and VA cost collection. Public option enrollment is voluntary, allowing individuals, including Members of Congress, to choose Exchange plans. Enrollment in the public option is voluntary, allowing individuals, including Members of Congress, to choose Exchange plans. The bill also includes a program for establishing not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with an appropriation of $5 billion for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The bill includes a program for establishing not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with an appropriation of $5 billion for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. Loans and grants would be used for start-up costs and solvency requirements, with specific conditions to be met for eligibility. The cooperative must offer insurance coverage exclusively to beneficiaries of the insurance it provides, with ethical standards to prevent industry interference. It cannot be affiliated with an insurance company before July 16, 2009, or sponsored by a state government. It must issue Qualified Health Benefit Plans through exchanges, be licensed in all states it operates, and have governance determined by member majority vote. The cooperative issues Qualified Health Benefit Plans through exchanges, is licensed in all states it operates, and has governance determined by member majority vote. Profits are used to lower premiums or improve benefits for members. Grants and loans prioritize cooperatives with statewide operations, integrated delivery systems, or significant financial support from nongovernmental sources. In making grants and loans, the Commissioner prioritizes cooperatives operating statewide, using integrated delivery systems, or with significant financial support from nongovernmental sources. Violations of the CO-OP program require repayment of loans or grants plus interest. Premium credits are available based on income, but cost-sharing may still be unaffordable for some individuals. Cooperatives can integrate across state lines. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 may also receive cost-sharing credits for Basic plans sold through the Exchange in 2013 and 2014. Starting in 2015, they could choose Enhanced or Premium plans but would need to pay any additional premiums and would not qualify for cost-sharing credits. Subsidies for Basic plans in the Exchange under H.R. 3962 are available for eligible individuals with income below 400% of the federal poverty level, excluding those with certain types of existing coverage. Subsidies for Basic plans in the Exchange under H.R. 3962 are available for eligible individuals with income below 400% of the federal poverty level, excluding those with certain types of existing coverage. The premium credit is based on an \"affordable premium amount\" for individuals to pay, calculated as a percentage of income relative to the poverty level. For more details on the premium credits, refer to CRS Report R40878, Health Insurance Premium Credits Under H.R. 3962. Beginning in 2014, the Commissioner would implement these provisions. The affordable premium amount is determined based on individuals' income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner would adjust the percentages in the table to maintain the government's share of premiums versus enrollees in each income tier. The affordability premium credit is calculated as the lesser of how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable premium amount or how much the reference premium exceeds the affordable amount. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on income tiers, with increases on a linear sliding scale. Affordable premium credits are calculated monthly, with assistance for cost-sharing available to those eligible for premium credits in 2013. The Commissioner would set premium percentage limits based on income tiers, with increases on a linear sliding scale. Affordable premium credits are calculated monthly, and assistance for cost-sharing is available to those eligible for premium credits in 2013. Additionally, reductions in cost-sharing amounts and annual out-of-pocket maximums would be specified to align with actuarial values. The out-of-pocket limits in the table would be doubled for family coverage. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The Commissioner would adjust out-of-pocket maximums based on income tiers and pay insurers additional amounts to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. Premium percentage limits would be set based on income tiers, with increases on a linear sliding scale. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Table 4 identifies these provisions and their estimated revenue over a 10-year period. Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidy payments, which are excludable from the employer's gross income. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage by reducing the deduction amount by the federal subsidy received. H.R. 3962 would reduce the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage by the amount of federal subsidy received, raising $2.2 billion over 10 years. Tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs will be affected by the revenue provisions in the bill. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation in subsequent years. This provision aims to raise $13.3 billion according to the JCT. H.R. 3962 proposes limiting annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation. This provision is expected to raise $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs, unlike FSAs, allow for rollover of funds and tax-free distributions for qualified medical expenses. H.R. 3962 proposes increasing the penalty on non-qualified distributions from HSAs to 20% of the disbursed amount, aiming to raise $1.3 billion over 10 years. The bill also modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses for all tax-advantaged accounts. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 would modify tax-advantaged plans, including changing the definition of qualified medical expenses for FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs. It would no longer allow over-the-counter medications to be covered unless prescribed by a physician, increasing revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. State laws regarding abortion coverage/funding would not be preempted under this bill. The provision in H.R. 3962 would increase revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. State laws on abortion coverage/funding would not be preempted, and federal conscience protection laws would not be affected. The bill prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. It restricts the recommendation and adoption of standards related to abortion in the essential benefits package. QHBP plans can still provide coverage for abortions in certain circumstances allowed by federal funds. The Stupak Amendment, passed by a vote of 240-194, imposes restrictions on the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962. It prohibits the use of funds for abortions or coverage of abortion in health plans, except in cases of physical danger to the woman or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The Stupak Amendment restricts the use of funds from H.R. 3962 for abortions, except in cases of physical danger to the woman or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. Premium payments with affordability credits or nonfederal funds cannot be used for this coverage. The Stupak Amendment allows nonfederal entities to offer separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. Premium payments with affordability credits or nonfederal funds cannot be used for this coverage. The Stupak Amendment allows nonfederal entities to offer separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, funded independently from H.R. 3962. Additionally, Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. States can receive incentives for implementing alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. H.R. 3962 allows states to receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws that comply with the bill. The law must improve the medical liability system, encourage error disclosure, and maintain access to affordable insurance. The state law should include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and not limit healthcare providers. The state law under H.R. 3962 must enhance the medical liability system, promote error disclosure, and ensure affordable insurance. It should include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and not restrict healthcare providers. An early offer system allows defendants to offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. If no early offer is made, the injured party can pursue a tort claim for both economic and noneconomic damages. The bill proposes an early offer system for economic losses and legal fees in medical malpractice cases. If the offer is declined, the standard of misconduct and proof is raised for the claimant.
