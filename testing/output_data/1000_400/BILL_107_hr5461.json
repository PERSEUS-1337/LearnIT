The regional plan should include population statistics, school enrollment numbers, and locations of elderly, infirm, and disabled persons needing special assistance. Potential targets should also be identified, such as hazardous chemical concentrations, fuel depots meeting EPA thresholds, munitions and explosives concentrations, and other potential targets like nuclear power plants in the region. Debris disposal should also be addressed. The planning activities include analyzing and documenting disaster possibilities, assessing hazards using Geographic Information Systems, and evaluating consequences on life, property, and the environment. Debris disposal locations and potential health hazards for personnel involved are also identified. Planning activities involve analyzing disaster possibilities, assessing hazards with Geographic Information Systems, and evaluating consequences on life, property, and the environment. The regional plan must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and Governor within 12 months of receiving a planning grant. The plan is to be reviewed annually and updated based on threat assessments, trainings, and drills for security purposes.
