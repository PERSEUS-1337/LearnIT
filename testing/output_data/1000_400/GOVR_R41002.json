    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs and changes the benefits produced by a dam. States and local entities play a significant role in M&I water supply development, as recognized in the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal government's role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities taking the lead. The Water Supply Act of 1958 recognizes state primacy in developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes. This act emphasizes cooperation between the federal government, states, and local interests in developing water supplies in connection with various projects. The federal government primarily invests in water resources infrastructure for flood control, navigation, irrigation, multipurpose dams, and diversion facilities through agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Since the 1960s, construction of large federal dams has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on operating existing reservoirs and managing for new objectives, with the Corps authorized by Congress to undertake infrastructure construction. Reservoir planning in recent decades has shifted towards operating existing reservoirs and managing for new objectives, with Congress authorizing the Corps to construct dams and water infrastructure. Each dam and reservoir are operated to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws, with specific purposes outlined in project construction authorizations and subsequent legislation. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose, with Congress providing additional requirements for all Corps facilities. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and Section 6 of the Flood Control Act of 1944. The 1944 authority allows the Corps to provide surplus water for M&I use on a temporary basis. This report does not analyze the Corps' use of the 1944 authority as it is not expected to play a significant future role. The Corps has limited authority under the 1958 WSA and 1944 Flood Control Act to provide M&I water supply. The focus is on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoirs with storage reallocated. The 1944 authority for surplus water is not expected to have a significant future role. Legal issues related to the 1958 WSA are discussed in another report. The Corps' 1958 WSA authority allows for reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for M&I water supply, with limitations requiring congressional approval for major changes. The 1958 WSA authority allows for reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for M&I water supply, with limitations requiring congressional approval for major changes. Reallocation that seriously affects authorized purposes or causes major operational changes needs congressional approval. The Corps developed guidance for this in EM 1165-2-105, with a provision in 1977 for determining when congressional approval is not needed. The Corps developed guidance in 1977 for determining when congressional approval is not needed for reallocation of storage in reservoir projects for M&I water supply purposes. The provision states that reallocations are considered insignificant if they do not exceed 15% of total storage capacity allocated to all authorized purposes or 50,000 acre feet, whichever is less. The Corps developed guidance in 1977 stating that storage reallocations for M&I water supply are insignificant if they are within 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet. Recent attention has been on Corps' discretionary authority and reservoir reallocations, particularly after a federal court decision on Lake Lanier operations. Multiple lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated in 2007, with a court order in 2009 addressing whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes at Lake Lanier. In 2009, a court order addressed whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating storage in Lake Lanier for M&I water supply without congressional approval. The court agreed with Florida, Alabama, and others that the Corps needed authorization for the changes, estimating a reallocation of 260,000 acre-feet since the mid-1970s. The court found that the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating storage in Lake Lanier for M&I water supply without seeking congressional approval. This reallocation amounted to roughly 260,000 acre-feet since the mid-1970s, with operational changes shifting storage from hydropower to M&I supply. The court's order raised concerns about the Corps' reallocation of water at its other facilities. The court found that the Corps exceeded its authority to reallocate water from Lake Lanier for M&I supply, raising questions about reallocations at other Corps facilities. A total of 135 Corps reservoirs have M&I water storage, with 44 reservoirs authorized under the 1958 WSA for less than 640,000 AF. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF at Lake Texoma using discretionary authority. The 1958 WSA serves as the basis for less than 640,000 AF of the Corps' M&I storage. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF at Lake Texoma for M&I use through discretionary authority, with specific congressional approval for some reallocations. A 1985 document approved an 84,099 AF reallocation from hydropower to M&I use at Lake Texoma, with a compensation arrangement in place. The Corps determined that this reallocation would not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes or require major structural modifications. The Corps approved a compensation arrangement for lost hydropower at Lake Texoma, finding it would not harm the lake's purposes or require major modifications. The reallocation exceeded the 50,000 AF limit without congressional approval, except for Cowanesque Lake where it reached almost 30% of storage. This case involved a mix of congressional direction and Corps' discretionary authority under the 1958 WSA. The reallocation of water supply at Cowanesque Lake represents almost 30% of storage and involved a mix of congressional direction and Corps' discretionary authority under the 1958 WSA. This reallocation was mentioned in P.L. 99-88 and evaluated for potential effects on authorized purposes. The Corps evaluates potential effects on authorized purposes before recommending reallocations. Concerns raised by a 2009 court order question if M&I reallocations adequately consider impacts. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in reallocation analyses due to exceeding authorized uses or lack of authorization. The Corps' reallocation analyses are not evaluated in this report. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in the analyses due to exceeding authorized uses or lack of authorization. Unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other Corps facilities are largely unknown. The 2009 court order raised concerns about the Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply. The Corps' operations at Lake Lanier for M&I water supply have been controversial, with a 2009 court order raising concerns about reallocations at other Corps facilities. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation, following the Corps' criteria for discretionary authority. Congress may question the Corps' interpretation and use of this authority. The Corps' operations at Lake Lanier for M&I water supply have been controversial, with concerns raised about reallocations at other Corps facilities. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA mostly align with the Corps' criteria for discretionary authority. Policy issues arise regarding multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and handling unauthorized withdrawals. Congressional scrutiny of the Corps' interpretation and use of discretionary authority is increasing as interest in M&I reallocation grows at federal facilities. The current policies on M&I reallocations at Corps facilities involve decisions on how to handle multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized withdrawals. Questions arise on how to transition reallocations to M&I uses, charging for storage space, and crediting return flows. These policies are part of broader water policy discussions. The federal government faces complex questions regarding M&I water supply at Corps facilities, including how to charge for storage space and credit return flows. These issues are part of broader water policy discussions, such as the federal role in municipal water supply and adapting to potential climate change effects. The wide range of opinions and challenges in enacting changes to federal facility operations complicates addressing these questions. The federal government grapples with complex questions on M&I water supply at Corps facilities, including pricing for storage space and return flows. These issues are part of broader water policy discussions, such as the federal role in municipal water supply and adapting to climate change effects. Addressing challenges in enacting changes to federal facility operations is complicated by differing opinions and the difficulty of implementing significant changes."
