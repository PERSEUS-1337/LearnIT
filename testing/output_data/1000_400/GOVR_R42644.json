    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2013, a decrease of $90 million from FY2012. The overall estimated DHS budget for FY2013 is $681 million below FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a version of the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill with a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a version of the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill with a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million, not including funds for overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. The House later passed H.R. 5855 with amendments. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, providing less than $4 million above the Administration's request for DHS for FY2013. Funding for certain activities was 27% below the requested level, with increases proposed for various DHS programs. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, allowing the federal government to continue operations through March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. It passed the House by a vote of 329-91 on September 13, 2012, and the Senate by a vote of 62-30 on September 22, 2012. On March 26, 2013, the President signed H.R. 933 into law as P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which includes $39.646 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 113-6, allocated $39.646 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. After adjustments and cuts, $38.348 billion in discretionary budget authority was available for DHS to use. The final legislation reduced discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million, leaving $38.348 billion available for DHS to use in FY2013. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, and Appropriations bills. The FY2013 DHS budget information is sourced from various documents including the President's Budget, Congressional Budget Justifications, Appropriations bills, and the final resolution of FY2013 appropriations. Post-sequester funding levels are based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Historical funding data is taken from the Analytical Perspectives volume of the FY2006-FY2014 President's Budget request documents. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan, based on historical funding data from FY2006-FY2014 President's Budget request documents, transferred functions and funding from 22 agencies to DHS. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's appropriations are organized into five titles, covering various offices and agencies such as the Office of Secretary, Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title III of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's appropriations includes funding for various agencies like the National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title IV covers agencies such as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Science and Technology Directorate, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Title V contains general provisions and additional titles may be added for special issues, like emergency appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund. The structure of the bill may vary between House and Senate versions. The FY2012 House full committee mark-up added a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate version had no additional titles. Differences in the structure of subcomponents and accounts were noted in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The congressional budget process determines annual appropriations through two stages. Congress sets spending totals in the annual budget resolution, which are then allocated to appropriations committees. The committees further allocate funds to subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These allocations must not exceed the initial discretionary allocation. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for each bill, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the initial discretionary allocation and can be adjusted during the year. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. The FY2012 appropriations bills were affected by the Budget Control Act, which established discretionary spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was set for security spending, while all other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments are allowed to cover funding for overseas contingency operations/Global War. The Budget Control Act set discretionary spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2012. For FY2013, security spending was capped at $686 billion, while all other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and controlling health care fraud and abuse. The BCA also established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan. The Budget Control Act set discretionary spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2012. For FY2013, the lower levels agreed to in the House-passed budget resolution became the basis for enforcement in the Senate. An automatic spending reduction process was triggered due to deficit reduction legislation not being enacted by the deadline, leading to sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget implemented across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense programs. The sequestration process for FY2013, triggered by the Budget Control Act, required across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal reductions from defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made changes to the procedures in the BCA for FY2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made significant changes to the Budget Control Act of 2011 for FY2013. The joint committee sequester implementation was delayed by two months, with a $24 billion reduction in the sequester amount. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with lowered discretionary spending caps for FY2013 and FY2014. Sequestration under the Budget Control Act was implemented by President Obama on March 1, 2013, with reductions applied at the program, project, and activity level within each account. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are based on the FY2013 DHS operating plan, excluding resources from the FY2013 supplemental appropriation for disaster relief. The FY2013 DHS operating plan post-sequestration numbers are derived from P.L. 113-6, which aims to eliminate any budget authority exceeding spending limits. Section 3001 of P.L. 113-6 includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority, with DHS falling under the latter category. Section 3001 of P.L. 113-6 includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority, with DHS falling under the latter category. The 0.1% across-the-board cut for DHS was made to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits, but final approval rests with the Office of Management and Budget. Section 3004 provides additional across-the-board rescissions to ensure spending limits are not exceeded. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes additional across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority, with OMB having the final say on spending limits. OMB calculated that further rescissions of 0.032% for \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% for \"nonsecurity\" budget authority were necessary to avoid exceeding the limits. The across-the-board cuts in budget authority for DHS and nonsecurity funding are required to reduce discretionary budget authority in the bill. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are not subject to these cuts. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013 are shown in Table 2, with justifications outlined in the BCA playing a role in the appropriations process. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013, compared to FY2012 and the President's request, show adjustments based on BCA justifications. Emergency spending and overseas contingency operations are not capped, while disaster relief is limited under the BCA formula determined by OMB. For FY2013, the allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by OMB to be $11,779 million, fully utilized including $6,400 million from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. Funding details for FY2012 and FY2013 appropriations bills are summarized in Table 3 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. The FEMA Disaster Relief Fund received $6,400 million in funding from P.L. 113-6 for FY2013. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, which was rejected by the House, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise. The House rejected a proposed civilian pay raise, leading to a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither the part-year continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provides resources for it. The breakdown of DHS's budget by component lacks transparency, with varying budgets across different departments. Table 4 and Figure 1 display DHS's pre-sequester discretionary budget authority for FY 2013. The DHS's budget breakdown for FY 2013 is shown in Table 4 and Figure 1, detailing discretionary budget authority by component. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations, while Table 4 reflects rescissions of prior-year budget authority. The impact of the bill's general provisions on budget authority is not included in Figure 1. The discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6 is compared against the bill's budget allocation in the left column, while the right column includes adjustments to the discretionary budget cap under the BCA. Funding provided under these adjustments is not considered appropriations in this report. Figure 1, even with these adjustments, does not fully represent the resources available to individual DHS components, as much of DHS's budget is not from discretionary appropriations. The DHS budget includes funding from various sources, not just discretionary appropriations. For example, TSA and CIS rely on fee income for a significant portion of their budgets. Only a small percentage of CIS's budget comes from direct appropriations. Figure 2 illustrates how much of the DHS budget is funded through non-discretionary appropriations. The DHS budget includes funding from various sources, with TSA and CIS relying on fee income. Figure 2 shows the breakdown of DHS budget funding, including discretionary and mandatory appropriations, as well as non-appropriated resources. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013. The curr_chunk discusses the appropriations for the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, and presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars. The data is not adjusted for inflation or sequestration, and the amounts represent enacted amounts at the start of the next fiscal year's appropriation cycle. The House Appropriations Committee's markup of H.R. 5855 on May 16, 2012 is also mentioned. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up the DHS appropriations bills in May 2012, with the Senate marking up its bill earliest ever. However, the finalized appropriations for the department were enacted later than usual. Figure 3 illustrates the timing of the DHS appropriations bills through the legislative process. The DHS appropriations bill, P.L. 113-6, was enacted later than usual. Title I of the bill provides funding for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The Administration requested $1,279 million for these accounts in FY2013. The House-passed bill proposed $1,020 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $1,102 million. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title I were $1,086 million, a decrease of 15.1%. The House-passed bill proposed $1,020 million, a 20.2% decrease from the requested level and 9.9% below FY2012. The Senate-reported bill suggested $1,102 million, 13.8% below the request and 2.7% below FY2012. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title I were $1,086 million, a 15.1% decrease from the requested level and 4.1% below FY2012. Sequestration further reduced this to $1,026 million for DHS in FY2013. Table 6 shows enacted amounts for Title I components for FY2012, Administration's request for FY2013, House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, enacted level in P.L. 113-6, and post-sequester level of available resources reported by DHS. Departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including OSEM, USM, OCAO, OCHCO, OCPO, OCSO, OCFO, and OCIO. The curr_chunk discusses the various entities that report directly to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including the Under Secretary for Management and its components. It also mentions the funding requests for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. A graphic representation of discretionary appropriations for each DHS element is provided for quick reference. The curr_chunk provides a graphic representation of discretionary appropriations for different elements of DHS, comparing the FY2013 request to the FY2012 enacted appropriations. The total request for departmental management activities in Title I for FY2012 was $724 million, excluding funds for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items proposed for three offices currently funded under the Office of Policy. Program changes included funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman for training programs and policy advice. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs). Program changes include funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman for training programs and policy advice related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. Additional funding was allocated for the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management and the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. Proposed changes under this appropriation include an increase of $441,000 for the transfer of the Directives function to the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management (OUSM), $26 million for salaries and expenses in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), and $10 million for Human Resources Information Technology. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for improvements to the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The Administration requested $55 million for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), with $6.7 million designated for the Financial Systems Modernization effort to implement a new core financial system at the Federal Emergency Management Agency in FY2013. The OCFO is allocated $55 million, with $6.7 million for Financial Systems Modernization. The new financial system at FEMA is crucial for accurate resource tracking. The OCIO is requested $313 million, with $122 million for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including $65 million for data center migration for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The migration aims to consolidate the Department to two data centers. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The total funding recommended for management activities was $627 million, representing a decrease of $97 million from the President's request. The House Appropriations committee recommended a total funding of $627 million for management activities, which was $97 million less than the President's request. This reduction was justified by the committee due to the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Amendments passed during floor consideration further reduced the budget for management by almost $33 million. During floor consideration of the bill on June 6, 2013, several amendments were offered to reduce the budget for departmental management accounts by almost $33 million. The four largest amendments that passed included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and reallocating them to other agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $10 million and reallocate them to agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This resulted in a total reduction of $41 million (18.6%) from the requested level for the USM. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million, resulting in a total reduction of $41 million (18.6%) from the requested level for the USM. Within OSEM, funding of up to $45,000 was recommended for official reception and representation expenses, with $17,000 allocated for international programs. An amendment proposed reallocating these funds to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000, which was agreed upon by a voice vote on June 6, 2012. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. Representative Flake proposed reallocating funds to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000, which was agreed upon by a voice vote on June 6, 2012. OSEM faced provisions withholding appropriated funds until required reports were submitted, and a provision proposed to restrict the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed-wing aircraft until key reports were submitted. Additionally, $5 million in funding for the Office of General Counsel was proposed to be withheld. Funding of $5 million was proposed to be withheld until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation was published. More than $124 million would have been withheld until all required reports were submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million reduction for failure to submit a comprehensive acquisition report on time. Over $29 million would have been withheld from the OCFO account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million reduction (10%) from the requested level for OCPO due to failure to comply with the statutory requirement to submit a comprehensive acquisition report on time. Over $29 million would have been withheld from the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted. The Committee expressed that appropriations liaisons in OCFO should not serve as intermediaries between the committees and department components. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $242 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment. They also allocated $27 million for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities, emphasizing direct communication with relevant components. The House recommended a $125 million appropriation for development and acquisition of IT equipment, software, services, and related activities. The Senate-reported bill provided appropriations slightly less than the President's request for various departments. The Senate-reported bill proposed appropriations for various departments, including OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with decreases compared to the President's request. The total funding for departmental management would have been $655 million, a decrease of $69 million. The bill also highlighted a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The Senate committee report highlighted a requested programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL) at St. Elizabeths, including $1,327,000 to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes. Despite the increase, the recommended budget for OCRCL was down by roughly $1 million from FY2012 levels. Funding for reception and representation expenses was reduced by 15% for FY2012 and proposed to be further reduced by 10% for FY2013. The DHS discontinued funding for its historian and recommended filling the position again using funds from FY2013. Funding for reception and representation expenses was reduced by 15% for FY2012 and proposed to be further reduced by 10% for FY2013. The committee's recommendation included funding for oversight of major acquisitions, recruitment of a skilled workforce, and security measures to safeguard DHS personnel and facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for various offices within DHS due to budget constraints, focusing resources on critical operational missions. The OCHCO would receive $35 million, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in the Salaries and Expenses account. The OCIO would receive $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $248 million appropriation for the OCIO, including $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. This includes $57 million for development and acquisition of information technology equipment, software, services, and related activities, as well as $65 million for data center migration. The committee report highlighted that data center consolidation investment is expected to result in savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, with reductions compared to the President's request. The committee report highlighted that investment in data center consolidation is expected to save nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with reductions compared to the President's request. The total funding for departmental management in Title I is $643 million, representing a decrease of $170 million or 21% from the President's request. Sequestration affected only OCIO funding, with a reduction based on a part-year appropriation provided under P.L. 112-175. The DHS Operating Plan indicated that only OCIO faced funding reductions due to sequestration, calculated against a part-year appropriation under P.L. 112-175. A crediting mechanism outlined in 2 USC 903 was used to reduce sequestration for activities with final FY2013 appropriations below OMB's baseline. P.L. 113-6 directed the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT projects funded by the CIO or multiple components. The Senate's explanatory statement also provided directives. The DHS CIO was directed to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT projects funded under the CIO or by multiple components. The Senate also directed the Secretary to report travel costs, submit a contingency plan for user fee collections, and the USM to provide a Comprehensive Acquisition plan with the President's FY2014 budget proposal. The Secretary must submit a contingency plan to address gaps in user fee collections, and a revised plan within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The USM is required to submit a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with the President's FY2014 budget proposal and provide quarterly updates to the appropriations committees. DHS must report on the implementation of the balanced workforce strategy and justify any insourcing or outsourcing initiatives in the President's annual budget request. The CFO will continue to provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization. The DHS is required to submit a detailed report on the implementation of the balanced workforce strategy to the appropriations committees, along with a justification for any planned insourcing or outsourcing initiatives in the President's annual budget request. The CFO will continue to provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for existing management accounts are outlined in Table 7, reflecting spending cuts relative to FY2012 enacted amounts. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows budgetary resources available after sequestration was applied, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact in some areas. The DHS Plan column reflects the impact of sequestration on budgetary resources available as of April 26, 2013. The House and Senate Appropriations committees identified issues such as separate line items for three offices, new revenue assumptions, late submissions of required plans, and conference spending by the department. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices within the Department of Homeland Security, which was rejected during the legislative process. The House committee raised concerns about the lack of Senate-confirmed individuals heading these offices and stated that the proposal was inconsistent with streamlining the department and reducing administrative overhead. The proposal to establish separate offices within the Department of Homeland Security was rejected during the legislative process. The House committee criticized the lack of Senate-confirmed individuals heading these offices and stated that the proposal did not align with the goal of streamlining the department and reducing administrative overhead. The Senate committee also questioned the need for these offices to operate independently. The Senate committee report criticized the need for standalone offices within the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting that functions could be consolidated within the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget proposed increasing resources through various legislative measures, which were rejected by the House but included by the Senate. The House rejected proposals for an increase in the aviation security fee, authorization for customs fee revenues, and CBP authority for reimbursement agreements. The Senate included all three proposals, noting a potential budget shortfall of $115 million due to unrealistic revenue assumptions. The Senate included proposals for an increase in the aviation security fee, authorization for customs fee revenues, and CBP authority for reimbursement agreements. The potential budget shortfall of $115 million is due to unrealistic revenue assumptions, which the Committee rejects as unrealistic budgeting. The consequences of such proposals are evident throughout the bill, and until they are enacted into law, they will not be considered relevant to appropriations work. The Committee will consider proposals enacted into law for drafting legislation, with the Department updating on progress. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP pilot projects for reimbursable agreements. The House report expressed concern over late submissions of required plans and reports, withholding funding from departmental management accounts. The Department has been late in responding to Congressional direction and submitting statutorily required reports on time. The Department has been late in responding to Congressional direction and submitting statutorily required reports on time, leading to withholding funding from departmental management accounts. The investment plans, expenditure plans, reports, and justifications outlined by the Committee are essential for DHS oversight work, yet many plans have been late, incomplete, or not submitted at all. The Committee has expressed concerns about the Department's delay in submitting required reports and plans, leading to the withholding of funding. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all statutorily required documents are submitted. The Committee expects the Department to comply with statutory requirements for reports and plans, noting that many are over three months late. The Senate bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets until all required documents are submitted. House actions reduced the USM budget, potentially withholding 70% of funds. P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of budgets until all reports due by May 1 are submitted. House floor action reduced the USM budget, potentially withholding 70% of funds. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of budgets until all reports due by May 1 are submitted, including oversight of expenditures and compliance with federal laws on travel and conferences. The Department's Office of Inspector General will report on the effectiveness of procedures for compliance with Federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. Both House and Senate bills include provisions for quarterly reporting on events costing over $20,000, with restrictions on using grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and non-compliant travel activities. The OIG will report on department spending on events over $20,000, with restrictions on using grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and non-compliant travel activities. Reporting requirements align with government-wide direction on spending. Both bills also limit the number of employees attending overseas conferences. The House and Senate bills limit the number of employees attending overseas conferences, with the House capping attendance at 50 employees unless for law enforcement purposes, and the Senate capping attendance at 50 employees per DHS component. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in the DC area. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in the DC area, spread across 45 locations. The fragmentation of headquarters is cited as a major contributor to inefficiencies, leading to a $3.4 billion master plan to unify the department's functions. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters is spread across 45 locations in the DC area, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. A $3.4 billion master plan with the General Services Administration aims to create a new unified DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, funded by $1.4 billion from DHS and $2 billion from GSA. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far, with Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, nearing operational status. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths is funded by $1.4 billion from DHS and $2 billion from GSA. $1,366 million has been invested so far, with Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, nearing completion. The Administration has requested $89 million for related activities, including a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. The Administration requested $89 million for activities related to the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, including a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. This funding request is not typically funded through Homeland Security appropriations but through the General Services Administration or Department of Transportation budgets. Additionally, $24.5 million was requested for moving the Coast Guard into its new facility in FY2013. No other funding requests for the DHS consolidated headquarters project were included in the budget submission to Congress. The Administration requested $24.5 million for moving the Coast Guard to a new facility in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or St. Elizabeths project through the Homeland Security bill. The bill would have provided funding for the Coast Guard's move and $10 million for additional support. The Homeland Security bill would have provided funding for the Coast Guard to move to a new facility, with an additional $10 million for support. The Committee recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, but included funding in the Coast Guard appropriation for the move to St. Elizabeths and to ensure completion of the current project. The Committee is providing additional funding for the Coast Guard headquarters move to St. Elizabeths, including support for current project completion, site access improvement, and planning adjustments. The Department is exploring lease modifications to address delays in permanent headquarters construction. The Committee encourages progress updates within 90 days and includes $10 million for Coast Guard improvements. The Committee is providing additional funding for the Coast Guard headquarters move to St. Elizabeths, including support for current project completion, site access improvement, and planning adjustments. The Department is encouraged to continue efforts and provide progress updates within 90 days. $10 million is allocated for Coast Guard improvements. The new DHS headquarters project has been underfunded, lacking $89 million for site access improvements. The minority views on the new DHS headquarters project highlight the lack of $89 million for site access improvements, leading to schedule delays and increased costs. The bill only funds the Coast Guard relocation in 2013, with no funding for Phase 2 construction. Amendments addressing DHS headquarters consolidation were not considered, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for highway improvements. The bill only funds the Coast Guard relocation in 2013 for the next 3-5 years. No funding is provided for Phase 2 construction or DHS headquarters consolidation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for highway improvements, but it was funded through a general provision, not as a stand-alone appropriation. Funding for the Coast Guard's move was recommended under Coast Guard operating expenses, not through the construction budget. An attempt to use the $89 million for an unrelated amendment failed. The committee recommended full funding for the Coast Guard's relocation under operating expenses, not through the construction budget. An attempt to use $89 million for a highway interchange as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed. The funding remained in the reported version of the legislation, with requirements for expenditure plans and quarterly briefings. The Under Secretary for Management is required to submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing the allocation of funds for headquarters consolidation. Quarterly briefings on consolidation activities are mandated, with an updated plan being developed to complete the project in smaller segments. The plan is expected to be completed by the end of summer 2012. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the General Services Administration to complete the headquarters consolidation project in smaller, more manageable segments. $29 million is provided for necessary expenses related to the project, with an updated plan expected to be completed by the end of summer 2012. $29 million is allocated for necessary expenses to plan, design, construct, renovate, and equip the department headquarters project and associated mission support consolidation. The funds support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) within the Department of Homeland Security. I&A manages the DHS intelligence enterprise, collects, analyzes, and shares intelligence information with various partners. OPS develops and coordinates operations within the department. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) manages the DHS intelligence enterprise and shares intelligence information with partners. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) develops and coordinates departmental operations. The FY2013 budget request for Analysis and Operations was $322 million, a decrease from the previous year. OPS manages the National Operations Center, a hub for incident management and coordination. The FY2013 request for the Analysis and Operations account was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from the previous year. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The recommendation was $21 million less than the FY2012 level. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying certain proposed increases and decreases in funding. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying proposed increases in executive service salaries and funding for certain elements, while the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease from the previous year but an increase from the President's request. The Senate also required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013, focusing on I&A's unique expertise and continuing briefings on the State and Local Fusion Centers program. P.L. 113-6 provided $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, falling between the amounts in H.R. 5855 and S. 3216, and was the same as the President's FY2013 request. The Committee directed I&A to continue semi-annual briefings on the State and Local Fusion Centers program. P.L. 113-6 allocated $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, aligning with the President's FY2013 request and representing a 4.7% decrease from FY2012. Concerns have been raised by some Members of Congress about I&A's mission. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and vague authorities. Representative Sue Myrick highlighted these issues during a House committee hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence discussed DHS's intelligence mission based on a report by the Aspen Institute. The report recommended that DHS focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, rather than duplicating efforts of other agencies in general terrorist analysis. The intelligence mission of DHS should focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, rather than duplicating efforts of other agencies. The language in S.Rept. 112-169 highlighted concerns about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by other federal agencies. The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The OIG requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states that received FEMA grant funds under the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $2.6 million in new funding to conduct audits of states that received FEMA grant funds. The House-passed bill included $109 million for the DHS OIG, with concerns raised about communication and coordination issues with border corruption investigations. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the DHS OIG, but $10 million was deducted due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. $24 million of the OIG's budget was funded through a transfer from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the DHS OIG, $21 million less than the President's request. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million expected to come from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. Additional funding was designated for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE, as well as completing audits mandated under P.L. 110-53 by the August 20, 2014 deadline. The DHS OIG received $121 million in net budget authority for FY2013, with a $4 million increase from the previous year. Sequestration reduced the OIG budget authority by roughly $7 million. Additionally, there was a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund to align the gross budgetary resources with the request.

This was reiterated in Section 565 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. The explanatory statement notes that the language carried in the House and Senate reports \"should be complied with and carry the same emphasis as the language included in the explanatory statement,\" unless the act or explanatory statement specifically negate that report language. The explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 113-6 emphasizes compliance with House and Senate report language for the DHS OIG, with no additional funding allocated for new tasks. Concerns were raised about the OIG's organizational structure hindering independence and timely reporting, prompting a GAO review. The Senate explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 113-6 expressed concerns about the organizational structure of the DHS OIG hindering independence and timely reporting. GAO was directed to review how the OIG reports its audit results and investigate whether reporting functions comply with independence standards. The OIG's large number of senior positions filled by officials in acting roles may also impede its ability to fulfill its duties. The DHS OIG has a large number of senior positions filled by officials in acting roles, which may hinder its ability to fulfill its duties. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies such as CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The requested budget for these accounts in FY2013 was $30,759 million, with slight variations in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title II amounted to $31,267 million. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 provided $31,267 million for Title II, which was reduced to $30,184 million after sequestration. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills had slight variations in funding levels compared to the requested amount. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, preventing entry of terrorists and illegal goods. They enforce over 400 laws at the border to prevent illegal entries. CBP officers inspect people and goods at ports of entry to determine authorization for entry into the United States. They enforce over 400 laws to prevent illegal entries, with major programs including Border Security Inspections, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. See Table 8 for agency-level details and Table 9 for funding information for CBP appropriations. The curr_chunk discusses funding numbers for various agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, reflecting spending cuts and the impact of sequestration. The \"DHS Plan\" column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources. The Department of Homeland Security's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, does not represent a final funding level. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million over the enacted FY2012 level.

Program changes included transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP and increasing funding for various initiatives. Decreases were seen in the Office of Air and Marine Interdictions, management and administration staffing, fleet acquisition, information technology infrastructure, and nonintrusive inspection operations and maintenance. The House approved a decrease in funding for CBP in various areas, including fleet acquisition, information technology infrastructure, nonintrusive inspection operations, officer overtime expenses, field support staff salaries, Air and Marine salaries, training expenses, and transportation program. The total net budget authority approved was $10,172 million. The House approved a decrease in funding for CBP in various areas, including salaries and expenses, training expenses, and transportation program. The net budget authority approved was $10,172 million for FY2013. The House approved a decrease in funding for CBP in various areas, including salaries and expenses, training expenses, and transportation program. The net budget authority approved was $10,172 million for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million (3.0%) from last year's appropriation and of $109 million (1.1%) from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill included $11,971 in gross budget authority, which would have been a $319 million increase over last year's level and a $283 million decrease from the President's request. Amendments were made to add funding for CBP salaries and expenses, BSFIT account for communications infrastructure, and cut BSFIT appropriation for environmental mitigation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million (3.0%) from last year's appropriation and of $109 million (1.1%) from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill included $11,971 in gross budget authority, which would have been a $319 million (2.7%) increase over last year's appropriation. After the across-the-board cuts but prior to applying sequestration, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $201 million (0.02%) from last year's appropriation. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with a slight increase from last year's appropriation and the President's request. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by approximately $575 million, according to the DHS FY2013 expenditure plan. Policy issues related to CBP, such as the US-VISIT program and staffing, were discussed during the FY2013 appropriations cycle. The FY2013 budget for CBP is projected to be $11,298 million, $353 million less than FY2012. Policy issues include US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, reimbursement authority, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated an entry-exit data system for foreign visitors in 1996. The entry-exit system, mandated by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, tracks the arrival and departure of foreign visitors to the United States by collecting biographic and biometric information. This data is stored in DHS databases and shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. The system has been operational at U.S. ports of entry since December 2006. The Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) database stores biometric data shared with government agencies to identify potential risks. Non-citizens entering the US must provide biometric data, but the system does not collect data from those exiting. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system. The biometric exit system does not collect data from non-citizens leaving the US. The FY2013 budget did not fund this system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. Air and sea carriers provide passenger manifest data to DHS for checks against immigration databases to identify overstays. The integrated U.S.-Canadian system involves sharing biometric data with Citizenship and Immigration Canada. The entry-exit system integrates U.S. and Canadian biometric records for border security. High-priority overstays are flagged for investigation. Congress has pushed for a comprehensive exit system, but its place in the DHS structure has changed multiple times. The biometric exit system has faced challenges in implementation, with Congress expressing frustration over its delay. The system's organizational structure within DHS has undergone multiple changes, initially falling under the US-VISIT Program and later proposed to be part of a Screening Coordination Office that was never funded. The US-VISIT program underwent organizational changes within DHS, including being transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate in FY2008. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies, but the move was not fully supported by Congress. In FY2013, a proposal was made to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE to identify operational and cost efficiencies. Congress did not fully support this move. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD under P.L. 113-6. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, with concerns raised about staffing levels and infrastructure investments. The House report encouraged CBP to consider inspection fee increases. The Senate and House reports raised concerns about DHS staffing levels and infrastructure investments. The House report suggested various changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, and technology utilization. Additionally, the House report called for a specific staffing and deployment plan for border patrol agents, while the Senate report requested a plan for OFO. The House and Senate reports address concerns about DHS staffing levels and infrastructure investments. Efforts to meet staffing demand include public-private partnerships, expanding trusted trade programs, and using technology to increase officer efficiency. There are calls for specific staffing and deployment plans for border patrol agents and OFO at Northern Border ports of entry. Some disagree with reducing CBP staffing despite increases in border patrol agents and OFO officers since FY2005. Some argue for increased CBP staffing to enhance security and facilitate legal admissions at ports of entry, as officers are seen as more effective than automated systems. Increased enforcement between ports of entry may push illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through ports of entry. With sequestration in effect, DHS warned of furloughs for CBP personnel, reduced overtime, and hiring cuts. Measures to minimize impact include eliminating performance awards, reducing contracts, and working with appropriators to reprogram funds. DHS plans to minimize sequester impact on frontline operations by cutting work hours equivalent to reducing Border Patrol and CBP officers. Measures include eliminating performance awards, reducing contracts, and reprogramming funds. CBP intends to rely on reduced overtime and hiring freezes to avoid employee furloughs. Specific plans for frontline staffing adjustments had not been announced at the time of the report. CBP's budget is mostly allocated to salaries and benefits, with plans to reduce overtime hours and furlough days for frontline staffing. The administration is exploring public-private partnerships for funding, despite restrictions on fee-for-service immigration and customs services. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five public-private partnerships in FY2013. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to reimburse for additional services at POEs, new facilities, and expansion at land ports of entry. CBP collects user fees for customs services, known as COBRA fees, under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a758c(f)(1)-(3). CBP collects COBRA fees at land ports of entry to reimburse for customs services, including overtime compensation, benefits, and officer salaries. Merchandise processing fees are deposited in CBP's Customs User Fee Account for additional customs revenue functions, subject to appropriations acts. The COBRA fees collected by CBP are used for various purposes such as premium pay for officers, preclearance services, and foreign language proficiency awards. Some fees are deposited in the Customs User Fee Account for customs revenue functions, subject to appropriations acts. Congressional interest has been drawn by recent examples of COBRA passenger fees being collected without a corresponding appropriation for customs functions. Two recent examples of Congressional interest involve changes in passenger fees under the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011. These changes resulted in significant increases in fees collected from passengers entering the United States, with funds directed to the Customs User Fee Account for customs functions. The NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 led to increased passenger fees for travelers from Mexico, Canada, and other Western Hemisphere states. This resulted in a rise in COBRA fees, with funds directed to the Customs User Fee Account. Questions have been raised by some Members of Congress about the allocation of these fees, prompting the House Appropriations Committee to request a report from CBP on the disposition of the funds. The House Appropriations Committee has raised questions about the allocation of fees collected by CBP. The committee directed CBP to report on the $639 million identified by GAO and how the department plans to eliminate those funds from its books. There was a shortfall in CBP's budget for officer salaries and expenses due to fees collected under P.L. 112-42 not being made available to CBP. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to officer salaries and relying on increasing fee revenues to fill the gap, while the Senate awaited a resolution from the department. P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million to address the budget shortfall in CBP. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to officer salaries to address a budget shortfall. The Senate awaited a resolution from the department, and P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million for CBP salaries. DHS uses technology to monitor the Southwest Border for illegal entries. The Southwest Border utilizes technology for monitoring and detecting illegal entries. Previous initiatives have faced challenges in delivering desired surveillance levels, with programs like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net criticized for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan in 2011, focusing on rapid deployment of existing technology. The Obama Administration replaced the criticized SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan in 2011, emphasizing rapid deployment of existing technology. House and Senate reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new plan, citing delays in procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment. The House and Senate reports criticized DHS for delays in implementing the new border surveillance plan, specifically noting the lack of new surveillance equipment procured by CBP. Both chambers recommended fully funding the President's request for the BSFIT account but also called for rescinding unobligated balances, with the House proposing $40,412,000 in rescissions and the Senate proposing $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP utilizes manned and unmanned aircraft in addition to ground-based surveillance. The House and Senate recommended rescinding unobligated balances from the border surveillance account, with amounts of $40,412,000 and $92,000,000 respectively. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP uses manned and unmanned aircraft for border surveillance, with the President's FY2013 budget supporting 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and surveillance activities. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. As of November 2012, CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems. The \"Big Pipe\" project received $3 million to transmit real-time video and data from aerial assets. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems, with 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support aircraft for border surveillance, but concerns remain about privacy and cost effectiveness. The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in border security is controversial due to privacy concerns and questions about cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for lacking adequate support resources. Both appropriations committees recommended budget increases for upgrading the OAM fleet and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of about $284 million. The House and Senate recommended budget increases for upgrading the OAM fleet and supporting UAS operations, with P.L. 113-6 appropriating about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations. This included a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials, as mandated by the SAFE Port Act of 2006. CBP is responsible for screening cargo passing through U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. The 100% scanning requirement has raised questions about balancing security benefits against potential challenges. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano notified Congress in May 2012 of her decision to extend the 100% scanning deadline for U.S.-bound cargo. The debate revolves around balancing security benefits with the costs and logistical challenges of implementing such scans. Some suggest focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to optimize resources and facilitate legal trade. The Department is considering focusing scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to optimize resources and facilitate legal trade. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to screening programs for security threats. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported these programs. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations. They are also responsible for locating and removing aliens who have overstayed visas or entered illegally. Additionally, ICE works on combating terrorist financing. ICE is responsible for investigating and enforcing violations of immigration laws, including alien smuggling and hiring unauthorized workers. They also locate and remove aliens who have overstayed visas or entered illegally. ICE develops intelligence to combat terrorist financing and enforces export laws. Funding numbers for ICE reflect spending cuts compared to previous years. ICE's budget for FY2013 saw a decrease in funding compared to FY2012, with a requested net budget authority of $5,332 million, representing a 3.9% decrease. The gross budget authority for ICE in FY2013 was $5,644 million, a 3.7% decrease from FY2012. The budget request included a $40 million increase for expansion. The FY2013 budget request for ICE included a $5,332 million net budget authority, a decrease of $218 million (3.9%) from FY2012. The gross budget authority was $5,644 million, with increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel consolidation, video conferencing, and US-VISIT Program, and reductions for the 287(g) program and Office of Principle. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a net budget authority of $5,474 million for ICE in FY2013, with reductions in funding for various programs including 287(g), Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. This represented a decrease of $77 million (1.4%) from the FY2012 enacted level and an increase of $142 million (2.7%) over the Administration's request. In FY2013, ICE would have received $5,786 million in total funding authority from the House-passed H.R. 5855, a decrease of $77 million (1.3%) from FY2012 enacted level and an increase of $142 million (2.5%) over the Administration's request. The Senate-Reported S. 3216 recommended $5,330 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease of $2 million (less than 0.1%) from the Administration's request and a decrease of $220 million (4.0%) from FY2012 enacted amount. In FY2013, ICE's funding from the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) was $5,426 million, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from the previous year's appropriation and an increase of $94 million (1.8%) from the President's request. This amount includes $5,738 million in gross budget authority, which is a $125 million (2.1%) decrease from the previous year's appropriation and a $94 million increase (1.5%) over the President's request. ICE's FY2013 budget was $5,426 million, a decrease of $125 million from the previous year and an increase of $94 million from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced the budget by $200 million. ICE faces challenges in allocating resources effectively to fulfill its mission due to the wide range of civil and criminal violations it handles. ICE's FY2013 budget was $5,442 million, $420 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. Resource allocation for ICE's diverse activities is a debated issue. Part of ICE's mission involves locating and removing deportable aliens, with an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the US. ICE's mission involves locating and removing deportable aliens, with an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the US. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year, leading to ongoing debates on how to prioritize removal. Amendments in H.R. 5855 aim to direct ICE's immigration enforcement priorities, with funds allocated to identify and remove aliens convicted of crimes. Several amendments in H.R. 5855 directed ICE's immigration enforcement priorities, allocating funds to identify and remove aliens convicted of crimes. $1,600 million was made available for this purpose, prioritizing the removal of aliens by the severity of their crimes. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings and ensures their departure from the United States, although concerns have been raised about insufficient detention space. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is responsible for managing custody of aliens in removal proceedings and ensuring their departure from the United States. Concerns have been raised about insufficient detention space, leading to decisions on which aliens to release possibly being based on space availability rather than individual case merits. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and more proportional treatment. The number of detention beds maintained by ICE has been a contentious issue, with a reduction in bed space requested in the President's FY2013 budget. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings. Concerns about insufficient detention space have led to decisions on which aliens to release possibly being based on space availability rather than individual case merits. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and more proportional treatment. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a reduction in bed space requested in the President's FY2013 budget. In 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees due to operating under a continuing resolution and upcoming reductions required by sequestration. Critics viewed the release as political pressure on Congress. ICE Director John Morton stated that despite funding for 34,000 beds, ICE's daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including those not required to be detained by law. Critics viewed the release of detainees as a political move to pressure Congress to avoid sequestration reductions. ICE's Alternatives to Detention program offers less restrictive options, such as electronic monitoring, for certain aliens who do not need secure detention settings. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive options, such as electronic monitoring, for aliens with final orders of removal who do not require secure detention settings. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases funding for the ATD program by $19 million. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is requesting resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. They have the resources to identify 282,000 more removable aliens in FY2012 than in FY2010, including 73,000 Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators support the expansion of Secure Communities. The expansion of Secure Communities has received strong support from appropriators, who would have allocated a similar amount as requested by the Administration for FY2013. There is debate surrounding the involvement of state and local law enforcement in immigration enforcement, with concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. ICE plans to discontinue the least productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active and will not consider any requests for new 287(g) task forces. Senate-reported S. 3216 would have appropriated $51 million for 287(g) agreements while H.R. 5855, as passed by the House, would have funded the 287(g). ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in Secure Communities jurisdictions and will not consider new task forces. Funding for the 287(g) program was set at $68 million in FY2012, with a provision in P.L. 113-6 to maintain this level. ICE also established the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about agency operations and policies. ICE established the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about agency operations and policies. However, some argue that the program is not productive and is not a proper use of ICE resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits the use of funds to support the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, created in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the U.S. to ensure the freedom of movement for people and goods. The TSA, established in 2001, is tasked with safeguarding air, land, and rail transportation systems in the U.S. against terrorist threats. It was transferred to DHS in 2002 and is responsible for deploying security measures such as passenger and baggage screeners, detection systems, and other technologies. Additionally, TSA assesses the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets and enforces security regulations. The TSA is responsible for safeguarding air, land, and rail transportation systems in the U.S. They deploy security measures such as passenger and baggage screeners, detection systems for explosives and weapons, and other security technologies. TSA also assesses the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets, issues regulations to improve security, and enforces these regulations. The TSA budget is complex, with net direct discretionary appropriations shown in the graphic above, but this represents only a portion of the available budgetary resources. The TSA's budget is complex, with net direct discretionary appropriations shown in a graphic. Additional budgetary resources come from airline security fees, transportation threat assessment fees, and credentialing fees. The President's request included a gross budget authority of $7,645 million for TSA, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. Table 11 breaks down TSA's total budget resources, including direct appropriations and non-appropriated sources. The President's request proposed $7,645 million in gross budget authority for TSA, offset by $2,515 million in fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represents a 2.5% decrease in gross funding from FY2012, with a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. $5,099 million was allocated for aviation security, a 3.0% decrease from FY2012, while $124 million was proposed for Surface Transportation Security, a 7.8% decrease from the previous year. The President's request proposed decreases in funding for Surface Transportation Security, including reductions in procurement for baggage and checkpoint technologies, maintenance costs, and the FFDO program. However, funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase by $68 million (33%) under the request. The President's request includes a reduction in funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and flight crew training, as well as various management efficiencies. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase by $68 million (33%), with adjustments to the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) based on industry turnover. Funding levels for Transportation Security Support and the Federal Air Marshals Service would decrease. The requested funding levels for Transportation Security Support and the Federal Air Marshals Service were decreased in the budget proposal. The House-passed bill included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million for TSA, which was a decrease from the administration's request. The House also rejected proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees. The House-passed bill included a $147 million decrease in gross funding for aviation security, rejecting proposed increases in passenger security fees. Appropriations for aviation security actually rose $58 million above the Administration's request. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in workforce costs and baggage detection equipment procurement. Surface transportation security received $126 million, $2 million above the request but $8 million less than the FY2012 enacted amount. The House-passed bill specified reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. It allocated $126 million for surface transportation security, $193 million for direct appropriations and $80 million in fee collections for TTAC. However, it specified $929 million for transportation security support, $880 million for FAMS, citing budget shortfalls due to proposed passenger security fee increases not enacted. The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, offset by $2,715 million in collections. The House committee noted reductions in requested funding for TSA, with a $50 million shortfall due to proposed passenger security fee increases not enacted. The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with a $211 million reduction in net appropriations. This included $5,087 million for aviation security, $11 million less than requested. The Senate accepted the proposed increases in passenger security fees, incorporating $315 million in revenue projections into the offset. The Senate bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. This included cuts to checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The FFDO program received $24 million, $12 million above the request. The Appropriations Committee report cited unobligated prior-year balances for reductions in funding for explosives detection systems procurement and screener staffing. The FFDO program received $24 million, $12 million above the request. TSA's total budget authority was $7,551 million, $290 million less than FY2012, with sequestration further reducing it by $339 million. The projected spending for TSA in FY2013 was $7,212 million, $629 million less than FY2012. The TSA budget authority for FY2013 was reduced by $629 million compared to FY2012 levels, with sequestration further cutting it by $339 million. The department projected total spending to be $7,212 million, with passenger security fees set at $2.50 per flight segment. The department is considering transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. Passenger security fees are currently set at $2.50 per flight segment, not exceeding $5.00 per one-way trip. There are discussions about changing the fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, which could double the fee on direct flights. Airlines are concerned about the potential impact on passenger air travel. The Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights. This change was estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported this proposal to increase fee collections to $5.00 per one-way trip. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip for FY2013, with all fees going towards aviation security. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional limitations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed increasing passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip for FY2013, with fees allocated to aviation security. However, the House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal due to jurisdictional limitations. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees, but TSA identified over $100 million in savings through improved management efficiencies compared to FY2012. TSA identified over $100 million in savings through improved management efficiencies compared to FY2012, raising oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. Efficiency improvements are seen as crucial in addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA, with initiatives like the PreCheck trusted traveler program and modified screening procedures for children. Efficiency improvements are crucial for addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA. Initiatives like the PreCheck trusted traveler program and modified screening procedures for various groups aim to enhance screening efficiencies and potential savings. The PreCheck program is a cornerstone of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after similar CBP programs. The PreCheck program is a key part of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry. It is currently on trial for members of trusted traveler programs, frequent flyer programs, and military members at select airports. Expansion is planned for FY2013, with support from both House and Senate committees for its rational risk-based approach to screening. TSA plans to expand the PreCheck program in FY2013, supported by House and Senate committees for its risk-based screening approach. The Senate committee directed TSA to report on expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. Additionally, the Senate committee urged TSA to expand the known crew member pilot program to include flight attendants. The Senate committee expressed concern about TSA's known crew member pilot program being limited to pilots and proposed expanding it to include flight attendants. TSA's efforts in behavioral-based observation and screening of passengers have faced scrutiny, with the House committee questioning the effectiveness of Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) and calling for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for their deployment. The House committee report did not support increasing the number of Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) due to TSA's lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. They called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. The budget justification proposed a significant reduction in funds for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and crew member self-defense training, but this proposal has not been adopted by the House or Senate Appropriations Committee. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the FFDO program at FY2012 levels and passed an amendment to increase funding by $10 million. This increase is offset by reductions in other areas. The House also directed the TSA to reconsider the use of FFDOs and other law enforcement assets on commercial aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funding for the FFDO program by $10 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee also disagreed with reducing FFDO funding and recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs. This slight decrease compared to FY2012 reflects the constrained budget environment. The FFDO and crew member training programs were fully funded at $25 million under P.L. 113-6, but subject to sequestration cuts reducing spending to $23 million in FY2013. The Coast Guard, lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, performs missions including search and rescue, marine environmental protection, and aids to navigation. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard, $257 million less than FY2012. The Coast Guard, transferred to DHS in 2003, received $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations, $257 million less than FY2012. The House and Senate proposed additional funding for capital acquisitions, including vessels and aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended about $282 million more than the President requested for the Coast Guard's capital account, including acquisition of vessels, aircraft, and improvements to shore facilities. P.L. 113-6 provided USCG with $10,400 million in total gross budget authority, $68 million more than FY2012 enacted level, but sequestration reduced it by roughly an additional $268 million. The USCG received $10,400 million in total gross budget authority from P.L. 113-6, $68 million more than FY2012 enacted levels. Sequestration further reduced the budget by $268 million, resulting in projected spending of $10,132 million for FY2013. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan outlined funding levels for USCG operating expenses and acquisition functions. The \"DHS Plan\" column in Table 13 shows budgetary resources available after sequestration, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate impacts. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows the department's assessment of budget resources available after sequestration, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate impacts. The largest differences in FY2013 funding recommendations were for vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House and Senate bills funded more vessels and aircraft. The House and Senate bills funded more vessels and aircraft than the President's request. The House provided funds for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and two MH-60 helicopters, while the Senate requested funds to build four Response Boat Medium vessels. The President did not request funds for additional Response Boat Medium vessels or MH-60 helicopters, but did request funds for a long-range aircraft in the DOD's budget. The DHS's sequestration operating plan allocated $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions. The House and Senate bills funded more vessels and aircraft than the President's request. The House provided funds for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and two MH-60 helicopters, while the Senate requested funds to build four Response Boat Medium vessels. The DHS's sequestration operating plan allocated $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for one national security cutter, $319 million for six fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. The Coast Guard's effort to replace or modernize its fleet of vessels has been a major issue for Congress over the last several years. The House bill would have provided $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation. The House bill allocated $181 million for aircraft acquisitions, with $86 million specifically for long-range aircraft. Congress has been focused on replacing or modernizing the Coast Guard's fleet of vessels. The House provided $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, including $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for a new headquarters building in Washington, DC. The final funding for housing and aids to navigation was reduced to $29 million according to DHS's sequestration plan. The Coast Guard received funding for aircraft acquisitions and housing/aids to navigation. The House Appropriations Committee called for implementing card readers for TWIC and requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports in response to a critical GAO report. The U.S. Secret Service has two main missions: criminal investigations and protection, with a focus on financial crimes, identity theft, and protecting high-profile individuals like the President. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions: criminal investigations including financial crimes, identity theft, and protection of high-profile individuals like the President, Vice President, and their families. They also provide security at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and for foreign missions in the District of Columbia. The USSS has specific missions in the District of Columbia and for designated individuals, such as the DHS Secretary and foreign dignitaries. They are responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and international conferences in the United States. The President designates NSSE, giving the USSS authority to coordinate security with other law enforcement units. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with allocations for protection and investigation missions. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with allocations for protection and investigation missions. The House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, a decrease from FY2012 reflecting reduced demand for presidential candidate protection. The FY2013 USSS appropriation was $1,613 million, a decrease of $54 million from FY2012. This reflected the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and reduced demand for candidate protection. Additionally, $8 million was restored for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and $8 million was allocated for Electronic Crimes programs. The Senate recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the DHS in FY2013, which was $54 million less than FY2012. They also approved $8 million for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and $4 million for priority domestic investigations. Congress ultimately appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013. The Senate Committee approved $1.611 billion for the USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than FY2012. After the sequester, the Service plans to spend $1.527 billion, with $84 million reduced from its protection and investigation mission. The DHS assessment of budgetary resources is outlined in Table 14. The Secret Service's funding levels for FY2013 under the DHS Plan after sequestration were outlined in Table 14. Congress may need to address the balance between the Service's protective and investigative missions, with the protection mission receiving more resources and attention. The Secret Service's protection mission receives more resources and attention compared to its investigative mission. Congressional action primarily focuses on the protection mission, especially in response to potential terrorist threats and misconduct by agents. Some advocate for expanding the investigative mission to enhance protection efforts. The Secret Service's protection mission has seen increased attention and resources due to potential terrorist threats and misconduct. Some argue that enhancing investigative efforts could improve protection. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with proposed increases for FY2013. In FY2013, the House-passed bill proposed $5,930 million, a 0.3% increase from the requested level and 4.4% above FY2012. The Senate-reported bill suggested $5,971 million, 1% above the request and 5.1% above FY2012. Both versions included $5,481 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. P.L. 113-6 allocated $5,920 million, a 0.2% increase from the request and 4.3% above FY2012, along with $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by a BCA adjustment. The FY2012 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-77) allocated $5,920 million in P.L. 113-6, a 0.2% increase from the requested level and 4.3% above FY2012. It also included $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration proposed moving US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other locations within the Department, while the House proposed keeping some functions within a newly established Office of Biometric Identify Management. The Administration has proposed relocating US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other Department locations. The House suggested keeping some functions within a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities was $1,217 million, $29 million less than FY2012. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities was $1,217 million, $29 million less than FY2012. The IPIS program includes projects on infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and communications. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, with a significant increase directed towards securing federal information systems. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, with a large increase of $278 million (31.3%) from FY2012. The budget increase focused on securing federal information systems, including a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. The $116 million increase in funding for the Network Security Deployment project aims to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) by deploying version 3.0 for active defenses against intrusions and developing version 2.2 for enhanced threat visualization and information sharing capabilities across federal agencies. Additional funding includes $15 million for US-CERT to analyze data generated by NCPS and $5 million for the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to support cybersecurity efforts at state, local, territorial, and tribal levels. The FY2013 budget included increases in funding for the Network Security Deployment project to enhance the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and support analysis of data by US-CERT and the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). However, there were reductions in infrastructure protection and communications funding, with a significant decrease in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. The FY2013 budget included reductions in infrastructure protection and communications funding, with a significant decrease in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. The reduction in infrastructure protection was mainly due to a cut in the budget for the project supporting compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and infrastructure protection projects. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, allocating $45 million for Management and Administration, $1,110 million for IPIS, and $191 million for the Office of Biometric Identity Management. They provided $5 million less than requested for Management and Administration due to concerns about TSA fee increases and poor compliance with statutory requirements. Reductions in the IPIS budget were mainly in the Security Compliance project, following internal reviews revealing implementation issues and unobligated funds. The House proposed reductions in funding for various projects within the NPPD, including $29 million less for the Security Compliance project and $17 million less for the deployment of the NCPS. They also directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and consider alternative security programs developed by the private sector.

Additionally, agencies must submit expenditure plans for cybersecurity improvements, with quarterly reports to OMB and an annual summary to Congress. The Act related to cybersecurity requires federal agencies to submit expenditure plans and quarterly reports on cybersecurity improvements to OMB. OMB then provides an annual summary to Congress. The DHS identified issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program and is reviewing it. Issues for Congress include CFATS compliance problems identified by NPPD and ongoing review, as well as Congress's focus on cybersecurity during the 112th Congress, including various bills addressing information sharing, education, workforce development, and protecting federal information systems. The 112th Congress has focused on cybersecurity, with bills addressing information sharing, education, workforce development, and protecting federal information systems. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service is responsible for the security of federal property and personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for securing federal property and personnel. FPS operations focus on security measures to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures like barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. FPS also supports other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service, at National Special Security Events. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for securing federal property and personnel through various security measures, including emplacement of criminal and terrorist countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. FPS also assists other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service, at National Special Security Events. FPS employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers and administers the services of around 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS, a $40 million increase from FY2012. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million, a $40 million increase from FY2012. FPS's budget is funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants, with $272 million for basic security operations, $509 million for building-specific security operations, and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. House-passed H.R. 5855 and the Senate Appropriations Committee made no specific changes to the FPS budget for FY2013. For FY2013, the FPS budget remained unchanged with no specific changes or additional direction provided by House-passed H.R. 5855 or the Senate Appropriations Committee. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee required a briefing on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. No changes to the FPS budget were recommended in P.L. 113-6, but FPS was directed to update appropriations committees on progress in implementing GAO recommendations. Sequestration did not impact FPS's overall resource levels due to its budget structure. The FPS budget for FY2013 remained unchanged, with Congress expressing concerns over aspects of the FPS mission and funding. Appropriators are interested in improving training for contract guards, federalizing contract guards, developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee. Legislation was introduced in Congress to enhance federal building security. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, aims to enhance federal building security by setting staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expanding the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like the BioWatch program. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 aims to enhance federal building security by setting staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expanding the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like the BioWatch program and received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations, with a requested $166 million for FY2013 to support 101 FTEs. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations and requested $166 million for FY2013 to support 101 FTEs. The proposed allocation includes funding for the BioWatch program, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, $35 million less than FY2012, largely due to a decrease in funding for the BioWatch program. The House-passed bill for FY2013 allocated $132 million for the Office of Health Affairs, $35 million less than FY2012, with significant cuts to the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million, slightly more than FY2012, with recommended funding for BioWatch, Planning and Coordination, Salaries and Expenses, and the Chemical Defense Program. The Senate committee recommended the amounts requested by the Administration for BioWatch, with small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses. $2 million was allocated for the Chemical Defense Program to support additional pilot programs. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2013 reflect decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2013 largely reflect decreased funding for BioWatch, as recommended by the House. The DHS Plan column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact of sequestration in some areas. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding changes for DHS in FY2013, including separating activities related to monitoring WMD threats. They proposed merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate also emphasized the need for coordination in WMD activities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate called for coordination in WMD activities and requested a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including a possible OHA/DNDO merger. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, accounts for the majority of OHA's budget. The BioWatch program, which deploys sensors in U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens, is a major part of OHA's budget. The program has faced challenges in deploying more advanced sensors, known as \"Gen-3,\" due to technical and management issues. The estimated cost of Gen-3 is $5.8 billion, raising questions about its justification. Members of Congress have been monitoring BioWatch performance closely. The BioWatch Gen-3 program has faced technical and management challenges, with an estimated cost of $5.8 billion. Congressional appropriators have sought to limit funding for program expansion, leading to decreased funding in FY2013. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) focuses on reducing loss of life and property from all hazards through various activities, including incident response, recovery, and mitigation assistance to state and local governments. FEMA requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FY2013. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FY2013, primarily for disaster relief and preparedness programs. The Administration also requested an additional $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a slightly lower total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA for FY2013, a decrease from the President's request. The Senate-reported S. 3216 would have provided a higher appropriation of $4,582 million for FEMA for FY2013. Both bills included the requested funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,582 million for FEMA for FY2013, an increase from the President's request and FY2012. The bill also included funding for the Disaster Relief Fund, with adjustments made due to across-the-board cuts and sequestration. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions. The bill includes $6,400 for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for major disaster costs under the Stafford Act, funded by the disaster relief cap adjustment. FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the Budget Control Act. The full range of appropriated resources available to FEMA is not represented in these numbers, as the DRF received additional funding from another source. No authoritative statement has been released on post-sequester funding levels provided by the legislation. The sequester has impacted FEMA's funding levels, with state and local governments facing budget constraints that may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness. President Obama issued a directive in 2011 to address these challenges. President Obama issued a directive in 2011 to develop a national preparedness goal in response to budget constraints impacting public safety and homeland security funding at state and local levels. This directive, known as Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD 8), aims to establish concrete, measurable objectives to mitigate risks posed by specific threats and vulnerabilities, taking into account regional variations. The national preparedness goal, established under Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD 8) in 2011, aims to mitigate risks posed by specific threats and vulnerabilities by defining core capabilities necessary to prepare for incidents that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. This goal supersedes a previous directive issued after 9/11 and focuses on strengthening the preparedness of the United States to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. The National Preparedness Goal, established under Presidential Policy Directive 8 in 2011, aims to strengthen the preparedness of the United States to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. It defines core capabilities necessary for a secure and resilient Nation, focusing on a whole community approach. Since 9/11, additional homeland security grant programs have been added to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), Citizen Corps Program (CCP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), Driver's License Security Grants Program (REAL ID), Operation Stonegarden grant program (Stonegarden), and Regional programs. Since 9/11, several homeland security grant programs have been added to ensure state and local preparedness, including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security, Over-the-Road, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Federal assistance for preparedness activities only makes up a small percentage of overall state and local spending for public safety. Federal grant programs for state and local government homeland security preparedness account for less than one percent of total public safety expenditures, which amount to $218 billion annually. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for FY2013, an increase of $400 million from FY2012. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, an increase of $400 million from FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee denied a request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program due to lack of authorization and details. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program for FY2013 due to lack of authorization, details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns about the proposal, including uncertainty about risk assessments and funding allocation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, an increase of $300 million from FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the consolidation proposal for state and local preparedness grants in FY2013. They recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, $300 million more than FY2012. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs in FY2013. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various grant programs, including Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013.

The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for various grant programs including State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security, Port Security Grants, and education/training/exercises. The budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program was reduced by $77 million due to sequestration, with a projected $1,400 million for state and local programs. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan increased funding for state and local grants program by $77 million, totaling $1,400 million. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer for FEMA's administrative costs, resulting in $132 million higher funding than FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, including $335 million for AFG. The department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, does not represent a final funding level. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. Grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office starting in FY2013. The Administration proposed shifting grant administration to the State and Local Programs office for AFG funding. They also requested legislative language to use SAFER grants for maintaining firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The House-passed bill for FY2009 funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill also proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, including designated funds for program administration and SAFER waiver authority language. The Senate Committee's bill for FY2009 allocated $642 million for firefighter assistance, maintaining separate funding for AFG and SAFER grants. The bill also granted DHS the requested SAFER waiver authority for FY2013 and specified that administrative costs would be covered by the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded annually through regular appropriations but often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to ongoing recovery efforts from major disasters. There has been a reliance on supplemental funding due to underfunding the DRF, leading to arguments for increased regular appropriations. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to ongoing recovery efforts from major disasters, such as the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. There has been a reliance on supplemental funding due to underfunding the DRF. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF through the regular appropriations process for FY2013, a decrease of $1,011 million from the previous year. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) through the regular appropriations process for FY2013, a decrease of $1,011 million from the previous year. The request included $608 million for activities not directly tied to major disasters and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This structure reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing these costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The Administration requested $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FY2013, reflecting the impact of the Budget Control Act. The request was adjusted downward by $1,200 million to account for projected recovery of funds not needed for past disasters. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills carried the same level of funding for the DRF as requested for FY2013. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2013 allocated $7,007 million to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with a $24 million transfer to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits on disaster-related spending. The FY2013 budget allocated $7,007 million to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $24 million designated for audits by the DHS Office of Inspector General. Despite a 5% reduction due to sequestration, the DRF received $918 million more than the Administration's initial request. The Budget Control Act allows for additional budget authority for disaster relief beyond discretionary spending caps. The Budget Control Act (BCA) directs the Office of Management and Budget to calculate an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to prevent sequestration due to exceeding discretionary spending caps. This adjustment provides additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. Funding for \"disaster relief\" under the BCA is distinct from the Disaster Relief Fund and includes funding from various federal accounts. The Budget Control Act defines \"disaster relief\" funding as separate from the Disaster Relief Fund, with funding coming from various federal accounts. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the DRF had access to $7.3 billion, including funds from a continuing resolution and supplemental disaster assistance. Congress approved additional funding due to high demand on the DRF. As a result of P.L. 112-175, the government approved $11,485 million in additional pre-sequester resources for the Disaster Relief Fund through P.L. 113-2, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, to address high demand. The Administration sought emergency funding designations to cover most of the additional disaster assistance requested. The Administration sought emergency funding designations to cover most of the relief exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Stafford Act for disaster relief in FY 2013. The DRF received all available funding for disaster relief under the BCA for the first time. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program, stating it duplicated the work of other mitigation programs. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program, suggesting its duplication of other mitigation programs. It was noted that the program could continue awarding grants for several years with existing unobligated balances. Neither the House-passed bill nor the Senate-reported bill included language ending the program. The Administration proposed phasing out the PDM program due to duplication of other mitigation programs. Despite a large unobligated balance of over $174 million, concerns were raised about the slow pace of awards. The House-passed bill and Senate-reported bill allocated small amounts for the program, signaling a need for improvement in award distribution. Additionally, both chambers planned to rescind funding from unobligated balances, specifically for congressionally directed projects that were not utilized by local communities. The Administration proposed phasing out the PDM program due to duplication of other mitigation programs. Concerns were raised about the slow pace of awards despite a large unobligated balance. Both chambers planned to rescind funding from unobligated balances, specifically for congressionally directed projects that were not utilized by local communities. The post-sequester amount for PDM in FY2013 is just under $25 million, presenting challenges to program administration. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle due to reduced award amounts. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle for the EFS program. The funding levels for FY2013 have been proposed at $120 million by the House and $150 million by the Senate, with a post-sequester funding level of just under $114 million according to the DHS operating plan. The House and Senate have proposed funding levels for the EFS program at $120 million and $150 million respectively for FY2013. The post-sequester funding level is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arise from the program's delayed distribution of funds in FY2012. The EFS assistance distribution for FY2013 is under scrutiny, with proposed funding levels of $120 million by the House and $150 million by the Senate. The enacted amount after sequestration is nearly $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, with varying levels proposed by the Administration, House, and Senate. The USCIS funding levels for FY2013 varied between the House, Senate, and enacted amounts after sequestration. The Senate-reported bill provided $1,535 million, slightly below the request, while P.L. 113-6 allocated $1,520 million, a decrease from the request but above FY2012 levels. USCIS activities include adjudication of immigration petitions and naturalization. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is primarily responsible for adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. Funding for USCIS comes from direct appropriations as well as fee income from the Examinations Fee Account. USCIS funds its operations through direct appropriations and fee income from the Examinations Fee Account. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. In FY2013, the requested USCIS gross budget authority was $3,005 million. The USCIS receives annual direct appropriations for specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-verify program. In FY2013, the requested budget authority was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The direct appropriation included funding for E-Verify, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and the SAVE Program. The FY2013 budget request for USCIS included $20 million for the SAVE Program and $2,862 million in gross budget authority, with $2,391 million for adjudication services, $89 million for information services, and $382 million for administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a gross budget authority of $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections, $31 million less than the requested amount but $9.5 million above FY2012 funding levels. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a USCIS budget of $3,004 million for FY2013, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The proposed amount was $31 million less than requested but $9.5 million above FY2012 funding levels. The Committee directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify, allocated $20 million for the SAVE program, and at least $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. The House Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and at least $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. They also expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions and OIG to assess USCIS actions. The Committee did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting that it should be funded by the Department of Defense. The House Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a budget authority of $2,999 million for USCIS in FY2013, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program, allocating $20 million from user fee revenues instead. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations, with an additional $5 million to be made available for these grants via fees. No direct appropriations were recommended for the SAVE program, with USCIS directed to allocate $20 million from user fee revenues instead. The Committee also directed that no appropriations be used to operate the Office of Citizenship Services and expressed concerns about the costs to administer the Immigrant Integration grant program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations, with an additional $5 million to be made available for these grants via fees. The Committee expressed concerns about the costs to administer the Immigrant Integration grant program and directed that no more than 5% of the grant funding level be used for administration in FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $114 million for the program, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration would reduce this to $109 million. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce USCIS funding to $109 million, a decrease from the requested level of $143 million. The FY2013 budget cycle raised concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, and the USCIS Transformation program. For the FY2013 budget cycle, potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. The House Committee directed USCIS to include operation costs in fee adjustments and to provide quarterly fee revenue briefings. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations, including operation costs like asylum processing, to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. USCIS must continue to brief the Committee quarterly on fee revenues. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains a congressional issue, with $7.5 million allocated from fee revenue and $2.5 million from appropriations in FY2013. The House and Senate Committees stated that program funding for USCIS comes from fee revenue. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 requires USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds in FY2013 for immigrant integration grants. The bill also allocates $2.5 million in appropriations for the grants. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program to convert the application process to an online system. The Committee questioned the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program converting the application process to an online system. Concerns were raised about the $597 million invested from FY2006 to January 2012 with little delivered capability. Congress extended E-Verify authorization for one year to address concerns about work-authorized individuals being falsely identified as ineligible to work. The House and Senate Committees are concerned about the operability of the E-Verify program. The House bill extended E-Verify authorization for one year, while the Senate Committee focused on the cost of expanding E-Verify and its use in the agricultural industry. Implementation challenges in agriculture include non-office-based hiring, limited internet access, seasonal employment, and high turnover. The House Committee supports efforts to increase efficiency and reduce expenses in the E-Verify system. The House Committee supports efforts to increase efficiency, reduce expenses, and digitize immigration records to eliminate paper files. They directed USCIS to convert records to digital format through the Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS) and to brief Congress on progress toward eliminating paper USCIS Form I-94. The House Committee directed USCIS to convert immigration records to digital format through EDMS and eliminate paper USCIS Form I-94. They also urged DHS to review refugee processing for streamlining while maintaining security vetting. The Senate Committee encouraged DHS to use parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs. The Senate Committee urged DHS to use parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs, allocate resources for responding to natural disasters, and highlighted the role of FLETC in providing law enforcement training. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides basic and advanced law enforcement instruction to various federal, state, and local entities, promoting consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers training at multiple sites and online, with a proposed budget of $258 million for the upcoming year. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) collaborates with partner organizations, administering training at various sites and online. The proposed budget for FLETC is $258 million, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriations. The budget cuts were due to efficiencies and deferring construction work. The proposed budget for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is $258 million, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriations. The reduction in expenses was due to efficiencies and deferring construction work. House-passed H.R. 5855 included $256 million for FLETC, with cuts in various areas compared to last year's levels and the requested amount. The House Appropriations Committee cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases as the reason for the reductions in the acquisition budget. The House Appropriations Committee report cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases as the reason for reducing the Acquisition budget by $2 million (6.8%). Senate-reported S. 3216 allocated $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a $1 million decrease from the requested level and $14 million (5.2%) below the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration would further reduce funding to $245 million. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $257 million for FLETC, a decrease from the requested level and below the FY2012 enacted level. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would further reduce funding to $245 million. The Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary DHS organization for research and development, conducting R&D in its own laboratories and funding R&D performed by other entities. See Table 21 for a breakdown of S&T Directorate funding for FY2012 and FY2013. The Science and Technology Directorate conducts R&D in its own labs, funds R&D by other entities, and supports acquisitions for DHS components. The FY2013 budget request was $831 million, a 25% increase from FY2012. The largest increase in funding was for disaster resilience R&D. The FY2013 budget request for the Science and Technology Directorate was $831 million, a $212 million increase from FY2012. The largest increase was for disaster resilience R&D, with a reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. The House-passed bill would have provided $826 million for the S&T Directorate. The FY2013 budget request for the Science and Technology Directorate was $831 million, with plans for an assessment of NBAF. The House-passed bill allocated $826 million, with reductions in RDI funding. The Senate recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request.

The committee directed an increase of $75 million to be spent on NBAF construction. The total cost estimate for NBAF facility is $1.138 billion. The S&T Directorate received $834 million after rescissions, with $28 million less than the request for RDI. The act provides $37 million more than the request for Laboratory Facilities, to be used for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. The S&T Directorate received $834 million, $28 million less than the request for RDI. The act provides $37 million more for Laboratory Facilities, to be used for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate is $801 million. DNDO is responsible for DHS nuclear detection research and development. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is the primary DHS organization for combating the threat of nuclear attack. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 13% above the FY2012 appropriation of $290 million. The request included an increase of $44 million (109.7%) for Transformational R&D, partially offset by a reduction of $23 million (44.3%) for Systems Development. The FY2012 appropriation for DNDO was $290 million, with a request for an increase of $44 million (109.7%) for Transformational R&D. The Administration did not propose transferring this program to S&T as in previous years. The House-passed bill would have provided $316 million for DNDO, $12 million (3.6%) less than the request, with most of the reduction in the Transformational R&D program. The House-passed bill for FY2012 would have provided $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than the request, with most of the reduction in the Transformational R&D program. The bill directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture and advocated for the consolidation of DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO that matched the Administration's request for FY2014. The committee directed DHS to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense to enhance coordination and strategic planning efforts against WMDs. The Senate-reported bill also required DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA was not addressed in the Senate committee report. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO that matched the Administration's request for FY2014. The committee directed DHS to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense to enhance coordination and strategic planning efforts against WMDs.

The act directs DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The explanatory statement does not mention if this should be an annual requirement. DHS is directed to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO that matched the Administration's request for FY2014. DHS is directed to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined for existing program functions. The \"DHS Plan\" column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources. The \"DHS Plan\" column outlines post-sequester funding levels for existing DNDO program functions, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. Title V of the DHS appropriations bill includes general provisions that may offset funding scores, with new provisions discussed in this report having a direct budgetary impact. The Administration typically requests rescissions in specific accounts rather than through general provisions. The report discusses new general provisions with a direct impact on the budget scoring of the bill. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the previous year's DHS Appropriations bill, including rescissions and permanent changes in the U.S. Code. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the previous year's DHS Appropriations bill, including rescissions and permanent changes in the U.S. Code. Eleven provisions were viewed as one-time provisions, while five were deemed permanent changes in the U.S. Code. The Administration also suggested adding five new general provisions, such as extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds. The curr_chunk discusses new provisions in the House-passed H.R. 5855, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify, allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds, establishing an outreach program for dam safety, and making certain fees available for customs inspectors. The bill also includes $292 million in rescissions to reduce the net scoring. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes new provisions such as extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements.

Funding for DHS initiatives like immigrant integration grants and reimbursement of security costs to state and local governments were included in the Senate-reported bill. Federal government spending involves a multi-step process that begins with the enactment of budget authority by Congress. Federal government spending starts with budget authority enacted by Congress, followed by obligations and outlays. Budget authority determines available funds for agencies and may be one-year, multi-year, or indefinite. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more than enacted budget authority. Budget authority enacted by Congress limits federal agencies from overspending. It can be one-year, multi-year, or indefinite, with obligations incurred for personnel, contracts, and services. Outlays represent actual spending during the fiscal year. Multi-year and no-year budget authority allow for spending over a specified or indefinite period. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Outlays represent actual spending during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority can be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year, especially with certain contracts. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded each year in appropriations acts. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws other than appropriation acts. The Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided annually, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, known as direct spending, is not appropriated yearly but some entitlement programs require annual appropriations. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government as part of business transactions, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs that offset discretionary spending, collected through business transactions as negative outlays. These entitlement programs are entitlement programs where eligible entities receive payments as established by law. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. These entitlements are funded by permanent or annual appropriations, as well as offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress. They contribute to the gross budget authority calculation. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, not appropriated by Congress, contribute to the gross budget authority calculation. The federal government has shown increasing interest in homeland security funding since the 9/11 attacks, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism including homeland security analysis. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism, which now includes homeland security analysis. The analysis has become more refined over the years, with distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities becoming more precise. It is important to note that DHS funding does not cover all federal spending on homeland security, as other agencies also contribute to these efforts. The DHS funding for homeland security in FY2012 accounted for 52% of total federal funding, with the Department of Defense at 26%, Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, Department of Justice at 6%, and Department of State at over 3%. These top five agencies collectively made up 93% of federal spending on homeland security. The top five agencies in federal spending on homeland security in FY2012 were the Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, Department of State, and the Department of Homeland Security. These agencies collectively accounted for approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion allocated specifically for homeland security. The FY2012 budget bills allocated $35.1 billion for homeland security within the total DHS budget authority of $52.5 billion. However, inconsistencies exist in the budget figures presented in Table B-1 and throughout the report. The lack of estimates for FY2013 due to P.L. 113-6 and sequestration impact hinders authoritative data availability."
