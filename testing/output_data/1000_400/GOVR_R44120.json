    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee. Congressional staff receive numerous requests for information on these bills. This report highlights personnel-related issues of high interest and compares House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal. This report summarizes key personnel-related issues in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA), comparing differences between House and Senate versions. The President vetoed an earlier version of the bill due to concerns about funding exceeding spending caps. The President vetoed an initial bill, H.R. 1735, due to concerns about defense-related spending exceeding caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The bill was later modified to comply with revised spending caps after the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised the limits for both defense and nondefense spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending in FY2016. The revised NDAA, based on the amended version of S. 1356, was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills in 2015. The amended version of S. 1356, known as the revised FY2016 NDAA, was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills in 2015. Related CRS products provide detailed background information and analysis, with contact information for CRS analysts. Some issues discussed in this report were previously addressed in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 113-291) discussed military personnel issues and authorized active duty end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Congress increased personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but began reversing these increases in anticipation of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased military personnel strength for the Army and Marine Corps. However, these increases were reversed in anticipation of U.S. forces' withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001, with plans to further reduce active personnel strength for the Army and Marine Corps by FY2017. The military personnel strengths for Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force are as follows: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). The Army plans to reduce its active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 by FY2017-2019. The Administration request proposed reductions for the Army but increases for Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to FY2015. The final bill authorized end-strengths similar to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is higher by 3,715. The final bill authorized end-strengths similar to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is higher by 3,715. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would have repealed 10 U.S.C. 691, allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers below authorized levels. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted minimum end-strengths downward and expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to reduce personnel numbers in active and reserve components. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted minimum end-strengths downward for active and reserve components, allowing a decrease of up to 2% below authorized levels. This expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to reduce personnel numbers. Background: The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves in FY2001 were: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000). Between FY2001 and FY2015, significant shifts in authorized end strength occurred in the Navy Reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). Smaller changes were seen in the Air National Guard (-3,022 or -2.8%) and Army Reserve (-3,300 or -1.6%). The Army National Guard and Marine Corps Reserve end strengths remained largely unchanged. For FY2016, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for three components. For FY2016, the Administration proposed reductions in authorized end strength for the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve, while increases were proposed for the Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. The Coast Guard Reserve's authorized strength remained unchanged. The enacted bill matched the Administration's request. For FY2016, the Administration proposed changes in authorized end strength for various military reserves, with increases for the Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. The Coast Guard Reserve's authorized strength remained unchanged in the enacted bill. The focus on military personnel costs and quality remains a key concern for Congress. The military pay raise for 2016 is determined by a formula linked to the Employment Cost Index, with a proposed increase of 2.3%. However, the President's Budget requested a lower raise of 1.3% in line with Department of Defense plans to limit pay increases through FY2020. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%, in line with DOD plans to limit pay increases through FY2020. The House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but emphasized the importance of robust compensation programs for maintaining a high-quality, combat-ready force. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay but emphasized the importance of robust compensation programs for maintaining a high-quality, combat-ready force. The initial Senate version proposed a 1.3% pay raise for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade. The Senate version of the bill proposed a 1.3% pay raise for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade, with a provision to freeze the pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. President Obama set the pay raise for 2016 at 1.3% through invoking 37 U.S.C. 1009(e). President Obama invoked 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the 2016 pay raise at 1.3% for servicemembers. The final bill did not include a general pay raise provision, maintaining the 1.3% increase. However, section 601 of the enacted bill freezes the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. Military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system providing a monthly annuity after 20 years of service. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a commission to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services, with Congress incorporating many of the proposed changes into the enacted bill. The Commission's final report on modernizing pay and benefits for the armed services was delivered to Congress on January 29, 2015. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes changes to the military retirement system, transitioning to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. The new military retirement system transitions to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 are grandfathered into the current system, while those with less than 12 years of service by December 31, 2017 can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments are repealed by this Act.

Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 are grandfathered into the current system, while those with less than 12 years of service by December 31, 2017 can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments are repealed by this Act. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received congressional and media attention, leading to changes in previous NDAAs, with ongoing issues remaining. The issue of sexual assault in the military has garnered congressional and media attention in recent years. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military revealed that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. Social retaliation was reported by 53% of those who experienced unwanted sexual contact, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting an infraction. In 2014, 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact, with 53% facing social retaliation. This included adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting an infraction. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and enhances the Special Victims' Counsel Program. The provisions in P.L. 114-92, S. 1356 address concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault in the military. These provisions also enhance the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modify requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. The background information includes the announcement by then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in 2013 regarding the rescinding of the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion. On January 24, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the rescinding of the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule, allowing women to serve in previously restricted combat occupations. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter later declared that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established requirements for \"gender-neutral\" occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. In December 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established requirements for \"gender-neutral\" occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 and subsequent years directed DOD on their development and application. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat. The FY2016 NDAA emphasized that DOD's performance standards must be related to actual duties in specific military occupations and measure individual capabilities. Changes made by the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shorten the waiting period for Congress to review assignment policy changes related to opening or closing categories for females in the military. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortens the waiting period for Congress to review assignment policy changes related to opening or closing categories for females in the military. This change provides a more definitive timeline for implementation by DOD and reduces the in-session time needed for Congress to review and act on proposed changes. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially affecting readiness. Improving financial literacy could save DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce involuntary separations of troops. Enhancing personal financial management training programs for servicemembers could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce involuntary separations due to financial distress. The enacted bill includes provisions for financial literacy training at various career points and life changes. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires financial literacy training for servicemembers at different career stages and life events. Statutory requirements for enlistment differ between active and reserve components. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires financial literacy training for servicemembers at different career stages and life events. Enlistment requirements include being a national of the United States, a lawful permanent resident, or meeting criteria in the Compact of Free Association. Exceptions can be made for enlistment if deemed vital to national interest. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program is based on this provision. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program is based on the provision that enlistees must be a citizen of the United States, a lawful permanent resident, or have previously served in the armed forces. The enacted bill requires financial literacy training for servicemembers and allows exceptions for enlistment if deemed vital to national interest. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. The Post\u20109/11 GI Bill, approved four years later, offered more generous benefits than REAP. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating REAP, allowing current recipients to exhaust their entitlement. The initial Senate-passed bill adopted the Commission's recommendations by setting a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate-passed bill adopted recommendations to terminate REAP, allowing current recipients to exhaust their entitlement. The bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate-passed bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) contained provisions related to REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Veterans have requested official identification cards to verify their military service. The bill would entitle individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to benefits. For more information, refer to CRS reports RL30802, R42785, and R42755. Contact [author name scrubbed] at x[phone number scrubbed]. The Senate-passed bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) included provisions for REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Veterans have requested official ID cards to verify their military service. The bill would entitle individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to benefits, but the enacted bill did not include a provision for a \"Recognition of Service ID Card.\" The Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to negotiate with national retail chains for reduced prices for veterans. Veterans can use state-issued ID cards to show their veteran status. Honorably discharged veterans can also obtain an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed a law for Veterans Identification in 2015. Veterans can apply for a driver's license or State ID card with veteran status. Honorably separated Uniformed Services members can obtain a military service ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide ID cards to veterans showing military service. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces through incentives like bonuses and educational benefits. Congress has an ongoing interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces through incentives like bonuses and educational benefits. Section 531 of the House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would authorize service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. Section 522 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) incorporated the House provision. The House-passed bill authorizes additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, up to 20% of the fiscal year accession target. Implementation would require a 30-day congressional review. Reservists called into active federal service are eligible for legal protections, including reemployment rights under USERRA. When reservists are called into active federal service, they are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under USERRA. The act allows for reemployment after military service, with exemptions for certain types of duty. Congress created new mobilization authorities for reservists in 2011. The new mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these authorities are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit on military service. Section 565 of the House-passed bill aims to exempt military duty under these new authorities from counting towards the cumulative five-year limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. The new mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these authorities are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit on military service. Section 565 of the House-passed bill aims to exempt military duty under these new authorities from counting towards the cumulative five-year limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. A veteran is defined as a person who served in active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Active service refers to full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also includes periods of active duty for training where injury or death occurred in the line of duty. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in law. Members of the National Guard and reserves who are not activated for active duty military service do not meet the criteria for active service. Members of the National Guard and reserves must have active duty service to be considered veterans. Reservists become eligible for retirement after 20 years of qualifying service, but they are not necessarily veterans unless they have completed the required active service as well. Reservists who complete 20 years of qualifying service are eligible for retirement and retired pay at age 60, but may not be considered veterans without completing required active service. The House-passed bill initially honored reservists as veterans without additional benefits, but the enacted bill did not include this provision. For more information on veterans' eligibility and benefits, refer to CRS Report R42324 and R41386. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) for military personnel to take time off from their career. For more information on veterans' burial benefits and Reserve Component retirement benefits, refer to CRS Report R41386 and RL30802. Contact CRS for further details. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing military personnel to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers by providing career flexibility. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) was initiated to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Participants accept additional active duty service obligations and DOD must submit a final assessment to Congress by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill would remove prohibitions on program participation for certain members of the Armed Forces. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows high-performing servicemembers to take a break and return with an extended service obligation. The enacted bill removes restrictions on program participation for certain members of the Armed Forces. The program aims to improve recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows high-performing servicemembers to take a break and return with an extended service obligation. Congress has been concerned with improving the recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. Some suggest additional incentives for high-performing military personnel in acquisition assignments and enhanced professional military education in acquisition. Military acquisition professionals oversee funding for defense programs, and there is interest in ensuring qualified personnel for acquisition duty. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 created incentives for officers in joint matters tied to promotions and advancement. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 incentivized officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters, tying promotions to joint professional military education and service in joint assignments. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and encourages a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is urged to include acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education. The NDAA encourages a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields, with Phase II joint professional military education including acquisition matters. DOD policies limit carrying government-issued firearms on military bases to personnel on assigned duties. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to regulate firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. Current policies restrict carrying government-issued firearms to personnel on assigned duties, prohibiting personal firearms on bases. Recent active shooter incidents have raised concerns about force protection measures on military installations. The recent attack on a recruiting center and U.S. Naval Reserve Center has raised questions about the adequacy of force protection measures at military installations. A bill has been enacted to give more flexibility to commanders to authorize servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action. A bill aims to give commanders flexibility to authorize servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. On April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people, including six servicemembers. There is debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart due to the nature of the attack. Supporters of Section 583 of H.R. 1735 argue that servicemembers killed in the Oklahoma City bombing should be eligible for the Purple Heart as victims of terrorism. Opponents believe they do not qualify under current law. Eligibility was expanded in the FY2015 NDAA to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX, initially treated as criminal acts. Some argued these acts should be viewed as terrorism due to Muslim perpetrators, while others were concerned about anti-Muslim implications of awarding the Purple Heart in these situations. The NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include attacks by foreign terrorist organizations if the perpetrator was in communication with the organization before the attack and if the attack was inspired by the organization. This provision addresses concerns about awarding the Purple Heart to servicemembers involved in the 2009 shootings at Little Rock and Fort Hood. The law expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include attacks by foreign terrorist organizations if the perpetrator was in communication with the organization before the attack and if the attack was inspired by the organization. However, the provision in Section 583 of the initial House-passed bill was not adopted, meaning servicemembers who were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years with Congress enacting laws related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to end the euthanizing of military working dogs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The Department of Defense practice of euthanizing military working dogs at the end of their useful working life was terminated by Congress. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility for adopting MWDs to include handlers and their family members. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring MWDs to be transferred to the 341st Training Squadron. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring military working dogs to be transferred to the 341st Training Squadron in Lackland, Texas or another location for adoption. Congress passed a provision in Section 342 of the bill requiring the Department of Defense to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas back to the United States for adoption, giving priority to former handlers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs from overseas to the United States for adoption, prioritizing former handlers. Advocates believe this change will facilitate domestic adoption, while opponents cite concerns about the lack of appropriated funds for the transfers. The enacted bill requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs from overseas to the United States for adoption, prioritizing former handlers. Opponents argue that the transfer will be costly due to the lack of appropriated funds for the process. The President's FY2015 and FY2016 budget proposals included cuts to the Defense Commissary System, but funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA. The proposed cuts aimed to reduce subsidies for commissaries, potentially affecting operating days and hours for patrons. The President's FY2016 budget proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, reducing the budget from $1.3 billion to $400 million in three years. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours for commissary patrons and increased costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. Section 651 of the enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report by March 1, 2016, detailing a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by October 1, 2018. This plan must include meeting benchmarks for customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons. Potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, such as privatization or closure, will also be considered. The report due by October 1, 2018, must meet benchmarks for customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons. It will include descriptions of potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, pricing constructs, and the impact on MWR programs. The Defense Secretary will consider previous reports and studies, including Section 634 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The Defense Secretary will consider Section 634 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 and previous reports in a report due by October 1, 2018. The report will review management, food, and pricing options for DeCA, including using variable pricing in commissary stores and converting the defense commissary system to a non-appropriated fund instrumentality. Additionally, a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program is required by Section 652 of the enacted bill. Section 652 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. This report is in addition to the Defense Secretary's review of management, food, and pricing options for DeCA, including the possibility of using variable pricing and converting the defense commissary system to a non-appropriated fund instrumentality. In FY2015, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) released its Final Report, proposing changes to TRICARE health care program for servicemembers. The Administration's FY2016 budget request included replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life program. The Administration proposed replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life program. However, these proposals were not adopted in the final bill, and potential changes to TRICARE benefits may still be considered in the future. The President did not endorse the recommendations of the Modernization Commission for TRICARE reform in H.R. 1735. Congress may consider major changes in the future, but the Senate committee is taking a deliberate approach to understand the implications and unintended consequences. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs within the TRICARE program. The committee recommended provisions in the Act to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs within the TRICARE program. This lays the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future. The joint explanatory statement further emphasized the need for comprehensive reform of the military health care system in fiscal year 2017. The committee recommended provisions in the Act to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs within the TRICARE program. This lays the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future. The joint explanatory statement further emphasized the need for comprehensive reform of the military health care system in fiscal year 2017, focusing on improving access, quality, and the experience of care for all beneficiaries, maintaining medical readiness of health professionals, and ensuring long-term viability and cost effectiveness. Modernizing and improving the military healthcare system will require reevaluating all elements of the current system, including necessary increases to fees and co-pays. To modernize and improve the military healthcare system, reevaluation of all elements including necessary fee and co-pay increases is essential. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to various pharmacy options with different copayment policies. Military pharmacies provide outpatient prescriptions for active duty servicemembers without copayments. Beneficiaries can access a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order, and retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no copayments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies offer a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Non-formulary drugs are generally not available. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and required maintenance drug refills to be filled through lower cost options. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed changes to pharmacy policies. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and required maintenance drug refills to be filled through lower cost options. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed annual increases in copayments for fiscal years 2016 through 2025. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) contains a one-time increase to pharmacy copayments, raising the copay for generic drugs from $8 to $10 and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24 at retail pharmacies. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes a one-time increase in pharmacy copayments for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and by mail order. The copay for generic drugs at retail pharmacies goes from $8 to $10, and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24. Mail order copays for formulary drugs increase from $16 to $20 and for non-formulary drugs from $46 to $49, resulting in an estimated $1.5 billion reduction in direct spending over 10 years. The military health system underwent a 90-day review resulting in an action plan ordered by then-Secretary of Defense Hagel. Some Members of Congress are interested in the plan's implementation. Sections 711 and 731 to 735 of the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics through public access and reports to Congress, requiring an estimated $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) is less demanding and costly compared to the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) which aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service highlighted concerns about access to contraception in the military. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed. The 2014 annual report of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service highlighted concerns about access to contraception in the military. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, including contraceptive diaphragms, intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. However, TRICARE does not cover condoms and nonprescription spermicidal products. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service highlighted concerns about access to contraception in the military. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, including contraceptive diaphragms, intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. However, TRICARE does not cover condoms and nonprescription spermicidal products. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception and counseling for DOD health care providers, ensuring all women in the Armed Forces have access to comprehensive counseling on contraception methods."
