Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite television services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through a service called Voom. SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via satellite dishes. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in the same market area, in addition to distant network signals. Understanding the distinction between local and distant network signals is crucial for SHVIA compliance. The SHVIA law allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local and distant network signals. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals come from elsewhere in the country. Consumers living outside the Grade B contour can receive distant network signals via satellite. The SHVA law established criteria for receiving distant network signals via satellite, based on the Grade B contour. Consumers inside the contour were not eligible, while those outside could receive the signals. Court challenges arose when some satellite companies transmitted signals to ineligible consumers, leading to over 2 million terminations. EchoStar appealed a 1998 Miami court decision to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. Congress \"grandfathered\" consumers who had been receiving signals illegally. In 1998, a Miami judge's decision led to over 2 million consumers having their distant network signals terminated by satellite companies. EchoStar appealed to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. The SHVIA law \"grandfathered\" consumers who had been receiving signals illegally. New subscribers must meet Grade B intensity criteria to receive distant network signals. The FCC confirmed the use of Grade B standard for SHVIA purposes. The FCC uses the Grade B intensity standard established by SHVIA for predicting signal strength. Consumers can seek a waiver from their satellite company to receive distant network signals if they believe they are not getting Grade A or Grade B signals. The local network affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. The satellite company forwards waiver requests to the local network affiliate, who has 30 days to decide. If the waiver is granted or no action is taken, consumers may receive distant network signals. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test at no cost to them. Costs for the test are covered by the \"loser\" of the test, or by other agreed-upon methods. Exceptions are made for recreational vehicles. Consumers may receive distant network signals at no cost if they do not receive a Grade B signal locally, have an RV or commercial truck with a satellite dish, or were previously receiving signals illegally. Exceptions are made for recreational vehicles. Following consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004, if they do not receive a Grade B signal locally, have an RV or commercial truck with a satellite dish, or were previously receiving signals illegally. \"Local-into-local\" service is permitted for DBS companies to transmit local broadcast TV signals to consumers in the designated market area. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) allows dishes to receive distant network signals indefinitely if they were receiving them before October 31, 1999. DBS companies may provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas, but are not required to do so. The law also includes a \"must carry\" provision, where DBS companies must carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they choose to provide any local station in that market. DBS companies must provide all local broadcast stations in a market if they offer any local station in that market. This requirement, known as the \"must carry\" provision, went into effect on January 1, 2002. Despite opposition from DBS companies, they are obligated to carry all local TV stations in a market that wish to be carried, with exceptions for duplicative programming and educational stations. Cable companies were already subject to similar rules based on the size of their systems. As of October 2004, EchoStar offered local-into-local service in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets. The \"must carry\" provision for DBS companies went into effect on January 1, 2002, despite opposition from the companies. EchoStar offered local-into-local service in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets as of October 2004. Both companies plan to expand to more markets as capacity allows, with EchoStar reporting that 83% of the population could receive its service when it reached 100 designated market areas. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services to reach more markets, with EchoStar reporting that 83% of the population could receive its service when it reached 100 designated market areas. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure that small and rural areas without access to local-into-local service from these providers can still receive local television through other satellite or terrestrial technologies. Satellite carriers were given compulsory copyright licenses for retransmitting distant network programming under the 1988 and 1999 laws. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers retransmitting distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering whether to further extend it and change how prices are set. Satellite companies were also given a compulsory license for retransmitting local signals. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers retransmitting distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering whether to further extend it and change how prices are set. Satellite companies were also given a compulsory license for retransmitting local signals, separate from business arrangements for retransmission consent. Table 1 summarizes the SHVIA provisions allowing satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service, implementing must-carry requirements for satellites, and applying syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication rules for satellite transmission of nationally distributed superstations. It also allows subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision to have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. The 1998 Miami court rulings allowed subscribers affected by the decision to retain distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The Grade B signal intensity standard is still used to determine who can receive distant network signals. Consumers can request waivers from local affiliates if signal strength is in doubt, at no cost. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The existing satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals is extended until December 31, 2004. The 1998 Miami court rulings allowed subscribers to retain distant network signals until December 31, 2004. Consumers can seek waivers from local affiliates for signal strength doubts at no cost. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The existing satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals is extended until December 31, 2004. The new legislation reduces copyright royalty payments for satellite companies by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. Cable subscribers no longer have to wait 90 days for access. Satellite companies can offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002, after which local PBS stations must be carried in markets with local-into-local service.

In 1999, H.R. 1554 proposed a loan guarantee program for small and rural markets, but it was removed due to objections by Senator Gramm. Congress later passed the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed by Congress as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. It created a board to select recipients of loan guarantees for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for consumers to receive local television signals nationwide, prioritizing \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas. The LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program, established by Congress, aims to provide loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion for projects that ensure nationwide access to local television signals. The program prioritizes serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. The Board issued regulations for the program in December 2003, with an application period ending in April 2004. Only one incomplete application was received, prompting the Board to return it and unanimously vote to reopen applications. The Board's website is http://www.usda.gov/rus/localtvboard/. Regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program were issued in December 2003, with an application period ending in April 2004. Only one incomplete application was received, prompting the Board to vote to return it and open another application period. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. The FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act allocated $280 million for the program, with an additional $80 million from the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act. The program progress was criticized by GAO in annual reports, emphasizing the need for accurate reporting of administrative costs. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required FCC to conduct tests on terrestrial systems for interference with DBS satellites. The \"Northpoint Provision\" mandated FCC to test terrestrial systems for interference with DBS satellites. Northpoint Technology's subsidiary, Broadwave, seeks to offer TV programming and data services through a terrestrial wireless system called MVDDS. MITRE Corporation conducted interference tests in 2001, concluding that co-existence is possible with mitigating techniques. The FCC allowed MVDDS and DBS systems to co-exist in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band after interference tests conducted by the MITRE Corporation. Northpoint objected to the decision to auction frequencies instead of granting licenses, leading them to not participate in the auction. Other companies participated, raising $118.7 million in the auction completed on January 27, 2004. The FCC allowed MVDDS and DBS systems to co-exist in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band after interference tests. Northpoint objected to the auction decision and did not participate, while other companies raised $118.7 million in the completed auction on January 27, 2004. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band."
