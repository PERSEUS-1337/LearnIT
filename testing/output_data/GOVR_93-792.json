        "Section 202 of the Social Security Act states that benefits are paid through the month before the month in which a beneficiary dies, with no benefits paid for the month of death. This rule, in place since 1939, does not apply to Medicare, which provides benefits up to the date of death. Social Security benefits are issued monthly on a retrospective payment system. If a beneficiary dies late in the month, family members may not notify the SSA in time to stop the payment, resulting in the need to return the check to the government. Members of Congress are frequently asked to support legislation for a full or partial benefit payment for the month of death.",
        "Critics argue that withholding Social Security benefits for the month of death is unfair as bills and funeral expenses still need to be paid. They highlight the inconsistency of receiving no benefit if one dies on the last day of the month, compared to receiving a full benefit if one dies shortly after.",
        "Critics argue that the current Social Security policy is unfair as it withholds benefits for the month of death, impacting individuals already struggling with funeral expenses. The policy's inconsistency is highlighted by the contrast between receiving no benefit for dying on the last day of the month and receiving a full benefit for dying shortly after. Critics question the logic behind returning benefits to the government and express frustration over the disadvantage faced by families when a beneficiary dies at the end of the month after incurring living expenses.",
        "Critics argue that the Social Security policy withholds benefits for the month of death, creating disadvantages for families. They question the logic behind returning benefits to the government and criticize the system for being arbitrary and unbending. Supporters of the policy argue that paying benefits for the month of death would be costly, estimated at $1.6 billion annually.",
        "The current Social Security policy withholds benefits for the month of death to avoid high costs, estimated at $1.6 billion annually. Alternative proposals include paying 50% of the benefit if the beneficiary dies in the first half of the month and a full benefit if they die in the second half, costing $1.2 billion annually. Pro-rating benefits based on the days the beneficiary was alive in the final month would cost $800 million annually. Another proposal suggests paying a full benefit to a surviving spouse or pro-rated benefit if no spouse survives.",
        "The Social Security policy currently withholds benefits for the month of death to avoid high costs. Alternative proposals suggest paying 50% of the benefit if the beneficiary dies in the first half of the month and a full benefit if they die in the second half, or pro-rating benefits based on the days the beneficiary was alive in the final month. The proposal estimated to increase benefit payments by $13.2 billion over 10 years. Survivor benefits are payable to eligible family members beginning with the deceased beneficiary's month of death.",
        "The Social Security system currently does not pay benefits for the month of death, with survivor benefits starting from the deceased beneficiary's month of death. A lump-sum death payment of $255 can be received by eligible family members. There are challenges in determining the rightful recipient of the benefit for the month of death due to the high number of beneficiaries passing away each year.",
        "To determine the proper recipient of the lump-sum death payment of $255 for Social Security beneficiaries who pass away, a labor-intensive process is required. Each case must be investigated thoroughly, especially if there are multiple family members, as the payment may need to be split among them. Careful attention is necessary to ensure the rightful payee(s) are identified in each case."
