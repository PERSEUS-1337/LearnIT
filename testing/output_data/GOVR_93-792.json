    "title": "Social Security Benefits Are Not Paid for the Month of Death",
    "content": "Social Security Act Section 202: Benefits paid until month before beneficiary's death. No benefits for month of death. Medicare pays benefits until date of death. Social Security benefits paid monthly via retrospective system. If beneficiary dies late in month, SSA may not be notified in time to stop payment, requiring return of check. Proposed legislation for full or partial benefit payment for month of death. The SSA may not be informed in time to halt benefit payments, resulting in checks needing to be returned. Proposed legislation aims to offer benefits for the month of death. Critics argue that withholding benefits for the month of death is unfair as bills and funeral expenses still need to be paid, especially in cases where someone dies at the end of the month. Critics view the current funeral and burial expense policy as unfair and cruel, putting grieving individuals at a disadvantage. They question why beneficiaries must wait a month for benefits and return money to the government in some cases, deeming the policy incomprehensible and unjust. Critics question why family members are disadvantaged when a beneficiary dies after incurring living expenses. They argue that not paying benefits for the month of death discredits the Social Security system. Supporters claim that paying benefits for the month of death would be costly, estimated at $1.6 billion annually by the SSA. Current policy does not pay benefits for the month of death to save costs. SSA estimates full benefits for that month would cost $1.6 billion annually. Paying 50% for the first half and full benefit for the second half would cost $1.2 billion. Pro-rating benefits based on days alive in final month would cost $800 million. Proposals also considered full benefits for surviving spouses or pro-rated benefits if no surviving spouse. The proposal aims to increase benefit payments by $13.2 billion over 10 years (2004-2013). Benefits are currently paid from the first month of entitlement, with survivors receiving benefits from the month of death of the beneficiary. - No benefits paid for month of death\n- Survivor benefits start from month of death\n- $255 lump-sum death payment for eligible family members\n- Challenges in determining deceased beneficiary's benefit recipients due to high number of annual deaths Over 2 million beneficiaries die annually, leading to a labor-intensive process to identify payment recipients. Investigations are required for each case, with possible payment splitting for multiple family members. Proper payees must be carefully selected."
