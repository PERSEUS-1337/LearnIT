    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are important for youth development, academic achievement, and social skills. Nonprofit organizations strive to prioritize the well-being of young athletes despite the inherent risks of injuries. Participation in school sports and amateur competitions leads to lower obesity levels and promotes better health in adulthood. Rules in amateur sports are essential for maintaining the greater good served by these activities. Rules makers in amateur sports face increasing lawsuits alleging negligence in rule-making decisions. Defending these claims repeatedly can hinder their ability to provide services and discourage talented individuals from participating in rule-making. Injuries are inherent in sports, and athletes accept these risks when choosing to compete. Lawsuits based on rule development are deemed unfair as rules must be clear and unambiguous to ensure fair competition. The threat of lawsuits in amateur sports can hinder rule-makers from providing services and deter talented individuals from participating in rule-making committees. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, definitions include economic loss (pecuniary loss from harm), harm (physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses), noneconomic loss (loss from pain, suffering, etc.), and nonprofit organization. The curr_chunk defines nonprofit organizations as those exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or organized for public benefit. It also defines nonprofit athletic organizations as those adopting rules for athletic competitions. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability Protection for Nonprofit Athletic Organizations: A nonprofit athletic organization is not liable for harm caused by its actions in adopting rules for athletic competitions or practices if it was acting within its duties, properly licensed, and the harm was not due to willful misconduct or gross negligence. Nonprofit athletic organizations are protected from liability for civil actions brought by employees, agents, or volunteers. State laws imposing risk management procedures or holding organizations liable for employee actions are exceptions to this protection. The limitation on liability does not apply to actions involving willful misconduct or gross negligence. The liability exemption does not cover actions related to antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or discrimination protection under Federal, State, or local laws. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION. This Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations after the effective date."
