Options include capturing and storing CO2, switching to low-carbon sources like wind or nuclear power, or increasing the use of natural gas, which emits less CO2 than coal. The abundance of natural gas reserves has sparked interest in using it as a lower carbon energy option. This was discussed in a 2009 Senate hearing on the role of natural gas in mitigating climate change. The Role of Natural Gas in Mitigating Climate Change was discussed in a hearing where executives emphasized the immediate carbon reductions possible through increased use of natural gas-fired power plants. They highlighted the reliability and potential for further emissions reductions with the right incentives. The report discusses displacing coal-fired generation with electricity from existing natural gas plants to achieve immediate carbon reductions. It provides an overview of the issues involved and highlights key considerations for Congress. The report includes background on gas-fired generation, feasibility issues, policy considerations, and information on gas-burning combined cycle generating technology. The report focuses on displacing coal generation with natural gas, considering factors like cost, engineering analysis of existing coal plants, and the potential use of underutilized combined cycle generating plants. It also discusses the feasibility of burning natural gas in existing coal plants and how circumstances may change over time. The report discusses the potential for displacing coal with natural gas, focusing on underutilized gas-burning power plants as an option. It highlights the growth of gas-fired power plants in the US from the 1990s to the present, emphasizing the efficiency and advanced technology of natural gas combined cycle plants. The report suggests that further analysis and modeling would be needed to address issues with older, inefficient plants not designed for baseload operation. The growth in nuclear capacity was limited, with new coal capacity being constructed. Wind capacity challenged natural gas as a source of new generating capacity in the late 2000s. Natural gas now dominates national generating fleet, but coal remains the primary source of electricity generation. The shift to natural gas was driven by concerns over cost, environment, and safety issues with nuclear and coal power. Oil-fired generation was not considered due to high costs and supply risks. Natural gas emerged as the primary energy source for new power plants due to cost, environmental benefits, and technological advancements. Gas-fired plants utilized combustion turbines, with the most significant development being the application of these turbines in modern natural gas combined cycle power plants, which are highly efficient and intended to operate as baseload generators. Gas-fired plants, particularly natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants, are favored for new power plant construction due to their cost-effectiveness and efficiency. NGCC plants can be built quickly and cheaply, costing about $1,200 per kilowatt of capacity and taking only two to three years to complete. This is in contrast to coal plants, which are more expensive and time-consuming to build. NGCC technology allows for modular construction, making it suitable for smaller scale projects, while coal plants are generally only economical at larger unit sizes. The attractiveness of NGCC technology was further enhanced by low natural gas prices in the 1990s, leading to its widespread adoption by independent power producers. Gas-fired plants, including natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants, became popular for new power plant construction in the 1990s due to low natural gas prices. NGCC technology produces fewer harmful environmental impacts than coal-fired plants and is easier to site and permit. The efficiency of NGCC plants results in lower carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity produced compared to coal plants. This shift towards gas-fired plants was also influenced by the restructuring of the electric power industry in the late 1970s and 1990s. The restructuring of the electric power industry in the late 1970s and 1990s led to the rise of independent power producers (IPPs) who built NGCC plants to meet baseload demand. Between 1990 and 2007, over 168,000 MW of NGCC capacity was constructed, along with additional less efficient peaking turbines and other generating technologies. This massive building program added 23% to the national generating fleet in 1990. Between 1990 and 2007, there was a 43% growth in generating capacity due to the construction of NGCC plants by independent developers. However, the building boom led to excess capacity and underutilization, exacerbated by a spike in gas prices after 2000. This resulted in a large amount of unused generating capacity in NGCC plants, with only 13% operating at a capacity factor of 70% or greater in 2007. The study group of NGCC plants in 2007 had an average capacity factor of 42%, while coal plants had an average capacity factor of 75%. The mismatch between the two types of plants creates an opportunity to displace coal power with gas generation. If the utilization of NGCC plants could be doubled to 85%, it could generate additional power equivalent to 32% of all coal-fired generation in 2007 and displace about 19% of CO2 emissions associated with coal-fired electricity generation. The feasibility of displacing coal with gas from existing power plants is discussed in this section. Issues such as transmission system factors, system dispatch factors, natural gas supply and price, and natural gas transportation and storage are considered. While NGCC units located at the same site as coal units can potentially displace coal-fired generation, in most cases they are built at separate locations with different transmission paths. This means there is no guarantee that NGCC plants can send power to the same loads as coal plants to displace coal-fired generation. The maps in Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the location of large coal and NGCC plants in the conterminous states. Some regions have both coal and NGCC plants, while others have only one type. Transmission system constraints can prevent one power plant from meeting the load served by another, including isolation of interconnections, limited transmission capacity, and congestion. The analysis considers the potential displacement of coal by gas using the proximity of coal and NGCC plants as a proxy for transmission interchangeability within the three interconnections of the electric power grid. The three interconnections in the electric power grid cover most of Texas and operate independently with limited links between them. Surplus capacity in one interconnection cannot be used to meet load in another due to electrical isolation. Each interconnection's network of power lines, generating plants, and consumers are linked together, functioning like a single giant machine where disturbances in one region can be detected in another. The power grid interconnections are not designed for long-distance power transfer. Initially built by single utilities to supply nearby areas, the grid evolved as local grids interconnected. However, the focus was not on constructing long-distance inter-regional lines, limiting the capacity to move power over long distances within interconnections. The transmission lines lack capacity for long-distance power transfer, leading to inefficiencies and uneconomic losses. Debate surrounds building new high-voltage lines to transport renewable energy from remote areas to cities, displacing fossil fuels. Upgrading or building new power lines is necessary to shift from coal to gas-fired generators. Transmission congestion can restrict power movement even over short distances. Transmission congestion occurs when power line use is limited to prevent overloading, leading to failure. It can occur regionally, at the state level, and locally in \"load pockets.\" Congestion increases costs and restricts power flows, impacting the efficiency of the power system. The impact of system congestion is not the cost but the restrictions on power flows. Congestion can limit the ability to transfer power from one plant to another, affecting the choice of power plants available. Selective additions to transmission capacity could lead to significant economic benefits for consumers. Transmission system limitations on coal displacement can be analyzed using computer models. The proximity analysis conducted by CRS looked at the distance between coal plants and NGCC plants to determine potential transmission line connections. This analysis aimed to see if NGCC plants could replace coal plants in serving the same load based on their proximity. The study groups were defined using 2007 data, with the latitude and longitude of each plant entered into a GIS to identify coal plants within a ten-mile radius of NGCC plants. The analysis calculated hypothetical surplus generation for NGCC plants within a ten-mile radius, aiming to displace coal plant generation. A second version included NGCC plants within 25 miles. The analysis is a first estimate of coal displacement potential based on proximity, with other factors like utility dispatch, transmission system, fuel cost, and reliability also influencing displacement potential. The proximity analysis results show that existing NGCC plants near coal plants could potentially displace 15% to 28% of coal generation and CO2 emissions. However, this would only account for a fraction of total U.S. coal generation and emissions. The analysis suggests that existing NGCC plants may only be able to displace around 30% or less of coal-fired generation and emissions, with greater displacement depending on more distant NGCC plants. The configuration and capacity of the transmission system will play a crucial role in determining the actual potential for displacing coal with power from existing NGCC plants. System dispatch involves managing power plants to meet changing load patterns. The utilization of coal and gas-fired plants follows similar seasonal patterns, with both operating at their highest levels during peak demand periods. This makes displacing coal with power from existing NGCC plants challenging, as surplus gas-fired generation is lowest when coal plants are operating at their highest capacity. The complexities of displacing coal with gas are evident in the detailed analysis of hourly dispatch at Plant Barry in Alabama. Despite low utilization of NGCC units in November 2007, there were still periods of high output, making it challenging to displace coal with natural gas. Realistic estimation of changing plant dispatch requires a thorough analysis, as large-scale displacement of coal-fired generation by existing NGCC plants could significantly increase U.S. gas consumption. The potential displacement of coal-fired generation by existing NGCC plants could lead to a significant increase in U.S. gas demand. In 2007, U.S. natural gas demand was already high, and replacing coal with NGCC plants could further increase demand by 5% to 20%. This additional demand could be met through increased domestic production, pipeline imports from Canada, Alaskan supplies, and imports of liquefied natural gas. The interest in coal displacement by gas is driven by the recent increase in natural gas availability from shale formations and other unconventional sources. The combination of higher gas production and reduced demand during the 2008-2009 recession has led to a sharp decline in gas prices. Optimism surrounds the long-term gas supply and price outlook, with estimates of over 2 quadrillion cubic feet of gas resources. Improvements in extracting gas from shale have significantly increased production, leading to a more stable production cycle. The EIA's long-term forecasts for natural gas prices in 2020 and 2030 have decreased due to increased shale gas production. Despite optimism, natural gas markets are historically difficult to forecast accurately. Gas prices have fluctuated unpredictably in the past, leading to challenges in supply and demand projections. Chemical Company: Increased shale gas supply has impacted production, similar scenarios have occurred in the past. Price fluctuations lead to drilling declines, followed by increased demand and prices. Demand destruction may occur to rebalance supply and demand. Potential increase in gas demand from coal displacement policy should not be underestimated. The increased gas demand, as shown in Table 6, could accelerate growth compared to current estimates. Gas-fired power plants receive fuel through a vast national pipeline network with storage facilities to meet peak demands. The increased demand for natural gas from existing NGCC plants for coal displacement may not be a constraint on pipeline capacity at a national level. However, there could be concerns about specific pipelines and storage facilities handling the potential increase in gas demand, which could range from 16% to 66%. Despite this, the natural gas industry has been effective at adding capacity to the pipeline system. The natural gas industry has successfully added significant capacity to the pipeline system, with plans for further additions in the coming years. The potential for displacing coal consumption in the power sector with NGCC plants depends on various factors such as excess generating capacity, operating patterns, transmission grid capabilities, and gas supply. The potential for displacing coal consumption in the power sector with NGCC plants depends on factors such as excess generating capacity, operating patterns, transmission grid capabilities, gas supply, and environmental impacts. Future conditions must be considered, as well as the uncertain cost implications of a coal displacement by gas policy. This could impact natural gas prices and other sectors of the economy. Congress may consider chartering a study to assess the potential for replacing coal with power from existing gas-fired plants. The study would analyze the operation of the power system, excess gas-fired capacity, infrastructure requirements, and potential cost impacts. Various scenarios, including future gas prices, would be considered to determine the feasibility of transitioning to gas-fired generation. Additionally, Congress could explore the option of using gas directly in existing coal-fired plants. The analysis explores the potential of using gas in existing coal-fired plants, either as a supplemental or primary fuel. This could displace coal while utilizing existing transmission lines, offering a significant advantage. The appendix provides background on the electric power system, including power plants, transmission lines, and distribution systems. Generating plants produce electricity from various sources, while transmission lines carry electricity to demand centers. The higher the voltage of a transmission line, the more power it can carry with fewer line losses during transmission. Policy discussions focus on high voltage networks for long-distance power movement. Capacity is the potential output of a generating unit, while energy is the actual electricity generated or released by a storage device. Capacity factor measures how intensively a power plant is utilized. The capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of actual electricity produced to the maximum possible output. It is important for understanding how intensively a power plant is utilized. The demand for electricity varies throughout the day, with baseload units meeting the minimum demand. Baseload units can meet some demand above the base by ramping generation up and down. Intermediate units quickly change output to match demand fluctuations. Peaking units, the most expensive, start up and shut down quickly to meet peak demand. They also serve as spinning reserve and quick start units. Units are dispatched in order of lowest variable cost. The economic dispatch of a power system's plants is based on lowest variable cost, with efficiency measured by a plant's heat rate. Lower heat rates lead to greater efficiency and lower costs. Heat rates are not applicable to plants that do not use combustible fuels. Plants with lower heat rates have higher priority in economic dispatch. The economic dispatch of power plants prioritizes those with low variable costs and high efficiency, based on heat rates. Baseload generators run continuously, combined cycle units meet intermediate load, and peaking plants operate as needed for high demand. Variable renewable plants like wind and solar are used to displace generation from gas-fired plants with higher costs. Variable renewable generation can be made firm by linking wind and solar plants to electricity storage, but current technology limits storage options. Combined cycle technology achieves high efficiency by capturing waste heat to generate electricity. Combined cycles are used to support industrial processes or provide space heating, increasing energy efficiency. Different configurations like 1x1, 2x1, or 3x1 designs are used based on capacity needs. Natural gas is the predominant fuel in the United States, but fuel oil or gasified coal can also be used. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants are being developed, with prototypes in operation and a commercial-scale unit under construction in Indiana."
