    "title": "AB 575",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8 in subject areas like language arts, mathematics, science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. The state board is mandated to adopt basic instructional materials for various subject areas, including science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. Procedures are in place for the submission of instructional materials, with restrictions on resubmission of materials that have been previously rejected without substantive changes. The state board adopts instructional materials for different subjects. Publishers must submit revisions within a specified timeframe or pay a fee for review. Materials are reviewed by committees, including teachers and content experts, within six months of submission. Additional time may be granted if needed. The state board adopts instructional materials for various subjects, including print, digital, and open-source materials. Criteria for adoption include alignment with state curriculum standards, compliance with state guidelines, factual accuracy, and alignment with content standards. Instructional materials should not include unnecessary exposure to commercial brand names, products, or logos unless deemed necessary for educational purposes or incidental to the illustration. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if fewer than five materials are submitted, with specific reasons required for rejection. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if the materials fail to meet the criteria or the state board's curriculum framework. This does not limit the board's authority to adopt non-basic instructional materials. The state board shall prescribe procedures for an open and flexible materials submission system to ensure diverse educational needs are met with instructional materials that represent cultural pluralism and a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based resources. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for publishers and schools. The materials remain on the list until a new curriculum framework is adopted. Lists are available by subject and grade level, including publisher information. The state board adopts regulations for exceptions and the Superintendent develops guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code defines followup adoptions and requires the department to notify publishers before conducting one. Publishers participating in followup adoptions are assessed a fee based on the number of programs submitted. The department charges a fee for followup adoptions to cover costs, aiming to keep the fee reasonable by minimizing duplication of work from the primary adoption process. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent and pay a fee for followup adoption submissions. The fee should not deter small publishers, and the state board may reduce it upon request. Small publishers and manufacturers, defined as those with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less, must pay fees for follow-up adoption submissions. Revenue from these fees is subject to budget review and can cover adoption and review costs. If there is little interest in a follow-up adoption, the state board may choose not to conduct it, with general fund revenue prohibited from covering the costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, and will be repealed on that date unless a later statute extends it before then."
