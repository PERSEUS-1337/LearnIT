A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, providing strong privacy guarantees while maintaining good utility. The method is extended to provide confidence intervals and test statistics, as well as estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function. Empirical evidence from clinical datasets supports the effectiveness of the proposed method. The survival function is crucial for modeling time to events in various domains, such as healthcare. Information leakage in healthcare is a serious issue, with personal healthcare data being highly sensitive. The Kaplan-Meier method is widely used for estimating the survival function in clinical research, highlighting its importance in reporting cohort survival statistics. The Kaplan-Meier method is commonly used in clinical studies and by statistical agencies worldwide to report survival statistics. Currently, there is no model that can provide formal privacy guarantees for estimating survival functions using this method. Existing approaches are limited in their applicability, and generative models like GANs may not generalize well to small, constrained datasets typically encountered in this context. We propose a differentially private method for estimating survival functions based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Our method guarantees private estimation of survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without extra privacy cost. It extends to competing risk cumulative incidence functions and has been validated on real clinical datasets. The method is available as an R package for easy adoption. The survival function is essential for modeling time to event data, accounting for censored observations. Various parametric methods and the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate the survival function. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a key tool in survival models for clinical literature. It defines the survival function based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time. The function changes only at failure times, resulting in a step function characteristic. Additionally, the concept of differential privacy ensures provable privacy in randomized algorithms. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is used in survival models for clinical literature. It defines the survival function based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time. Differential privacy ensures privacy in randomized algorithms, with smaller values providing stronger guarantees. The post-processing property of differential privacy states that an adversary cannot increase privacy loss by acting on the output of a differentially private algorithm. This property is crucial in our proposal for differentially private survival function estimation using the Kaplan-Meier method. Our approach ensures that the estimate of the survival function is differentially private, allowing for estimation of various accompanying statistics. Our approach ensures differential privacy in survival function estimation using the Kaplan-Meier method. A dataset is created with event and at-risk numbers at unique time points. A noise matrix is drawn from Laplace distribution based on the sensitivity of the dataset, and added to create a differentially private version. The method is presented as Algorithm 1. The simplicity of Algorithm 1 for ensuring differential privacy in survival function estimation is highlighted. The method requires minimal changes with no computational overhead compared to the original estimation. Formal privacy guarantees are provided, along with details on extending the method for differentially private estimation of other associated statistics. The global L1 sensitivity of the method is established in Lemma 1, with a sensitivity of two due to count variables for events and at-risk numbers at unique time points in matrix M. The text discusses the differential privacy of Algorithm 1 for survival function estimation. It mentions that adding or removing an individual can change counts by at most two. The method is proven to be differentially private by adding Laplace noise. The approach can easily be extended to include confidence intervals and test statistics for comparing survival function distributions. The text discusses the differential privacy of Algorithm 1 for survival function estimation, focusing on the calculation of differentially private confidence intervals for survival function estimates. The method is proven to be differentially private by adding Laplace noise, specifically for Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals. The text discusses the differential privacy of Algorithm 1 for survival function estimation, focusing on the calculation of differentially private confidence intervals for survival function estimates. The method is proven to be differentially private for hypothesis testing using the Logrank test. The text discusses using Algorithm 1 for differential privacy in survival function estimation, ensuring privacy for hypothesis testing with the Logrank test. By replacing sensitive data with differentially private counterparts, the test statistic Z can be made differentially private without affecting the overall privacy budget. This allows for outputting confidence intervals and test statistics without additional privacy costs, even in scenarios with multiple types of events. Competing events in clinical data require specialized estimates like competing risk cumulative incidence to avoid bias. Using Algorithm 1, differential privacy can be extended to competing risk scenarios, ensuring privacy for hypothesis testing. The cumulative incidence is -differentially private, allowing for confidence intervals and hazard function analysis. The differentially private extension of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is presented, along with an empirical evaluation on nine real-life clinical datasets. The dataset details are provided, and comparisons are made between the private and non-private versions of the survival function estimates. Our evaluation on nine real-life datasets shows that our privacy-preserving estimation of the survival function faithfully estimates the original function with little utility loss. The estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget, as shown in Figure 1. Our method provides good utility while protecting privacy, especially for moderate to medium-sized datasets. As dataset size decreases, utility of differentially private estimation worsens due to the need for larger noise. Median survival time estimates are precise even in high privacy regimes. Our method accurately estimates the median with high precision, even in high privacy settings. In cases of high survival rates, upper bounds on confidence intervals cannot be determined and are marked as \"NA\". Precision improves with larger dataset sizes, maintaining utility while ensuring individual-level privacy protection. Differentially private estimation performs comparably to non-noisy estimation, with test statistics following a \u03c72 distribution. Differentially private estimates do not alter statistical significance thresholds. The proposed method also provides accurate estimates for competing risk cumulative incidence. Our proposed method provides accurate estimation for survival analysis while protecting individual privacy. Various works have explored differentially private methods for regression modeling and generative models, but they are not suitable for survival function estimation. Our method is the first to offer differentially private estimation for survival functions. The first method for differentially private estimation of survival function and other statistics like confidence intervals, test statistics, and competing risk cumulative incidence was presented. Extensive empirical evaluation on nine real-life datasets showed a good privacy-utility trade-off. Datasets used for evaluation include cancer, Gehan, and kidney datasets with details on groups compared and time conversions. The dataset includes information on survival in various medical trials, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, acute myeloid leukemia, ovarian cancer, Stanford heart transplant, and lung cancer. Time is measured in months, and groups compared include males vs females, maintenance chemotherapy given or not, different treatment arms, age groups, and treatment regimens. The curr_chunk discusses the use of two datasets in a competing risk scenario for evaluating differential privacy in estimating cumulative incidence functions. The first dataset is from a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver, while the second dataset includes subjects on a liver transplant waiting list. The results show that the differentially private extension provides strong privacy guarantees. Theorem 6 states that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private. The curr_chunk discusses comparing probability density functions in a competing risk scenario for estimating cumulative incidence. It shows that the method provides strong privacy guarantees and is differentially private according to Theorem (Dwork & Roth, 2014)."
