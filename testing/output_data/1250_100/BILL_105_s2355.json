    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant issue, with many negative consequences such as increased likelihood of dropping out of school, higher rates of criminal behavior, and a correlation with high daytime burglary and vandalism rates. Additionally, a large percentage of violent juvenile crimes occur during school hours, and a majority of children arrested for crimes are truants. Some cities report high levels of unexcused student absences, reaching up to 4,000 per day. Truancy has significant social and economic costs, with high rates of inmates lacking high school education. Truants and dropouts cost the nation billions in lost earnings and crime control expenses. Effective prevention and intervention programs can improve school attendance and reduce crime rates, but there is a lack of targeted funding for these programs. Parents are often unaware of their child's truancy. SEC. 3. GRANTS. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"eligible partnership,\" \"local educational agency,\" \"qualified unit of local government,\" and \"unit of local government.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the eligibility criteria for partnerships seeking grants under this section. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, grants up to $100,000 to eligible partnerships to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. At least 25% of the grant must be used by local educational agencies. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 fiscal years to address truancy comprehensively. To comprehensively address truancy, measures include parental involvement, sanctions like community service and license suspension, parental accountability with fines and community service, in-school prevention programs, involvement of various community entities, technology use for communication, and eliminating incentives for truancy. Model programs prioritized for funding by the Attorney General to address truancy include initiatives from Fulton County, Georgia, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roswell, New Mexico, Rohnert Park, California, New Haven, Connecticut, Atlantic County, New Jersey, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Norfolk, Virginia. The Attorney General prioritizes model programs for funding to address truancy, including initiatives from various cities. Authorization of $25,000,000 for fiscal years 1999-2001 is provided for software and data collection programs."
