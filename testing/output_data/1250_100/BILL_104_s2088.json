The tax credit for employer-provided child care expenses under the \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" requires the child care facility to comply with state and local regulations, be open to all employees, not be their main business, and have at least 30% of enrollees be employees' dependents. The facility must not favor highly compensated employees, and if there is a recapture event, the taxpayer's tax will be increased based on the applicable recapture percentage and the decrease in credits from prior years.

The term 'recapture event' refers to the cessation of operation or change in ownership of a qualified child care facility, triggering recapture liability unless the new owner agrees to assume it in writing. The taxpayer in the facility is responsible for any recapture liability, computed as if there was no change in ownership. Special rules apply, such as the tax increase only for credits used to reduce tax liability, adjustments to carryforwards and carrybacks, and the increase in tax not being considered for determining credits under certain parts of the tax code. Additionally, the increase in tax does not apply in cases of casualty loss. The tax increase does not apply to a cessation of operation of a qualified child care facility due to a casualty loss if the loss is restored within a reasonable period. Special rules apply for aggregation, pass-thru in estates and trusts, and allocation in partnerships. No double benefit is allowed, with a reduction in basis if a credit is determined. If a credit is determined under this section for property, the basis of the property is reduced by the credit amount. If there is a recapture amount in a taxable year for property with reduced basis, the basis is increased by the recapture amount. No other deductions or credits are allowed for the credit determined under this section. The section provides details on the termination of the employer-provided child care credit after December 31, 1999. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include the employer-provided child care credit under section 45D. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
