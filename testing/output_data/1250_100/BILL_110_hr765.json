The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include new credits for flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicles and qualified alternative fuel motor vehicles. The new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle credit is determined under subsection (e) and the new qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle credit is determined under subsection (f). The credit amount for the new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle is based on the vehicle placed in service during the taxable year. The credit amount for flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicles and qualified alternative fuel motor vehicles is determined based on a table for the taxable year. The credit amount for vehicles with city fuel economy percentages ranging from 125% to over 225% compared to a comparable vehicle varies from $1,500 to $3,500. The city fuel economy of a new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle must be determined on an E-85 ethanol gallon equivalent basis, while the comparable vehicle's fuel economy is determined on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis. The term 'new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle' refers to a vehicle capable of operating on alternative fuel, gasoline, or any blend, certified to achieve a city fuel economy using E-85 ethanol of at least 125.
