    "content": "The \"Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2006\" establishes a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, including an initial plebiscite and subsequent procedures. It also addresses applicable laws, requirements, and the availability of funds for the self-determination process. The Congress acknowledges past presidential actions regarding Puerto Rico's political status, including the establishment of a task force to identify options for the territory's future status. President Bush required regular reports on progress in this regard. The Task Force appointed by President George W. Bush recommended a federally sanctioned plebiscite for Puerto Rico to choose between remaining a US territory or pursuing a permanent nonterritorial status. If the latter is chosen, a subsequent plebiscite would be held to select one of two nonterritorial status options, with Congress encouraged to begin a transition process once a majority choice is made. If Puerto Rico chooses to remain a US territory, periodic plebiscites should be held to keep Congress informed of the people's wishes. Federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, including initial plebiscite and subsequent procedures. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct a plebiscite in Puerto Rico to choose between continuing the existing territorial status or pursuing a path towards a permanent nonterritorial status. If the majority favors the existing status, additional plebiscites will be held every 8 years. If a majority vote favors permanent nonterritorial status in any plebiscite, the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct another plebiscite with options for statehood or becoming a sovereign nation. If a majority vote favors permanent nonterritorial status in a plebiscite, another plebiscite will be held with options for statehood or becoming a sovereign nation. The second plebiscite must be held during the 111th Congress, but no later than December 31, 2009, if the first plebiscite results in a majority vote for nonterritorial status. If a plebiscite under subsection (b) also favors nonterritorial status, the second plebiscite must be held within 2 years after the certification of the majority vote. SEC. 4. APPLICABLE LAWS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The Federal laws applicable to the election of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico also apply to any plebiscite under this Act. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over legal claims related to this Act. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will issue rules for the plebiscites. Eligible voters include those under Puerto Rico's electoral laws and U.S. citizens born in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will certify the results of each plebiscite to the President of the United States and Congress. A report will be submitted detailing measures to implement the chosen nonterritorial status option. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will certify the results of each plebiscite to the President of the United States and Congress, along with recommendations from the Task Force. During the period from October 1, 2006, until all required plebiscites are completed, the Secretary of the Treasury can allocate up to $5,000,000 from funds provided to Puerto Rico for plebiscite expenses, including voter education materials approved by the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status."
