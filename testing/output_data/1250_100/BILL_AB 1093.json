    "title": "AB 1093",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that California was ordered by the US Supreme Court to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by February 2016. Despite efforts like the 2011 Public Safety Realignment, the prison population exceeded the cap by 2,104 inmates in December 2014. Over 100,000 offenders were diverted to county supervision instead of state prisons. Proposition 47, passed in November 2014 in California, mandates misdemeanor sentencing for certain crimes and allows inmates to petition for resentencing. By December 2014, 132 inmates had been released due to resentencing. It is estimated that the prison population will decrease by 1,900 inmates in 2015-16 due to resentencing and reduced new admissions. Research shows that formerly incarcerated individuals have better outcomes when they receive training and job opportunities. Workforce training for reentering individuals helps them gain necessary skills and job placement assistance, reducing repeat offenses and lowering the number of people in prison. Investing in services for reentry populations aligns with California's workforce goals, as stated in the Strategic Workforce Development Plan. The State Workforce Investment Board administers the grant program according to Penal Code Section 1234.2. The State WIB administers a grant program for workforce training and education for reentering individuals. The program includes criteria for selecting recipients, outreach to small and rural counties, competitive grant awards, and addressing the education and training needs of individuals with postsecondary education or basic education for entry-level jobs. The grant program for workforce training and education for reentering individuals is competitively awarded through two rounds of funding. Each county can apply, and a partnership agreement with local workforce investment boards is required. Projects must include an education and training assessment for participants. Eligible uses of grant funds for workforce training include vocational training, stipends, and apprenticeship opportunities. Preference is given to applications with matching funds, involvement of nonprofit organizations, and specific criteria for success. The grant recipient must define the industry sector for training, methodology, and monitoring progress. They must report annually to the State WIB on fund usage and program outcomes. The State WIB will submit a report to the Legislature on the overall success of the grant program by January 1, 2018. The report will evaluate the grant program's effectiveness based on set goals and metrics, recommend the long-term viability of local and county collaborations on workforce training programs, and discuss the education and workforce readiness of participants, alignment with workforce needs, job market availability, and certification attainment for the supervised population. The program's effectiveness will be evaluated based on metrics like job readiness, long-term training enrollment, employment support networks, livable wage occupations, and alignment with program objectives. Reporting requirements will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and the act is deemed urgent for cost savings and operational efficiency."
