    "content": "The \"Kisatchie National Forest Land Conveyance Act\" authorizes the conveyance of certain Federal land in Louisiana for market value consideration. The Act defines terms like \"Collins Camp Properties\" and \"Secretary\" for clarity. The Secretary is authorized to convey Federal land in Louisiana by quitclaim deed, including a 2.16-acre parcel, to Collins Camp Properties. During a 1-year period, Collins Camp Properties has the first right of purchase by providing consideration to the Secretary. The Secretary is authorized to convey Federal land in Louisiana to Collins Camp Properties, including up to 47.92 acres of land in Winn Parish. The conveyance may be configured to maximize marketability or achieve management objectives, with consideration in the form of cash equal to the market value of the land. The market value of Federal land conveyed under this Act shall be determined by an appraisal conducted in accordance with standards and approved by the Secretary, or by competitive sale if conveyed by other methods. Hazardous substances disclosure requirements must be met, but the Secretary is not required to remediate or abate them, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act still applies to the conveyances of Federal land. The Secretary will deposit proceeds from the sale of Federal land into a specific fund. Administration of the process is outlined in the following section. Collins Camp Properties must pay appraisal and analysis costs for the conveyance of Federal land. They need written consent from holders of Forest Service special use authorizations to acquire the land. Failure to provide consent will result in Collins Camp Properties administering the authorization according to its terms. Collins Camp Properties must administer the special use authorization until it expires."
