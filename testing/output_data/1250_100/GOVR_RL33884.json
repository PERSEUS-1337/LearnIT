The Ninth Circuit found that \"true threats\" are not protected by the First Amendment, citing a case involving the posting of \"wanted\" bulletins targeting doctors. The United States Marshals Service, under the Department of Justice, is responsible for court security, executing warrants, protecting witnesses, and arresting fugitives. Marshals are appointed by the President and serve four-year terms. Section 105 calls for an additional $20 million in appropriations each fiscal year. The United States Marshals Service is seeking additional funding of $20 million annually to hire more marshals for court security. The President's budget for FY2008 also includes a request for $25.7 million for investigating threats against the Judiciary and enforcing the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.

The Attorney General is required to report to Congress on the security of federal prosecutors, including threats made against them, steps taken for their security, and policies governing their practices with state firearm licenses.

It also includes matching grants for armored vests for court officers and permits the Attorney General to require applicants to consider security needs after consulting with judicial and law enforcement authorities.

The Administrative Office of the United States Courts in the judicial branch has certain privileges. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts, like the Sentencing Commission, has authority. Judges can serve for life, retire at 65 with 15 years of service, or retire to senior status. Senior judges receive full salary and can be replaced for vacancy purposes. In 1999, court judges objected to an increase that would disincentivize serving on senior status. Legislation included provisions for paying for increases in Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance for judges aged 65 or over. Senior judges can be recalled for up to 90 days a year and assigned judicial duties within their circuit. Federal statutes outline the appointment authority for various positions in the judicial branch, with different judges having the power to appoint specific roles. Only judges in regular active service can hold certain powers, such as serving as a chief judge of a federal district or circuit. The decision to present an appeal to all judges of a particular circuit is made by a majority vote of judges in regular active service. Senior judges in a circuit can participate in en banc appeals if they were part of the original panel. They can also serve on various judicial bodies and have the same powers as active judges if they meet certain workload criteria. The amendment to 28 U.S.C. 296 grants powers to judges of a court, including appointment of court officers and magistrates, rulemaking, governance, and administrative matters. It specifically mentions the appointment of magistrate judges, potentially overriding circuit court en banc limitations. Magistrate judges are appointed by district court judges, and the amendment adds provisions for retired judges in active service to make appointments.

Federal courts can impose supervised release and fines on offenders, with prior laws requiring agreement to a payment schedule for fines before release.

Section 506 instructs the Attorney General to study the safety of federal judges regarding public access to state and local records.
