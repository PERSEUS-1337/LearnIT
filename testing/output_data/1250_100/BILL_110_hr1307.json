The Director may make advance or partial payments to claimants before the final settlement of a claim, to prevent recovery in excess of compensatory damages. This includes reducing the amount to be paid by the total of any previous payments or settlements made to the injured person. If a claimant receives a partial payment under this Act but further payment is denied, they can seek judicial review and keep the partial payment unless ineligible or fraudulent. A paid claim may include damages for loss resulting from unauthorized use of personal information.
