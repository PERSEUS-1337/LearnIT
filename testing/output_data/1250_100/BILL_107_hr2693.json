The Congress finds that the Holocaust was a tragic crime, with many Holocaust survivors facing challenges in claiming insurance policies. The ICHEIC was established in 1998 to address unpaid insurance claims. The ICHEIC, in collaboration with European insurance companies, regulators, Jewish organizations, and Israel, is working to resolve unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims. An Executive Agreement between the US and Germany supports the ICHEIC in resolving claims. Despite efforts, companies are still withholding names on dormant accounts, leading to a large number of idle claims applications. Insurance companies in the United States have a responsibility to disclose Holocaust-era insurance policies to facilitate quick resolution of questions and prevent further victimization. State legislatures have faced challenges in implementing laws to compel insurers to reveal names of policyholders. The purpose of this Act is to provide information on Holocaust-era insurance policies to victims and their heirs for prompt claims filing. The Holocaust Insurance Registry, established under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2001, collects and maintains records of information provided to the Archivist. This information is made publicly accessible and searchable online. Additionally, insurers are required to fully disclose Holocaust-era policies to facilitate claims filing for victims and their heirs. The Holocaust Insurance Registry, established under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2001, collects and maintains records of information provided to the Archivist. Insurers are required to disclose details of Holocaust-era policies to the Secretary of Commerce, including policyholder information and issuing entities. This information must be filed electronically within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Commerce then shares this information with the Archivist promptly. A penalty is imposed for non-compliance. The Secretary of Commerce will impose a civil penalty of at least $5,000 per day for insurers failing to comply with section 4. Amounts received as penalties can be used by the Archivist of the United States to maintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry. The Secretary of Commerce will notify State insurance commissioners of insurers failing to comply with section 4 or pay civil penalties. States can request information on non-compliant insurers operating within their jurisdiction. Additionally, there are provisions regarding State Holocaust claims reporting statutes. SEC. 9. State Holocaust Claims Reporting Statutes. This section clarifies that states can enforce laws requiring insurers to disclose information about insurance policies taken from victims of Nazi persecution. If a lawsuit against such a state law is dismissed because the insurance commissioner relies on this Act, each party should cover their legal fees. SEC. 10. Definitions. In this Act, the term \"commissioner of insurance\" refers to the highest-ranking officer of a State responsible for regulating insurance. The term \"covered policy\" includes life, dowry, education, or property insurance policies in effect between January 30, 1933, and December 31, 1945, issued to policyholders in areas occupied by Nazi Germany or its allies. An \"insurer\" is any person engaged in the insurance business in the US interstate or foreign commerce, and a \"related company\" is defined as a company associated with the insurer. The term \"related company\" refers to an affiliate as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act."
