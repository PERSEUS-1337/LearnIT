    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act\". It includes findings related to coastal and estuarine land protection. Congress finds that coastal and estuarine areas are vital habitats for commercial fish, shellfish, coastal birds, and natural plant communities. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 recognizes the importance of these areas and establishes a partnership for their protection. The National Estuarine Research Reserve system relies on designated areas for long-term protection and research critical to conservation efforts. Intense development pressures in coastal watersheds necessitate effective coastal management. Protection of undeveloped coastal lands through property acquisition is cost-effective and provides permanent protection from development. This is essential for maintaining and enhancing coastal and estuarine areas, benefiting the United States by preserving water quality, public beach access, wildlife habitat, and fisheries. Federal, State, and nongovernmental organizations have already made significant contributions to the long-term health of these systems through land acquisition projects. Enhanced protection can be achieved through watershed-based acquisition strategies. Conserving coastal and estuarine lands supports the economic and natural resource bases of communities in the coastal watershed, including well-managed forests with ecological, recreational, historical, and aesthetic attributes. This can be achieved through watershed-based acquisition strategies coordinated at various levels of government. Establishment of Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program to protect important coastal and estuarine areas threatened by development. The program is administered by the National Ocean Service through the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. Property acquisition grants are provided to coastal States with approved plans for acquiring land or interests in land. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program to acquire property for Coastal Zone Management Plans, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and watershed protection plans in coastal States. Grants are allocated through a competitive process involving consultation with relevant entities. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program requires nongovernmental and local governmental entities to identify priority conservation needs, values to be protected, and threats to those values. Participating States must evaluate how property acquisition may impact working waterfront needs. Awards are based on demonstrated need for protection and ability to leverage funds among various entities. The governor of the State or designated lead agency coordinates implementation. The governor or designated lead agency ensures that applications for the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Program align with the State's approved coastal zone plan. Priority is given to lands with significant ecological value that can be effectively managed. The Secretary consults with Federal agencies and non-governmental entities in developing guidelines. Eligible States and National Estuarine Research Reserves may allocate grants for land acquisition in cooperation with local governments, nongovernmental entities, and Federal agencies. The Secretary develops measures to ensure the proper acquisition of property or interests. The Secretary must ensure that property acquired through the program is from willing sellers. Performance measures will be developed to evaluate the program's effectiveness and must be reported to Congress every 3 years. Federal funds must be matched by non-Federal funds for grants, with a maximum of 75% of funding from Federal sources for any project. Waivers for this limitation may be granted by the Secretary. The program allows waivers for underserved communities or those with limited funding sources. Other federal funds can be used to cover project costs, subject to match requirements. Non-Federal cost share can include the value of land or conservation easements. The non-Federal cost share for a project grant can include the appraised value of land or conservation easements. Costs related to land acquisition, management planning, and restoration can also be used as a match if incurred within the grant period. No less than 15 percent of funds under the program will benefit National Estuarine Research Reserves. The Secretary can use up to 5 percent of funds for program planning and administration. Grant recipients must ensure acquired property is held in perpetuity and managed according to program purposes. The program requires that acquired property is not converted for other uses and if sold, funds must be returned to the Secretary. Definitions include terms like \"coastal State,\" \"conservation easement,\" and \"interest in property.\" The program requires that acquired property, including a conservation easement, is not converted for other uses. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2013."
