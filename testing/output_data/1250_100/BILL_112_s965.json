    "content": "The \"Family Act of 2011\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings as well. The \"Family Act of 2011\" is also known as the \"Family Act of 2011\". It highlights the recognition of infertility as a disease by the World Health Organization and the lack of comprehensive insurance coverage for infertility treatments in most states. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN INFERTILITY TREATMENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section providing a credit for infertility treatments. A credit of 50% of qualified infertility treatment expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year is allowed for eligible individuals, with a limit of $13,360. The credit is reduced for individuals with adjusted gross income exceeding $150,000. The credit for infertility treatment expenses is limited to $13,360 and is reduced for individuals with adjusted gross income over $150,000. No double benefits are allowed, meaning no credit if expenses are deducted elsewhere or reimbursed through other programs or insurance. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses is subject to limitations based on the taxpayer's regular tax liability and other credits available. Any excess credit can be carried forward to the following taxable year if it exceeds the limitation imposed by the tax code. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year if it exceeds the limitation imposed by the tax code, up to the 5th taxable year after the credit arose. Qualified infertility treatment expenses include amounts paid for in vitro fertilization. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses covers in vitro fertilization administered by licensed medical practitioners for diagnosed infertility. Expenses for fertility preservation procedures before medical treatments that may cause infertility are also considered qualified expenses. The tax credit for infertility treatment expenses does not cover procedures designed for sterilization or infertility. An eligible individual must be diagnosed with infertility by a licensed physician to qualify for the credit. Married taxpayers must file joint returns, and adjustments for inflation apply to dollar limitations. The dollar limitations for tax credits on infertility treatment expenses are subject to adjustments for inflation. The dollar amounts in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2)(A)(i) will be increased based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. If the increased amount is not a multiple of $10, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The taxable year begins with adjustments for inflation, rounding amounts to the nearest multiple of $10. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. Section 23A provides a credit for certain infertility treatments. Various sections of the Internal Revenue Code are amended to include references to section 23A. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
