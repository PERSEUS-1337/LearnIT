    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Bullying Redress and Verified Enforcement Act\" or the \"BRAVE Act.\" It amends Title IX of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include reporting requirements on bullying. The \"BRAVE Act\" amends Title IX to include reporting requirements on bullying, mandating local educational agencies to report bullying incidents within 7 business days. Employees must describe the bullying acts, any reference to protected characteristics, and the agency's response. The \"BRAVE Act\" requires local educational agencies to designate an individual to receive reports of bullying and inform employees of contact information. Within 60 days of receiving a report, the designated individual must inform all employees of the bullying acts and response, excluding student information. Additionally, quarterly reports on bullying incidents must be made publicly available. The \"BRAVE Act\" mandates that local educational agencies must publish quarterly reports summarizing reported bullying incidents and responses by employees, excluding any personally identifiable student information. Reports must also inform the public of the right to file a complaint. Personal student information should not be disclosed in these reports to protect privacy. The \"BRAVE Act\" requires local educational agencies to annually review bullying policies, certify compliance with the Act to receive federal funding, and submit quarterly reports. The Office of Civil Rights establishes a procedure for submitting complaints regarding bullying incidents. The Assistant Secretary establishes a procedure for submitting complaints regarding bullying incidents and investigates complaints to determine if a local educational agency failed to comply with the \"BRAVE Act.\" If non-compliance is found, actions may include withholding funds, issuing a cease and desist order, or entering into a compliance agreement. The Assistant Secretary can take actions to address non-compliance with the \"BRAVE Act,\" including entering into a compliance agreement with the local educational agency. Within 60 days of receiving a complaint, information about the complaint will be made public on the Department of Education's website, excluding any personally identifiable information. The term 'bullying' is defined as severe, pervasive, or persistent acts by students causing harm or concern for another student's well-being, leading them to withdraw from school activities. 'Protected characteristic' includes race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation."
