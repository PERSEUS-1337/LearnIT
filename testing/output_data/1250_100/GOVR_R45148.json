    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods produced less efficiently, leading to higher consumption levels. Imports in the United States serve various purposes, including meeting demand for goods not produced domestically and accessing cheaper or more efficient foreign products. Trade allows consumers to access a wider variety of goods at lower costs. Trade benefits consumers by providing access to a greater variety of goods at lower costs, improving purchasing power, and controlling inflation. It also allows producers to access lower-cost inputs, improve global competitiveness, and exploit economies of scale through exports. Trade leads to greater competition, encourages innovation and investment in research and development, supporting increased productivity and economic growth. The theory of comparative advantage, developed by economist David Ricardo in the 19th century, explains how countries benefit from specialization and trade. The theory of comparative advantage, developed by economist David Ricardo, explains how countries benefit from specialization and trade. Ricardo argued that a country should specialize in goods it can produce relatively well and trade for goods it produces less efficiently. This theory focuses on opportunity cost rather than absolute cost of production, and economists continue to study its relevance in today's global trade patterns. With the rise of global value chains and digital trade, differences in comparative advantage between countries arise due to factors of production like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Economic theory predicts that a country will have a comparative advantage in activities that make intensive use of its abundant factors of production. The ICT revolution and new platforms also play a role in affecting relative efficiency and comparative advantage. The ICT revolution and digital trade have reduced barriers to technology and knowledge-flows between countries, influencing comparative advantage. Governments can shape comparative advantage through policies that indirectly nurture it (e.g., eliminating corruption, enforcing property rights) or directly support specific industries (e.g., subsidies, tariffs). There is debate on the effectiveness of targeted policies in promoting strategic industries. Protectionist policies can distort trade and investment flows, reduce economic efficiency, and hinder the development of competitive industries. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies with similar resource endowments. Economies of scale play a role in trade patterns, leading to specialization in certain goods. Trade is a key driver of changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and the standard of living in the U.S. economy. Overall, trade has a positive impact on economic well-being by promoting resource efficiency, competition, economies of scale, and consumer welfare. Increased trade can boost GDP through enhanced competition and efficiency gains. Global trade liberalization has significantly reduced extreme poverty over the past 25 years. However, the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed, with some sectors experiencing disruptions and certain regions and industries facing job losses and stagnant wages. The economic impact of trade on jobs and wages is a topic of ongoing debate due to various factors influencing employment. The impact of trade on jobs and wages is a widely debated topic due to various factors such as technology changes. Economists argue that policies facilitating adjustment and compensating for losses are more economically efficient than protective measures. Trade can create and destroy jobs, affecting workers differently based on occupational exposure. Adjustment assistance for displaced workers is crucial for maintaining political support for free trade, but existing policies in the US are deemed inadequate. Trade liberalization can lead to job shifts within industries and sectors, with some workers facing displacement. Estimates show that job loss due to trade is a small percentage of overall job losses annually. While some workers may struggle to find new jobs with reduced wages, others may be reemployed elsewhere. Studies suggest that increased import competition from China negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Most economists argue that equating net imports with unemployment is questionable. U.S. global trade has historically expanded during economic growth, with the trade deficit and unemployment rate moving in tandem. International trade can impact worker wages positively and negatively, with no consensus on the overall effect on U.S. workers' wages and income inequality. Many studies have found that factors like technological change have had a larger impact on wages than trade. Increased imports from countries like China can negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. U.S. workers face competition from lower-cost producers in developing countries, leading some multinational corporations to shift production overseas. On the other hand, high-end services jobs in the U.S. often require high levels of education and skills. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor flows. U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more than those in non-exporting industries, with an average earnings premium of 16% in export-intensive manufacturing and 15.5% in services. Global trade as a percentage of GDP increased from 25% to 57% from 1960 to 2017, following the post-World War II period of economic globalization. Globalization has led to the growth of global foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased trade, facilitated by advancements in transport and communication. Policies have reduced barriers to international exchange since World War II. There is ongoing debate about the inclusivity and inequality effects of globalization. Global value chains (GVCs) organized by multinational corporations (MNCs) allow for production across multiple countries. Global value chains (GVCs) have become a key driver of globalization, with more than half of global manufacturing imports being intermediate goods traded within supply chains. The international fragmentation of production has increased trade associated with final products and blurred the distinction between advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries. GVCs have facilitated lower trade barriers, technological advances, and faster international transport, accelerating the flow of information across borders. The evolution of global value chains (GVCs) has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates has made imports essential for exports, with policies affecting imports also impacting exports. Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a significant role in driving trade, as multinational corporations (MNCs) source production globally within their chains. This has led to the majority of trade occurring within MNCs. Foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational corporations (MNCs) has significantly expanded inter- and intra-firm trade. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services in foreign markets, adapt to local preferences, and access raw materials or cheaper labor. In 2016, 11% of U.S. foreign affiliates' sales went to U.S. parent companies, 59% to the host country's market, and 30% to other foreign countries. Foreign firms invest in the United States to access the consumer market, skilled labor, and resources. Global integration through trade and investment can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. This may impact U.S. employment rates and income volatility, with manufacturing jobs shifting abroad but potentially boosting service-related jobs. Wealth distribution is also affected by globalization. Globalization impacts wealth distribution by dampening wages for lower-skilled U.S. workers due to foreign competition and increasing returns to capital. Studies show that globalization has marginally contributed to rising wage inequality in the U.S. at a factor of 10% to 20%. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) is a key principle in the World Trade Organization, requiring members to treat all countries equally in trade agreements. Most-favored nation (MFN) trade status ensures equal treatment among trading partners, prohibiting discrimination between domestic and foreign products, services, and intellectual property rights. Exceptions include trade agreements outside the WTO and special treatment for developing countries. Cuba and North Korea do not have permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with the U.S. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving such treatment at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further denies PNTR status for countries restricting freedom of emigration. WTO requires the US to extend MFN treatment to all members. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs on imported goods. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification based on standard commodity codes developed by the World Customs Organization. The HTS groups products into 96 chapters with increasing detail as the digits increase. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the HTS, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code. Border Protection enforces the tariff code and interprets rules of origin (ROO) to determine product nationality for imports. ROO are crucial for import admissibility, duty rates, and eligibility for trade programs. Determining origin can be complex due to global sourcing of parts. The U.S. negotiates ROO in FTAs to ensure tariff benefits for eligible partners and protect import-sensitive industries. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires materials from FTA partners. Some argue this rule is too strict. Global trade is crucial for the economy, with trade as a share of global GDP rising from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. Trade reforms have led to higher growth in productivity, real incomes, and reduced poverty worldwide. While trade growth outpaced GDP growth after World War II, recent years have seen a slowdown attributed to various factors including weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and trade protectionism. Trade growth has rebounded since then. Trade growth rebounded from 2% in 2016 to over 5% in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption. IMF and WTO projected a rebound for 2018 and 2019, but now expect a slowdown due to rising trade tensions. Restrictive trade policies by the US and its partners are affecting trade flows and prices. Top trading economies in 2017 were the US, China, Germany, Japan, and the UK. In 2017, the top trading economies were the US, China, Germany, Japan, and the UK. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. The US was the largest importer and second-largest exporter in goods trade, and the largest importer and exporter in services trade. The US share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. US exports and imports combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. The US ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, the United States was ranked first out of 140 economies in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. U.S. exports grew by over 40% in the past decade, reaching $2.4 trillion, while imports grew by over 20% to $2.9 trillion. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with exports as a percent of GDP expanding from 5% to 12% in 2017, and imports from 4% to 15%. China was the top U.S. trading partner, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without a free trade agreement. Multinational corporations (MNCs) engage in global value chains, making it challenging to interpret trade data accurately. For example, U.S. imports of products like iPhones attribute full value to the country of assembly, such as China, even though most of the value added comes from the U.S. where design, software development, and other high-wage functions occur. This highlights the complexity of trade implications for the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit with China is inflated due to the attribution of full value to China for imports from various countries. The concept of \"trade in value-added\" aims to identify the origin of value added in goods and services. According to TiVA estimates, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if measured this way. A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports, indicating a nation consumes more than it produces. The United States has consistently run trade deficits since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017. The deficit is mainly driven by goods trade, which was at $807.5 billion. However, the U.S. usually runs surpluses in services, with a surplus of $255.2 billion in 2017. The current account deficit, which includes trade in goods, services, and net income, has been ongoing since the mid-1970s, with a deficit of $449.1 billion in 2017. The U.S. global trade deficit is largely due to economic slowdown post-2008 crisis, reduced demand for imports, and decline in commodity prices. It reflects U.S. consuming more than producing and importing more than exporting. Trade deficit stems from imbalance between domestic savings and total investment. Low rate of domestic savings leads to borrowing from countries with excess savings, boosting economic growth, consumption, and demand for imports. Other factors affecting trade deficit include differences in economic growth between countries. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by factors like differences in economic growth between countries and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Foreign investors seek dollar-denominated assets as safe-haven assets, sustaining the deficit. As long as funds are loaned to the U.S. to finance the lack of savings, the deficit can continue. The U.S. current account deficit relative to GDP has declined since reaching a historic high in 2006. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by factors like differences in economic growth between countries and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Among selected countries, the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada had the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP, while the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had the largest current account surpluses. Policymakers view U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China as unfair due to market-distorting trade policies, but high tariffs and trade barriers do not necessarily reduce overall trade deficits. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by factors like differences in economic growth between countries and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Bilateral trade balances provide a snapshot of trade relationships but are influenced by various factors beyond trade barriers. Reducing protectionist trade measures may not necessarily decrease overall trade deficits, as increased demand for imports could offset any gains from increased exports. Trade diversion may occur, shifting trade from one country to another without significantly impacting the overall trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is affected by factors like economic growth disparities between countries and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency. Trade imbalances lead to adjustments in exchange rates, with net imports causing an excess of U.S. dollars flowing abroad. The dollar's status in global markets as a medium of exchange and reserve currency, along with foreign investments in U.S. Treasury securities, can impact trade deficits by affecting the dollar's value and making U.S. exports more expensive. Some analysts argue that foreign governments, like China, have intervened in currency markets to keep their currency undervalued, which hampers global trade balance realignment. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the United States borrowing from abroad. Concerns arise from the debt accumulation due to sustained trade deficits. Borrowing for productive investments can lead to higher economic growth, but borrowing for consumer purchases may result in deficits that are harder to pay off. Borrowing to finance consumer purchases can push repayment to future generations without investments to raise the ability to finance those repayments. Some economists warn that a rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil. Attempting to reduce the trade deficit without addressing macroeconomic imbalances could negatively affect the economy. The current account deficit could be reduced by boosting domestic savings or reducing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates through the depreciation of the dollar is also a potential solution. In 2017, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for 56% of exports and 70% of imports. Top exports and imports included transportation equipment, computer products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have shifted manufacturing activities, with advanced technology driving production while labor-intensive tasks move abroad. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a decline in employment but an increase in output due to increased productivity. While manufacturing remains a significant component of the economy, its share of GDP has decreased. Reports of factory closings and layoffs have reinforced the perception of a shrinking manufacturing sector. In 2017, U.S. manufacturing accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980. Despite a long-term decline in manufacturing employment, overall employment has increased since 2010. The shift towards services has been a global trend, with factors such as technology and consumer preferences playing a role. The impact of trade on manufacturing employment is a topic of debate, with some attributing job losses to increased imports from China. The U.S. manufacturing sector has undergone a fundamental restructuring over the past two decades, with job losses in manufacturing offset by job gains in services due to global exports. While trade has been debated as a factor, automation and other reasons are also considered. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the U.S. economy, accounting for a large portion of research and development and exports. Despite a decline in global manufacturing value-added, the U.S. remains a top global manufacturer. In 2017, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods, with agriculture accounting for 6% of total U.S. exports. Agriculture's share of U.S. exports has fallen slightly below the average of 8% over the past decade, while the import share remains on trend. Trade remains a significant component of the U.S. agricultural sector, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production by value. Foreign markets are a major outlet for many agricultural goods, with wheat and cotton relying on other countries for absorbing over half of U.S. output. Imports of certain products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices have accounted for a large share of U.S. food consumption in recent years. Services encompass a wide range of economic activities that not only function as end-use products but also facilitate the rest of the economy. Transportation, telecommunications, and financial services play crucial roles in global value chains and trade. Barriers to trade in services are often different from those for goods, with many restrictions occurring within the importing country. These barriers can include discriminatory regulations favoring domestic providers and limitations on establishing a commercial presence in foreign markets. In 2017, the United States faced challenges in expanding its trade in services due to these barriers. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with exports accounting for 34% of total exports. Services trade is vital to the U.S. economy, contributing to 79% of GDP and 82% of full-time employment. Surpluses in services trade have helped offset deficits in goods trade. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to the value chain's embedded services like R&D and business services. Digital trade, including services like online shopping, communication channels, and financial services, plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity and competitiveness. Trade barriers in digital trade can be tariff or nontariff, with nontariff barriers often taking the form of localization requirements. ICT services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods. Trade barriers in digital trade, such as localization requirements, restrict cross-border data flows essential for digitally delivered exports and services. These barriers can limit the type of services a firm can offer and hinder communication with subsidiaries or headquarters abroad. The United States has historically focused on reducing trade barriers through trade agreements to support economic growth and job creation. The U.S. trade policy aims to reduce barriers through agreements, enforce trade laws, and support economic development. Key objectives include national security, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the trading system. The U.S. government handles trade policy formulation, negotiation, enforcement, and trade programs. The U.S. trade policy is implemented through trade agreements, investment programs, and interagency coordination. The USTR and various U.S. agencies play key roles in trade policy, with Congress having legislative and oversight authority. Agency roles have evolved over time, with Congress designated as the primary authority over trade policy by the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. trade policy is based on statutory authorities granted by Congress, including the power to lay taxes, regulate commerce, and make necessary laws. Congress enacts tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and approves reciprocal trade agreements. Trade policy functions are governed by laws authorizing trade programs, tariffs, nontariff barriers, and import/export policies. Congress sets negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority and conducts oversight hearings on trade programs and agreements. Certain powers are delegated to the President for reciprocal negotiations. The President has delegated powers to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action on trade policy. Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, allowing the President to reduce tariffs within approved levels and implement new tariffs by proclamation. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded this authority to open markets and negotiate international trade norms. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have primary responsibility for trade matters, with other committees also involved based on jurisdiction. The House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking Committees have jurisdiction over export controls and trade relationships. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Separate CAGs exist for each house, chaired by relevant committee chairs. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting, committee membership, testimony, letters to USTR, and informal influence over other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA) is also a key aspect of trade policy. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" streamlines the approval and implementation of trade agreements by Congress. It ensures expedited consideration of implementing legislation through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments, as long as certain requirements are met. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and enhances the President's negotiating credibility with U.S. trading partners. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" ensures expedited consideration of trade agreements by Congress without amendments. The President is responsible for conducting foreign relations, negotiating treaties, and implementing trade agreements. The executive branch also handles customs enforcement, trade laws, budget proposals, and export/import policies. The President directs overall trade policy and has specific trade functions granted by statute. The chief adviser on trade policy to the President is involved in these processes. The USTR, a Cabinet-level appointment, is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to provide better balance in trade policy formulation and implementation. Trade functions are delegated to various departments and agencies within the executive branch, which coordinate U.S. positions through an interagency process. Key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, State, and the Treasury, as well as Homeland Security and Labor. The USTR is primarily responsible for trade negotiations and policy decisions, working with other Cabinet-level departments through a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by the USTR, with sub-Cabinet groups like the Trade Policy Review Group and Trade Policy Staff Committee. The President influences trade legislation and signs it into law. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation, signing it into law, and making specific decisions on U.S. trade policies. This includes requesting Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), initiating trade remedy cases, and communicating with foreign leaders. The private sector and stakeholders contribute to U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The U.S. trade policy is shaped by a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. This system includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, general policy advisory committees, and technical advisory committees. These committees ensure that public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs, providing information and advice on negotiating objectives and bargaining positions for trade agreements. Private sector representatives, NGOs, and labor groups also influence U.S. trade policy by testifying before congressional committees and government bodies, as well as providing feedback through Federal Register notices. The U.S. trade policy involves seeking input from stakeholders on various trade initiatives through Federal Register notices. Trade is crucial to the economy, covering a wide range of goods and services that can be traded internationally. Congressional decisions on trade agreements and cases like antidumping can impact employment, economic growth, and consumer choices. Stakeholders also aim to gain greater market access in different countries. The increasing focus on nontariff issues in trade agreements has broadened stakeholder interest, with various groups striving to ensure their views are represented. Legal challenges in federal court may involve customs decisions, antidumping proceedings, national security investigations, and enforcement of customs laws. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. Federal court cases involving trade laws are typically heard in the USCIT, which can significantly impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations, executive branch actions, and constitutional issues. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions and trade remedy determinations. The court consists of nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trade liberalizing agreements are negotiated by the United States for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons, aiming to reduce tariffs, increase market access for U.S. exporters, and gain competitive advantages for U.S. firms. The United States participates in various trade agreements to offer consumers more choices, promote liberalization of trade and investment, and strengthen alliances. These agreements include multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization, free trade agreements (FTAs) involving two or more countries, and plurilateral agreements focusing on specific sectors. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with the majority of partners being small, developing countries. Only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners, while over 99% is with WTO member countries. Under the Trump Administration, there has been a shift towards bilateral trade negotiations, including the withdrawal from the TPP and renegotiation of NAFTA into the USMCA. The USMCA, a renegotiated NAFTA agreement, was proposed on November 30, 2018, under TPA procedures for expedited consideration by Congress. Amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA were also negotiated, including the delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff. USTR notified Congress of intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the EU, and the UK in October 2018. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive with tariff coverage and enforceable commitments beyond WTO rules. The United States seeks to establish new trading rules in recent trade negotiations and agreements, including issues like digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) are nonbinding agreements between the U.S. and other countries to promote trade and investment, with over 50 TIFAs in place, mostly with developing countries. TIFAs do not require congressional approval and can lead to joint ministerial-level councils and working groups for consultations on economic interests. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 as part of the post-WWII effort to build a stable international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995. The GATT aimed to lower tariffs and promote nondiscriminatory trade practices. The WTO, with 164 member countries, administers trade rules to eliminate barriers and promote trade. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established on January 1, 1995, by its members, including the United States, to create nondiscriminatory trade rules. It oversees agreements like GATT, GATS, TRIPS, and conducts negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda. The WTO's effectiveness in trade negotiations and dispute resolution has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round. Members are exploring reforms to improve the organization's role in the global trading system, including potential changes to the dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body amid concerns over \"judicial overreach.\" The WTO Appellate Body, a 7-member panel, reviews appeals in dispute cases amid concerns over \"judicial overreach.\" Without new appointments, the dispute settlement system may cease by late 2019. Members can challenge trade practices violating WTO agreements through dispute settlement proceedings. Consultations precede panel adjudication, with the option to appeal to the WTO AB. Non-compliance may lead to retaliatory actions or compensation requests. The US has been heavily involved in WTO disputes, filing or responding to the most cases among members. The United States is heavily involved in WTO disputes, with pending challenges to recent tariff measures. WTO decisions do not directly affect U.S. law, and compliance actions are determined by USTR. The U.S. may amend regulations or practices in response to successful challenges, or pay compensation to complainant countries. Generally, the U.S. seeks to comply with WTO decisions to ensure other members do the same. U.S. FTAs establish procedures to resolve disputes through consultations or panel adjudication. State-state dispute settlement is not frequently used, with most disputes resolved via consultations or under WTO rules. Most U.S. disputes with FTA partners are adjudicated under WTO rules, with one FTA labor dispute brought to formal dispute settlement. FTAs also contain investor-state dispute settlement provisions. The USMCA maintains a binational panel system for reviewing trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from developing countries. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories. In 2017, $21 billion worth of imports entered the U.S. under the GSP program. In 2017, $21 billion imports entered the United States under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, out of $220 billion total imports from GSP countries. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including protections for intellectual property and worker rights. The USTR is currently reviewing the eligibility of several GSP beneficiary countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration in international trade. The U.S. government sees TCB as crucial for helping countries negotiate trade agreements and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. The United States lacks a single agency to coordinate trade capacity building (TCB) efforts, with USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) receiving the most funding for TCB activities. Various agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency, also have TCB responsibilities. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects tariffs at ports of entry, generating $32 billion in revenue in 2016. The U.S. has historically used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization and support economic prosperity. The United States has historically used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization and economic prosperity. By 2016, global tariffs had fallen to less than 7% on average, with U.S. tariffs at 3.3%. The Trump Administration has criticized low-tariff policies and increased tariffs on certain goods. U.S. trade laws include remedies to address unfair trade practices, such as antidumping measures. Trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws are used to address unfair trade practices. These laws are administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, patent and copyright infringements, and counterfeit goods. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations. Supporters argue that trade remedies are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers. Antidumping (AD) is a key U.S. trade remedy law aimed at addressing unfair trade practices, where foreign goods are sold at lower prices than in their home market. AD duties are imposed when imports cause material injury to a U.S. industry. AD orders are subject to annual review and sunset review every five years. As of mid-December 2018, the United States had 354 AD orders in place. The United States had 354 AD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with over one-third against China. Countervailing duty (CVD) is another frequently used trade remedy law to offset competitive advantages from foreign subsidies. The US had 113 CVD orders in place, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restrict imports causing serious harm to domestic industries through safeguard actions like tariffs or quotas. The International Trade Commission (ITC) conducts safeguard investigations to provide temporary relief to domestic industries facing serious injury from import competition. Unlike Anti-Dumping (AD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) cases, no unfair trade practices allegation is needed for a safeguard investigation. The ITC makes recommendations on temporary relief to the President, who decides whether to implement them. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration, resulting in safeguard measures on solar cells and large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures imposed by the President. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security conducts investigations, and the President can impose tariffs or quotas based on the findings. This provision has been invoked infrequently, with recent tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imports in 2018. The President imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in 2018 under Section 232. The Administration is investigating uranium, autos, and auto parts imports. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the US to enforce trade agreements and address unfair trade practices, including intellectual property rights violations. USTR can initiate cases and seek negotiated settlements with trading partners, resorting to retaliation if necessary. The USTR uses Section 301 to retaliate against countries with inadequate IPR regimes. They have initiated 125 cases since 1974, retaliating in 16 instances. In 2017, an investigation into China's IPR technology policies led to increased tariffs on imports. China responded with its own tariff increases. In response to China's tariff increases on $110 billion worth of U.S. products, the U.S. imposed an additional $267 billion in new tariffs. Both countries pursued dispute cases at the WTO. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate \"structural changes\" related to IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. The U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases contingent on an agreement. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits unfair competition in importing goods. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits imports infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more without proof of injury. The ITC conducts investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs provide federal aid to workers and firms affected by trade, last reauthorized in 2015. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is a federal program that provides aid to workers who have lost their jobs due to foreign competition. The program, administered by the Department of Labor, offers benefits such as career services, training, and income support. TAAW, the largest program under TAA, had appropriations of $790 million in FY2019. Additionally, smaller TAA programs exist for firms and farmers affected by foreign competition. Trade liberalization can benefit overall economic welfare but may cause adjustment problems for affected firms and workers. TAA is seen as a less disruptive option to offset the impacts of trade liberalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is justified for economic efficiency, equity, and generating support for international trade. Critics argue it is costly, reduces incentives for relocation, and may not be equitable. Despite disagreements, Congress has maintained the program for five decades. Several federal agencies support U.S. exports and investment, including the Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The Ex-Im Bank, Department of Agriculture, and OPIC administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act establishes a new agency for OPIC. U.S. trade financing aims to level the playing field against foreign firms with subsidized financing. The Ex-Im Bank provides loans and insurance to finance U.S. exports to counter similar activities by foreign governments. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) operates under a renewable statutory charter and has faced challenges in its operations due to unfilled board positions. Export controls are a controversial policy issue, balancing national security goals with export competitiveness. The United States restricts exports through various acts like the Arms Export Control Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, and certain nuclear materials to prevent proliferation of weapons. Export controls are administered by multiple departments and require licenses. The Export Control Act of 2018 grants broad authority to implement dual-use export controls, replacing the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. This law allows control of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" essential to national security. Dual-use goods are commodities, software, or technologies with civilian and military applications. Examples include nuclear materials, electronics, and lasers. Licenses for exports are issued by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security based on technical characteristics and end use. Foreign direct investment involves acquiring real assets, while foreign portfolio investment involves buying equities or bonds. FDI stimulates direct employment, while portfolio investments are highly liquid. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from $4 trillion in 1990 to $23 trillion in 2017. Capital flows also expanded, reaching about $4 trillion annually, with a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007. Other capital flows, such as foreign exchange and derivatives markets, experienced explosive growth during this period, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods. The total daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion in 2016, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods. Multinational corporations invest abroad to increase profits, driven by factors like competitive advantages and resources in host countries. FDI supports the development of global value chains and allows firms to operate efficiently. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in global business, allowing firms to operate close to customers in foreign markets and access resources like a skilled workforce. FDI transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, can enhance a firm's global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States leading as both the largest source and recipient of FDI. Developing Asia accounted for the largest share of global FDI inflows, followed by Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. The United States is the largest source and recipient of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with rapid growth in FDI over the past few decades. U.S. FDI abroad increased from $238 billion to $6.0 trillion, while FDI in the United States rose from $184 billion to $4.0 trillion. The main destinations for U.S. FDI outflows include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and Ireland. Europe accounts for nearly 60% of U.S. outward FDI, while 68% of FDI in the United States comes from Europe. U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-technology, finance, and services, while inward FDI is mainly in the manufacturing sector. Economists support unimpeded international flows of capital like FDI for their positive impact on domestic economic activity. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) benefits both home and host countries by enhancing firms' competitive advantages, skills, and incomes. It also leads to technological advances, capital formation, and a more competitive business environment. FDI contributes to international trade and global economic integration through established multinational corporations (MNCs) operating within global value chains. In 2016, foreign firms' affiliates in the United States played a significant role in trade, jobs, and production. Foreign firms' affiliates in the United States play a significant role in trade, jobs, and production. In 2016, they employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods. These affiliates contributed $894.0 billion value-added to U.S. GDP, with larger annual growth compared to other U.S. firms. Concerns are raised about U.S. firms investing abroad and shifting production overseas, but data on such activities are mostly anecdotal. Most U.S. outward FDI is in high-income developed countries, where production is consumed abroad. U.S. direct investment abroad is not seen to lead to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. The loss of manufacturing jobs is attributed to sector restructuring and domestic economic forces. International investment agreements establish rules for investment protections, with over 2,600 agreements globally aiming to reduce FDI restrictions and ensure fair treatment of investors. U.S. IIAs involve reciprocal commitments for foreign investor protections. The United States has bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with 40 countries, mainly developing ones. The latest BIT ratified with Rwanda in 2012. The U.S. also has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most including investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows investors to bring claims against host countries for alleged violations before an arbitration panel. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is a procedure for resolving disputes between investors and countries, overseen by organizations like the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The number of ISDS cases has increased with global foreign direct investment (FDI) growth. U.S. investors make up a significant portion of these cases, with most claims under NAFTA. The use of ISDS has sparked debate in recent U.S. trade negotiations, with the Trump Administration making changes to ISDS provisions in the NAFTA renegotiation. The proposed USMCA would eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada, with specific limits for Mexico. ISDS was a major point of contention in T-TIP talks. The EU is pushing for an investment court system in its trade agreements. CFIUS oversees foreign investment transactions for U.S. national security. Established in 1975, CFIUS gained formal review authority in 1988. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act established CFIUS in 2007 to review FDI transactions affecting homeland security and critical industries. The President can block transactions, with this authority being used five times since 1988. Recent examples include blocking acquisitions of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Qualcomm. The FIRRMA of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review under CFIUS. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act established CFIUS in 2007 to review FDI transactions affecting homeland security and critical industries. The President can block transactions, with this authority being used five times since 1988. Recent examples include blocking acquisitions of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Qualcomm. The FIRRMA of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review under CFIUS, including non-controlling investments in U.S. businesses involved in critical technology or infrastructure. Some have objected to this expansion, citing concerns about an open investment climate. Additionally, various programs such as OPIC, the BUILD Act, and SelectUSA promote both inward and outward FDI through political risk insurance, financing, and coordination of federal efforts to attract investments. SelectUSA facilitates FDI in the United States by providing information to businesses and EDOs, resolving federal program issues, and advocating for investments in the US."
