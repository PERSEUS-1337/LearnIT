    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on differences in the risk characteristics of enrollees. This helps level the playing field by ensuring fair payments based on factors like gender, age, geography, health status, and tobacco use. The report describes how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, including risk adjustment for factors like age, geography, and health status. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B, with capitated monthly payments adjusted for demographics and health status. The Medicare Advantage plan offers capitated monthly payments to private health plans based on estimated costs and benchmarks set by CMS. Payments are adjusted for factors like age, geography, and health status of enrolled beneficiaries. The Medicare Advantage plan offers capitated monthly payments to private health plans based on estimated costs and benchmarks set by CMS. Payments are adjusted for factors like age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability of enrollees. CMS determines risk adjustment for MA plan payments using demographic and health factors identified in the current year. The process of incorporating health status into Medicare Advantage plan payments involves using ICD-9-CM codes to map diagnostic groups into condition categories, which are hierarchically organized based on clinical severity and cost. This system ensures that only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. The Medicare Advantage plan payments incorporate health status using ICD-9-CM codes to map diagnostic groups into condition categories hierarchically organized by clinical severity and cost. Hierarchical coding ensures the most costly disease dictates reimbursement. Only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. The Medicare Advantage plan payments use ICD-9-CM codes to categorize health conditions hierarchically based on severity and cost. The coding system prioritizes the most expensive disease for reimbursement, excluding short-term and non-chronic conditions that are not good predictors of future expenditures. The Medicare Advantage plan uses ICD-9-CM codes to categorize health conditions hierarchically based on severity and cost. The risk score for a beneficiary is calculated by summing individual risk factors, considering disease hierarchy. This score is multiplied by the plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment. Interaction effects between multiple conditions can result in higher costs than just their additive effects. Empirical investigation has shown interaction effects between certain diseases and disability, leading to higher healthcare costs for individuals with disabilities and diabetes. CMS incorporates these interactions into the CMS-HCC model, adjusting payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model predicting expenditures based on diagnoses, demographic variables, and interactions between diseases and permanent disability. The model uses actual claims data for Medicare Parts A and B, refining over the years to determine relative risk factors for each variable. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, using actual claims data to determine relative risk factors for each variable. Risk scores can be standardized to reflect individual health status and likely costs, allowing for individualized payment adjustments. The CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses. New enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility have rates based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. CMS collects data from MA plans to update the risk score of each beneficiary. The CMS adjusts Medicare Advantage payments based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses. Risk scores are updated twice a year using encounter level data, including dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes. Errors in payments can stem from age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease. Demographic data and Medicaid eligibility are sourced from administrative files. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans to ensure that risk-adjusted payments are supported by medical records. Previously, audits only sought to recover errors in payments for sampled enrollees, but in 2011, CMS proposed extrapolating error rates to the entire plan contract, aiming for $2.27 billion in savings over five years. In 2010, CMS released a methodology for auditing data submitted by plans, and in 2012, they released further details on the process. In 2012, CMS finalized the payment error calculation methodology for Medicare Advantage plans, allowing for extrapolation of audit findings to estimate payment errors for entire contracts. Audits are conducted at the contract level, involving sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. CMS uses a sample size of 201 enrollees drawn from eligible beneficiaries enrolled in the contract in January of the payment year. Enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans must meet specific criteria to be eligible for risk-adjusted payments, including continuous enrollment, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, Medicare Part B coverage, and specific diagnosis codes. Eligible enrollees are divided into three groups for sampling, with 67 randomly selected from the highest risk scores. The sample for auditing eligible enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans is divided into three groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 randomly selected enrollees, with sampling weights used to represent the population. Enrollee sampling weights are then used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the entire population. The MA plan is informed of the audited enrollees and their HCC codes, and must provide evidence from medical records to substantiate each HCC code they were paid for. The MA plan has 12 weeks to provide medical records for audited enrollees to substantiate HCC codes for risk-adjusted payments. If the records confirm the diagnosis, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Plans can appeal findings, but the final decision is binding unless reviewed by the CMS Administrator. Payment errors are categorized as positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment), with underpayments needing evidence in the initial record as they cannot be supported later. The MA plan has 12 weeks to provide medical records for audited enrollees to substantiate HCC codes for risk-adjusted payments. Payment errors are categorized as positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment), with underpayments needing evidence in the initial record as they cannot be supported later. Enrollee-level payment errors are corrected based on supported HCCs from RADV medical record reviews. The payment error is calculated for each sampled enrollee based on the number of months enrolled in the MA contract during the payment year. Weighted enrollee payment errors are summed to determine an estimated payment error for the MA contract. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster. The FFS adjuster addresses differences in documentation standards used in RADV audits and the risk adjustment model. The error for each of the 201 sampled enrollees is calculated by weighting them relative to the plan and adjusting for the time they were in the plan. The errors for all sampled enrollees are then summed to determine the estimated plan level error. In a hypothetical example, the estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50 with a 99% confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. The recovery amount is determined by the lower bound of the confidence interval adjusted by a fee-for-service adjuster, ensuring no additional payment to MA plans. The academic study and research by MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage. Plans may manipulate enrollment to receive higher reimbursements for below-average cost beneficiaries. MedPAC is worried that certain plans may enroll high-cost individuals but be reimbursed for average-cost enrollees. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process for CMS's risk adjustment model in Medicare Advantage. They highlighted issues with the validation of fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments and the methodology's impact on premiums not reflecting actual enrollees' risk profiles. The AAA emphasized the importance of consistency in developing and applying risk adjustment factors. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed using FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply these factors only to validated MA data, which could lead to inadequate payments if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic. This discrepancy in data could result in understated risk scores and potentially impact payment accuracy for diabetic members. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency in risk adjustment for MA plans, which may lead to underpayment and payment inequities. The proposed RADV payment-error calculations could result in a modified payment methodology that does not accurately reflect the risk profile of enrollees. The addition of a fee-for-service adjuster in the final calculation methodology may address these concerns. Plans enrolling sicker or healthier Medicare beneficiaries may be under or overcompensated. Concerns have been raised about using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients. Some plans fear financial risk from RADV audit recoveries. Different models have been used for risk adjustment in Medicare private plans. Table A-1 displays risk adjustment models used for Medicare private plan payments, along with the year of use and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The models aim to predict beneficiary spending based on their characteristics, with the R2 indicating how well the model explains the variation in expenditures. The first model, AAPCC, has an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of the expenditure variation. Subsequent models used by CMS have increased the percentage of variation explained. The most recent proposed model by CMS can explain approximately 12.5% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures. The Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) model used prior to 2000 accounted for demographic variables but explained less than 1% of expenditure variation. This model did not consider beneficiary health costs or adjust payments for enrolling very ill beneficiaries. Overall, private plan enrollees were healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology that considered beneficiary health status by January 1, 2000. The Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model was used from 2000 to 2003, taking into account the worst principal inpatient diagnosis. However, the model had limitations such as not counting illnesses with high expenditures that did not result in hospital admissions. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which considers severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. The CMS-HCC model explains nearly 10% of beneficiary expenditure variation and is updated annually. The CMS-HCC model is updated annually to account for changes in diagnosis codes and expenditure data. Version 12 increased the explanatory power to nearly 11%, while Version 21, implemented in 2012 for PACE plans, further improved predictive power to approximately 12.5% through clinical revisions and adjustments for changes in disease patterns and treatment methods."
