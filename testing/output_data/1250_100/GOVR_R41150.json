    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, totaling $33.5 billion in appropriations. Additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act remained to be expended. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget totaled $35.3 billion. The House and Senate proposed bills for Energy and Water Development programs, with the Senate reporting a total of $35.0 billion. A continuing resolution was passed on September 30 to fund government programs. The government passed multiple resolutions to fund government programs at various levels until FY2011. The House and Senate proposed different funding levels for Energy and Water Development programs, with the Senate proposing $35.0 billion. After several extensions and amendments, H.R. 1473 was passed and signed into law on April 15, 2011. The Energy and Water Development bill, signed into law as P.L. 112-10, funds programs at $32.2 billion. It includes funding for various agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and independent agencies. Tables provide budget details for FY2004 to FY2011, and discuss key issues in the major programs. Funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in FY2011 was below the agency's final appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion, while the House Appropriations Subcommittee allocated $5.28 billion. The House-passed Continuing Resolution proposed reducing funding to approximately $4.8 billion, but the final Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion, $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. In FY2011, funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was $152 million higher than the President's request but $411 million lower than the FY2010 enacted level. Unlike other infrastructure programs, Corps funds are not distributed based on a formula or through competitive programs. Approximately 85% of the appropriations for civil works activities are directed to specific projects, some of which are identified in the budget request while others are added during congressional deliberations. The agency's funding is often debated in relation to earmarks, with appropriations typically not provided to projects that have not been previously authorized in a Water Resources Development Act. The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion, leading to policy questions about the alignment between authorization and appropriations. Annual appropriations for the Corps' Civil Works program have been regularly augmented since Hurricane Katrina through supplemental appropriations and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, totaling approximately $18.7 billion. This includes funds for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. The Corps received $5.76 billion in FY2009 for Louisiana hurricane protection and $797 million in supplemental appropriations for flood control and coastal emergencies in 2009. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the Corps with an extra $4.6 billion for FY2009 and FY2010. Construction funding for the Corps is a focus for Congress due to the alignment between authorization and appropriations. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $1.69 billion for Corps construction, a $341 million reduction from FY2010. The request limited new construction starts, with two new starts included. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, using $120 million from prior year balances. They included one new start but no others. The House subcommittee bill did not include further details. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $1.69 billion for Corps construction, a $341 million reduction from FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, with one new start included. P.L. 112-10 provided $1.78 billion for construction, slightly more than requested. The bill also included a provision barring the Corps from using appropriations for new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit, with needed funding exceeding incoming collections. The FY2011 Obama Administration proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, instead of implementing a lock user fee. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach but agreed to budget only current year fuel tax revenues. The Corps plays a significant role in coordinating the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with funding coming from Energy and Water Development appropriations and Department of the Interior appropriations. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing it to $155 million due to delays in project spending. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts. The FY2011 budget request included reductions for various Corps accounts, such as Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The Obama Administration also requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account, and the Bureau of Reclamation's FY2011 request totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The FY2011 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation is $1.182 billion, including $1.015 billion in net discretionary authority and $167 million from other funds. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, with the 2010 enacted bill at $1.129 billion. Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account covers various programs and projects. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, with amendments that could impact dam removal studies and funding for biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and the California State Project. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous dams and water diversion projects in the West, providing water to millions of acres of farmland and a population of 31 million. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in 17 western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. However, their operations are often controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The Bureau of Reclamation, a major water supplier in the West, faces challenges in balancing water needs and maintaining infrastructure. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California is a complex project affected by drought and environmental restrictions, leading to limitations on water deliveries. Efforts to prevent new Biological Opinions on project impacts have been made in past appropriations bills. An amendment in FY2010 appropriations aimed to prevent restrictions on operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) due to recent BiOps. These BiOps found that the 2004 OCAP plan jeopardized Delta Smelt and salmon species. Factors like increased pumping, invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals have contributed to fishery declines. Low water deliveries to certain districts have resulted in court-imposed limits on pumping. The FY2010 enacted bill included an amendment allowing water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for conveyance declined, while funding for water use efficiency and science increased substantially. The enacted Continuing Resolution (P.L. 112-10) provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request for water use efficiency and science funding. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, an increase of $56.2 million over FY2010, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund received an allocation of $72.1 million for FY2011, with additional funding of $8 million proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The goal of the settlement is to restore salmon runs and mitigate water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term contractors. Construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration and dewatered parts of the river. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision to withhold funding for the settlement implementation exceeding $88 million authorized in P.L. 111-11. The WaterSMART Program proposed by Reclamation for FY2011 includes three components: WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects, with a total proposed funding of $62 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup decreased the funding level for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding for Title XVI Projects, providing $20 million for WaterSMART/Challenge Grants, $4 million for Basin Studies, and $7.7 million for Title XVI projects. The Energy and Water Development bill has historically funded DOE programs, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with some ARRA funds remaining unexpended in FY2010. In FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for DOE programs, but the final legislation appropriated $26.3 billion. DOE administers various programs, with the most important ones being described. The EERE programs received $1,825.6 million in FY2011, a reduction of $416.9 million. Additionally, $144.7 million was provided for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability programs, a cut of $27.3 million. The DOE requested $50 million for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE to train a skilled clean energy workforce. The program aims to address the lack of education in emerging energy trades and increase U.S. competitiveness by developing green technology programs at universities and community colleges. The $50 million request includes $35 million for a higher education subprogram to support the development of professionals in the clean energy field. The $50 million request for the RE-ENERGYSE program includes funding for fellowships, internships, post-doctoral opportunities, interdisciplinary masters programs, technical training, education, and outreach subprograms. It also supports K-12 education activities to educate and inspire students to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable energy practices. The FY2010 proposal for the program was not funded by Congress. The FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal lacked sufficient details and background research, leading to zero funding recommendation by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Instead, they recommended $7.5 million for a study by the Department of Energy to define education and workforce needs and assess program complementarity with other federal agencies. The conference report for FY2010 also provided no funding for the program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the Solar Program in FY2010 and FY2011. However, in the FY2011 request, there was a proposed net funding increase of $55.4 million, with the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) subprogram receiving the majority of the increase to support a demonstration project. This project aims to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, adding about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. The Photovoltaic (PV) R&D Program would also receive an increase of $23.5 million for the PV Manufacturing Initiative to accelerate technology cost reduction and commercialization. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project, with a net increase of $42.5 million for the Wind Program. A new activity for offshore wind development would receive $49.0 million to address various barriers. DOE anticipates accelerating market deployment of over three gigawatts of offshore projects. The Geothermal Program would see an increase of $11.0 million to support collaborative R&D activities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for various energy programs, including geothermal R&D efforts addressing induced seismicity and water availability. They also recommended increased funding for low temperature geothermal systems and the Vehicle Technologies Program, specifically for lithium batteries in electric vehicles. The Building Technologies Program would also receive a net increase in funding. The Systems Design Hub would receive a modest increase in funding from $22.0 million to $24.3 million in FY2011. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $8.7 million less than the request for the Buildings Program, with a lower amount for the Building Design Hub. The Industrial Technologies Program would see a net increase of $4.0 million, including funding for a Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would increase by $10.3 million to support DOE efforts to meet energy goals. The Independence and Security Act (EISA, P.L. 110-140) and Executive Orders 13423 and 13514 guide DOE efforts at sites, focusing on energy assessments, commissioning projects, fugitive emissions capture, and pilot projects for alternative energy sources. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding similar to the request, with a $90.0 million increase for the Weatherization Program to support weatherization of low-income households. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding similar to the request for the Weatherization Program, with a $90.0 million increase to support weatherization of low-income households. The State Energy Program would have increased by $25.0 million to expand current activities, while the Facilities Program would have had a net increase of $38.5 million, mainly for the Energy Systems Integration Facility at NREL. Program Direction would have increased by $60.0 million, with a significant portion allocated for salaries and benefits to handle active contracts and agreements. DOE expects transactions to double from FY2009 to FY2011. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with $21.0 million going to the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis subprogram. The increase would focus on policy analysis for EE and RE technologies as solutions to climate change. Cross-cutting projects and the Low-Carbon Energy Systems project would be supported. Another $15.0 million would expand support for international efforts. The FY2011 increase for Program Support would expand support for the International subprogram, focusing on energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil. New initiatives would include global technology deployment and climate change mitigation, such as the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum. The funding would also support regional partnerships like APEC, ECPA, EDIN, and bilateral partnerships with countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina to advance EE and RE technology RDD&D. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended cuts to various programs, including a $37.0 million reduction for the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program and a $16.9 million cut for the Market Transformation subprogram. They also suggested restoring funding for the Water Power Program to FY2010 levels, despite a proposed $9.5 million cut. This program focuses on developing technologies for generating electricity from marine and hydrokinetic resources. The DOE's FY2010 funds are enough to continue assessments and start new projects. The Senate Committee recommended additional funding, with a focus on conventional hydropower. There were cuts to Industrial Programs, with a shift towards cross-cutting technology efforts. The Industries of the Future program received less funding than in FY2010 but more than the request. The FY2011 request included $185.9 million for the Office of Electricity Delivery. The FY2011 request for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability included a $13.9 million increase, with a focus on growing the Energy Storage subprogram by $26.0 million. Energy storage is seen as a solution to electric power infrastructure issues, with research efforts directed towards lithium-based batteries for stationary applications. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the exact amount of the request for programs, with an additional $4.3 million added. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $824.1 million, including advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. P.L. 112-10 provided $732.1 million for those programs, with an additional $88.2 million requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. Critics argue that the nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The FY2011 nuclear energy budget request included new priorities such as the Reactor Concepts Research, Development and Demonstration Program for small modular reactors. Fuel Cycle Research and Development saw a 47.8% increase to focus on spent nuclear fuel disposal and cycle options. A new program called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) was proposed with a $99.3 million budget for research on advanced nuclear power concepts. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy included funding for various nuclear technologies, advanced reactor concepts, and international cooperation. The budget split Generation IV R&D between NEET and Reactor Concepts RD&D, with $5 million allocated for university nuclear education. The Reactor Concepts RD&D program included the NGNP demonstration project and research on advanced reactors, with a total funding request of $195 million. New programs were established for small modular reactors and enhancing the sustainability of existing nuclear plants. The funding request for Reactor Concepts RD&D, including the NGNP high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project, was $195 million. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2010 did not mention NGNP specifically, but Congress allocated $169 million. The FY2011 budget included $103 million for NGNP, with plans for final design and construction decision by the end of FY2011. The Advanced Reactor Concepts program had a funding request of $21.9 million. The budget justification describes a program focusing on advanced nuclear reactors for improved sustainability, safety, and economics. It includes fast reactors and reactors using various heat-transfer fluids. International collaboration will continue through the Generation IV International Forum. The DOE requested $38.9 million for the Small Modular Reactors Program, aiming to build smaller, factory-made reactors for cost reduction and easier financing. DOE plans to award financial assistance for up to two Small Modular Reactor (SMR) designs to make them easier to finance. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program will receive $25.8 million to research extending the life of existing reactors beyond 60 years. The program will focus on studying aging reactor materials, analyzing safety margins, and improving plant efficiency. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program will receive $201 million for long-term research on managing spent nuclear fuel. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) focused on developing spent fuel reprocessing technology to recycle plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials into new nuclear fuel. Under the Obama Administration, the program aims to explore a wider range of nuclear fuel cycle approaches, including direct disposal of spent fuel and recycling options. Research will also be conducted on storage, transportation, and disposal of nuclear waste to support alternatives to the Yucca Mountain repository. Nuclear Future is developing alternatives to the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository, which President Obama wants to terminate. The program will research waste treatment technologies, geologic disposal media, advanced fuels for reactors, nuclear waste characteristics, modeling fuel cycle options, and a range of nuclear energy technology issues. The NEET program will focus on nuclear energy technology research, while Crosscutting Technology Development will explore reactor materials, weapons proliferation risks, nuclear plant manufacturing methods, and sensors. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation will be moved from the Generation IV program. The Modeling and Simulation Hub, created in FY2010, is to be moved to NEET with increased funding of $24.3 million. The hub aims to create a computer model of an operating reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology. The Obama Administration requested $586.6 million for Fossil Energy R&D in FY2011, a 12.7% decrease from FY2010. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy plans to propose a new budget structure for the FY2012 Coal subprogram focusing on carbon capture and storage technologies. The DOE merged FutureGen and the Clean Coal Power Initiative into a Carbon Capture Demonstration Initiative funded at $1.52 billion by ARRA. FutureGen project was originally for clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture. DOE abandoned FutureGen and will use $1 billion to refit an existing plant for CO2 capture. The Clean Coal Technology program has only project-closeout activities left, with no further funding requested in FY2011. Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in Fossil Energy budget to $725.95 million, including funding for new projects. The committee allocated $48.15 million for Power Systems and restored the Natural Gas Technologies program. They also funded a new Unconventional Fossil Energy program. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil. By 2010, the SPR was filled to its capacity of 727 million barrels. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil. The SPR has facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Since 1994, the federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR. In 2000, additions to the SPR were made with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquired by the Department of Energy. Congress passed legislation in 2008 ordering DOE to suspend RIK fill unless the price of crude oil dropped below $75/barrel. The Bush Administration announced plans in 2009 to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the SPR to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The RIK fill for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) resumed in May 2009 at 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels by January 2010, reaching capacity. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program in September 2009. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required SPR expansion to 1 billion barrels, with a possible site in Richton, MS for an additional 160 million barrels. The Administration proposed to suspend spending on SPR expansion in its FY2011 request, redirecting $71 million for non-expansion operations and maintenance. The Administration proposed a reduction in funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY2011, citing projections of declining petroleum consumption and dependence on imports. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with a similar proposal for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR and did not support canceling $71 million for the proposed Richton, MS site expansion. P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at $209.9 million but rescinded $86.8 million from prior year appropriations. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in various program areas, making it a significant federal funder of basic research. The DOE is a major federal funder of basic research and physical sciences. In FY2011, the requested budget for the Office of Science was $5.121 billion, with various recommendations and appropriations made by different Congress sessions. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The requested 4.4% increase for FY2011 was lower than previous years. The requested funding for the largest Office of Science program, basic energy sciences, was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from FY2010. Funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) would have increased by $40 million. A new energy innovation hub on materials for batteries and energy storage would have received $34 million, and the existing hub on fuels from sunlight would have received $24 million. The Administration proposed to initiate a total of eight energy innovation hubs in FY2010, but Congress funded only three. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for basic energy sciences, high-energy physics, and biological and environmental research. The requested funding for basic energy sciences was $1.739 billion, with no increase for new EFRCs. For high-energy physics, the request was $829 million, including funding for construction projects at Fermilab. The request for biological and environmental research was $627 million, with proposed increases for climate and Earth research. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding increases for various research areas. This included $16 million for climate and Earth system modeling, $11 million for genomic science, and $15 million transferred to the nuclear physics program for nuclear medicine research. The proposed funding for biological and environmental research was limited to $302 million, while nuclear physics received a 5.0% increase to $562 million. Construction at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) would receive $36 million, with some activities funded by the Recovery Act. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $554 million for advanced scientific computing research, with a proposed increase of $35 million for leadership computing facilities. The request for fusion energy sciences was $380 million, down 10.8% from the previous year due to delays in the construction schedule of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The U.S. contribution to ITER would have dropped from $135 million to $80 million in FY2011. The estimated project cost for ITER is $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. The start-up date for ITER was delayed to November 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences in the 111th Congress. ARPA-E was authorized to support energy technology research projects and received $179.6 million in funding. The FY2011 budget requested $300 million for ARPA-E, but only $179.6 million was appropriated. President Obama's budget called for terminating the DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, including the Yucca Mountain repository project. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, but it was rejected by the NRC. No funding for Yucca Mountain or OCRWM was requested in FY2011. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, which is now being considered by the full NRC commission. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to evaluate alternatives to Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal. The Commission will study options for temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of nuclear waste, with a draft report due in 18 months and a final report in two years. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities and conduct research on disposal technologies. Substantial funding has been requested for these efforts. The DOE is facing challenges in meeting deadlines for nuclear waste disposal, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion. The Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program was established to support energy projects. Congress is exploring alternatives to Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal. Sec. 1703 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized loan guarantees for energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed tripling the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. Federal loan guarantees are crucial for financing new nuclear power plants. The nuclear industry pushed for a dramatic increase in the loan guarantee ceiling to secure financing for new nuclear power plants. The Department of Energy announced a preliminary nuclear loan guarantee for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, totaling $8.33 billion for two reactors. Critics argue that tripling nuclear loan guarantees would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a temporary loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act established a loan guarantee program for energy projects, with $6 billion initially allocated for subsidy costs. $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program, $1.5 billion was rescinded for other purposes, leaving $2.5 billion for loan guarantees. An additional $500 million was requested for renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees. The Department of Energy requested $58 million for administrative costs related to loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. The loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies was reduced to $7.3 billion, with an additional $2 billion available for renewable energy and efficiency projects. The Section 1705 loan guarantee program subsidy cost payments are set to expire, but $170 million was provided for renewable energy projects with no expiration date. Additionally, up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy and efficiency projects was authorized. The DOE program 112-10 provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for plant capacity investments. The program's administrative expenses were covered by P.L. 112-10. The Stockpile Stewardship Program ensures the preservation of US nuclear weapons competencies. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the US nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It includes activities such as weapons design, system integration, manufacturing, security, and reliability assessment. The program aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the stockpile while reducing the likelihood of nuclear testing. The stockpile management program supports the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the US nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It involves activities at the nuclear weapons complex, consisting of three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) for FY2012-FY2015. The Complex, consisting of eight sites, has undergone reductions since the Cold War. Congress has pushed for further changes such as fewer personnel, lower costs, and increased security. NNSA's \"Complex 2030\" plan faced criticism from the House Appropriations Committee in FY2008 for lacking a comprehensive strategy and expenditure plan. The Senate Appropriations also raised concerns about rebuilding the complex without considering long-term efficiency and consolidation. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the NNSA's Complex Transformation plan for lacking a comprehensive strategy and premature deployment. The plan aimed to reduce the weapons program footprint, close or transfer structures, reduce weapons workers, dismantle weapons faster, and build new facilities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and several programs in FY2009. They insisted on a new nuclear deterrent strategy focused on current and future threats, determining the size of the nuclear stockpile and weapons complex needed to support it. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating RRW funds in FY2009 and made changes to individual programs. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, with the Administration proposing to cancel RRW development. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. Funding for Weapons Activities is set to increase substantially to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. The New START treaty was supported by Senate Republicans in exchange for this increase in funding. The New START treaty in November 2010 outlined a budget plan for increasing funding for Weapons Activities to ensure the safety and reliability of the US nuclear arsenal. The President's FY2012 budget requested $7,629.7 million for Weapons Activities, with concerns raised about potential funding cuts. The issue was resolved in P.L. 112-10 for FY2011, providing $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities, including programs for maintaining, refurbishing, and conducting R&D on nuclear weapons in the stockpile. The DSW programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009, and an ongoing LEP for the W76 warhead is termed the W76-1. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million. The Stockpile Systems program involves routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, ongoing assessment, and the like for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2010 appropriation was $357.8 million, and the FY2011 request was $649.4 million, with the largest increase for the B61 bomb. The requested amount for Stockpile Systems program includes substantial increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. The B61 funds are divided into system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study. The latter aims to support a life extension study for nuclear and non-nuclear components, enhancing safety and compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a specific allocation for surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. The B61 bomb has several variants, including a controversial new variant called the B61-12. The House bill recommended no funds for the B61-12, citing the need for a clearly defined nuclear weapons strategy. The Senate bill included the requested amount for the B61-12. The conference bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, with $32.5 million designated for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. Upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review and confirmation of the requirement for the B61-12, the NNSA is authorized to reallocate additional funds. The NNSA is authorized to reallocate an additional $15,000,000 within Stockpile Systems activities to support the continuation of the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study, with approval required from the Appropriations Committees. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2011 and directed NNSA to submit a report on safety and security features for a refurbished B61. The NNSA is directed to submit a revised analysis of B61 LEP alternatives on costs and benefits, including combining nuclear and nonnuclear refurbishment. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) involves dismantling warheads and disposing of components and materials. The FY2011 budget request for WDD is $58.0 million, reflecting a decrease in dismantlements and component dispositions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million for WDD. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) in FY 2010, with $27.5 million allocated to help restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. WDD activities include the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) for converting plutonium pits to oxide for use in nuclear reactors. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes into solids for disposal off-site. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Services was $828.8 million, with the largest increase in funding for Plutonium Sustainment. This increase aimed to maintain plutonium technical base skills and restore the capability to build up to 10 pits per year. The FY2011 request for Stockpile Services was $941.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the FY2011 request for Stockpile Services by $30.5 million. The funds provided should be used for surveillance, plutonium sustainment, and weapons assembly at Pantex. These efforts support the nuclear weapons stockpile work and scientific infrastructure. The Science Campaign aims to improve warhead performance assessment and readiness for nuclear tests. It also funds experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The Science Campaign, funded at $365.2 million in FY2011, aims to enhance scientific capabilities for assessing nuclear weapons without underground testing. The Advanced Certification program will receive a significant increase to improve weapons certification processes and conduct experiments at various facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in funding, with allocations for the Z facility at Sandia and plutonium experiments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funding by $8.0 million for the Z facility in Albuquerque, NM, to conduct experiments on plutonium. This facility releases a significant amount of energy to study material reactions under high temperature and pressure, crucial for maintaining a safe nuclear stockpile. The Engineering Campaign aims to enhance nuclear weapon safety, reliability, and performance without underground testing, with a focus on predicting responses to external stimuli and aging effects. The FY2011 appropriation was $141.9 million, with a recommended increase to $150.0 million. The committee provided funds for capabilities to simulate a nuclear environment in support of the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign. This campaign aims to create high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory for weapons-related research and to attract scientific talent. The centerpiece of the campaign is the National Ignition Facility (NIF), the world's largest laser, which aims to achieve thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory. Despite initial controversy and technical issues, NIF was dedicated in May 2009. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) was dedicated in May 2009. In January 2010, scientists successfully fired 192 laser beams at a helium-filled target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. This marked a significant advance in their work at the $3.5 billion facility. The FY2010 appropriation was $457.9 million, with a $481.5 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and supported the creation of an independent advisory board for NIF experiments. The Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign aims to develop computational models for nuclear weapons testing. Some analysts doubt simulation can certify warhead safety, advocate testing. FY2010 appropriation $567.6 million; FY2011 request $615.7 million. Senate Appropriations Committee recommended amount. Readiness Campaign improves manufacturing safety, efficiency, reduces costs. FY2010 appropriation $100.0 million; FY2011 request $112.1 million. Stockpile Readiness subprogram ensures future manufacturing capabilities. Largest increase for lithium parts manufacturing at Y-12 National Security Complex. Largest decrease for FY2010 $68.2 million. The largest dollar decrease for FY2010 was $68.2 million, with $50.2 million requested for FY2011 for Tritium Readiness. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Tritium Readiness funding to $30.2 million due to technical challenges in tritium production. This program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with the FY2010 appropriation at $1,842.9 million and the FY2011 request at $1,849.0 million. Operations of Facilities is the largest subprogram, with $1,348.3 million in FY2010 and a request of $1,258.0 million for FY2011. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. Operations of Facilities saw a decrease in Institutional Site Support funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for RTBF to avoid layoffs and disruptions at facilities like Pantex and Y-12. The committee restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which would replace the over 50-year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building. The House Appropriations Committee stated that proceeding with the CMRR project as currently designed would strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee mentioned that the current authorization basis for the existing CMR facility lasts only through 2010 and does not provide adequate worker safety. The existing CMR facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory is inadequate for worker safety and containment precautions, with funding cuts causing delays in building a replacement. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for the CMRR project due to uncertainty about stockpile requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $125.0 million for CMRR to address previous funding shortfalls and improve operational capabilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for various programs under Weapons Activities, including Secure Transportation Asset, Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response, and Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) focuses on restoring and revitalizing the physical infrastructure of the nuclear security enterprise by eliminating legacy deferred maintenance. The FY2010 appropriation was $93.9 million, with the FY2011 request at $94.0 million. Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and energy efficiency, with a FY2010 request of $90.4 million. The House bill included $62.4 million, while the Senate bill had $61.3 million and denied funding for stewardship planning due to poorly defined mission priorities. The FY2011 request was $105.5 million, recommended to be reduced by $5.0 million by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Safeguards and Security includes Defense Nuclear Security for operations and maintenance. Defense Nuclear Security provides operations, maintenance, and construction funds for protective forces, physical security systems, and personnel security. The FY2010 appropriation was $769.0 million, with a reduction in the FY2011 request to $720.0 million due to efficiencies. Cyber Security aims to ensure information technology and management security safeguards are in place, with a FY2010 appropriation of $122.5 million. The FY2011 request was $124.3 million. The FY2011 request for DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs was $124.3 million, with funding for these programs in FY2010 at $2.137 billion. The increase in funding was mainly due to returning major construction projects to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $317.3 million in FY2010 and requested $351.6 million for FY2011. Nonproliferation and International Security programs, including international safeguards and export controls, had a FY2011 request of $155.9 million. The FY2011 request for international nonproliferation programs was $155.9 million, compared to $187.2 million in FY2010. The International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program received $572.1 million in FY2010 and requested $590.1 million for FY2011. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program aimed to shut down Russian reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium, with two reactors already closed in 2008. The Fissile Materials Disposition program focused on converting U.S. surplus weapons plutonium into fuel for commercial power reactors. The Obama Administration requested funding for the construction of a facility to convert plutonium to \"mixed-oxide\" reactor fuel at Savannah River, SC, and a similar program in Russia. The program aimed to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium using Russian fast reactors under nonproliferation restrictions. Funding for the program was controversial for several years, but in FY2010, $701.9 million was allocated. In FY2011, $1,030.7 million was requested to continue construction at Savannah River and for research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia under the plutonium disposal agreement. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities, including disposal of radioactive waste and surplus materials. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at over 100 federal facilities across the US, with complex facilities requiring continued cleanup for years or even decades. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at over 100 federal facilities across the US, with complex facilities requiring continued cleanup for years or even decades. As of FY2010, there were 18 facilities where cleanup was not yet complete, with estimated costs ranging between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operating and maintaining cleanup remedies and monitoring contaminant levels. Some facilities have been transferred to other offices within DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at over 100 federal facilities across the US. Responsibility for cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) is transferred to the Corps, funded within the civil works budget. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles activities for the first two years, then jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. The Department's Office of Legacy Management administers long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities at FUSRAP sites. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management comes from three appropriations accounts. The Office of Environmental Management, established in 1989 by the DOE, consolidates cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at over 100 federal facilities across the US. Funding for the Office comes from three appropriations accounts. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 included $5.69 billion for the Office, a decrease from the President's request and FY2010 enacted appropriation. Additionally, $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years were rescinded. The DOE's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, including Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, require significant funding for cleanup due to high-level radioactive waste storage. These facilities have complex cleanup challenges and are expected to need funding for decades. Cleanup at Hanford may not be complete until 2062, Savannah River Site until 2040, and Idaho National Laboratory until 2044, with substantial volumes of high-level radioactive waste stored at these sites. According to a 2009 DOE estimate, there are significant amounts of high-level radioactive waste stored at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. The challenges of removing and treating these wastes for disposal, along with delays in waste treatment facility construction, raise environmental concerns. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked waste into groundwater that flows into the Columbia River, prompting ongoing water quality monitoring. Funding sources for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities are also being scrutinized. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to pay for the cleanup of facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and payments from the federal government to finance the fund, based on the premise that both parties benefitted from the production of enriched uranium. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established to clean up facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments to finance the fund. The fund balance may not be enough for future cleanup costs, with $4.5 billion available but DOE estimating $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needed. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in the FY2011 budget to increase cleanup resources. The FY2011 budget request includes a proposal to increase resources for cleanup, with estimated assessments of $200 million in FY2011 and $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. The federal government's authority to collect assessments depends on Congress enacting reauthorizing legislation. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments. The President requested $730.5 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from proposed nuclear utility assessments. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations from the Fund in FY2011. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, which was a decrease from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million but noted the lack of legislation to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts. The federal payment to the Fund was $33.6 million, lower than the President's request of $496.7 million, and was made through a transfer of funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The Committee recommended a smaller federal payment to fulfill the remaining balance of the required federal contribution to the Fund. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. Additional federal funds may be needed for future cleanup. Responsibility for long-term maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, funded through the Other Defense Activities Account. In FY2011, $788.4 million was allocated for this account, with $188.6 million recommended for the Office of Legacy Management in the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011, the same as the President requested but slightly less than the $189.8 million appropriation enacted for FY2010. Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to rise over time as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power generated by dams operated by federal agencies for various purposes. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) prioritize providing power to municipal utilities, cooperatives, and other public bodies at low rates. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a decrease of $4 million from FY2010. PMAs' receipts were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary, requiring SWPA and WAPA to request additional funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, funding was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with collections from Colorado River basins totaling $23 million. The FY2011 budget for Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) includes $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. BPA is a self-funded agency that receives no appropriations but funds some activities through borrowing authority. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased BPA's borrowing authority to $7.7 billion. Additionally, ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) for activities authorized in section 402. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) with borrowing authority for building new transmission lines for renewable energy resources. WAPA can borrow up to $3.25 billion from the Treasury on a permanent basis. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011 for safety regulation and licensing of nuclear reactors. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.052.3 billion for FY2011 for safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. The budget included $272.5 million for new reactor activities, with an increase to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007, with more possible through 2011. The NRC's proposed budget also included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The NRC's funding request for FY2011 covers costs for adjudicating license withdrawal motions and activities related to the closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support. The budget also includes funding for regulation of operating reactors, reactor safety inspections, license renewals, modifications, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within NRC is set to increase, and 90% of NRC's budget is offset by fees on licensees. The FY2011 funding request for the NRC covers various activities, including adjudicating license withdrawal motions and Yucca Mountain closure support. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing, homeland security, and DOE defense waste oversight are not subject to offsets. The net appropriation for FY2011 would be $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
