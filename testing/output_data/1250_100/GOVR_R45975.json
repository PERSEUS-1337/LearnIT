This led to the establishment of the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974. Currently, the U.S. government is a major donor to global vaccination efforts, providing significant funding for organizations like GAVI. Congressional oversight is focused on the allocation of funds for global child vaccination and the impact on U.S. foreign policy, development, and domestic health security. Child vaccination is crucial for promoting U.S. foreign policy, development, and domestic health security goals. Donor-backed campaigns have successfully reduced mortality in poor countries, with setbacks occasionally faced. In the early 1990s, U.S. assistance led to an 80% immunization rate for DTP3. Progress stalled in the late-1990s due to various reasons. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was launched in 2000 to address declining momentum and funding for immunization campaigns, supporting the immunization of 700 million children since then. Child vaccination is crucial for promoting global health security goals. The United States, as a founding member of GAVI, supports the immunization of 700 million children. Vaccinations are cost-effective in preventing infectious diseases and saving lives. Recommended childhood vaccines can protect against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and reduce disease spread. However, global coverage varies, with high levels of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Vaccine hesitancy has led to increases in VPD cases in some high-income countries. GAVI reports that over 760 million children worldwide were immunized against VPDs from 2000 to 2018. In 2018, 66 million children were immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), with approximately 100 million children immunized each year. By the end of 2018, 20 million infants and children globally had not received the full schedule of recommended vaccines. GAVI estimates that full vaccination coverage could prevent one in seven deaths in under-5 children. Over 1.5 million children die annually from VPDs, with nearly 60% of these deaths occurring in 10 countries. Global child deaths decreased from 12.7 million to 5.8 million between 1990 and 2017, largely due to immunization campaigns. Measles vaccination coverage prevented an estimated 15.6 million deaths from 2000 to 2017. While global coverage for recommended vaccines has increased, DTP3 vaccination rates have stagnated in recent years. In 2018, global DTP3 vaccination coverage for children under one year was 86%. Maternal and neonatal tetanus has seen an 85% reduction in newborn deaths since 2000. Despite improvements in childhood vaccine uptake, most under-5 child deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. 14 countries still have maternal and neonatal tetanus. Global child deaths have decreased significantly due to immunization campaigns. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to alleviate global poverty, improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth by 2030. SDG Goal 3 targets ending preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children, with a focus on reducing under-5 mortality rates to 25 per 1,000 live births in every country. International efforts led by organizations like WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI, with U.S. support, aim to decrease vaccine-preventable deaths among children under five. UNICEF plays a key role in supporting global immunization programs, vaccine supply, quality monitoring, innovation, and disease eradication programs. UNICEF plays a crucial role in global immunization programs, ensuring a reliable supply of vaccines for GAVI-supported initiatives. Their goals align with WHO targets to reach 90% of children under one with routine immunization. WHO's strategic framework on vaccines aims to extend immunization achievements and promote the development of new vaccines and technologies. The WHO develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations through the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and collaborates with GAVI, a public-private partnership aiming to expand global access to vaccines. GAVI's goal is to immunize 300 million children by 2025 and save 5-6 million lives in the long term. Various factors impact global immunization coverage, including vaccine hesitancy, geographic location, inadequate country capacity, and poverty. Vaccine hesitancy and stigma have led to a resurgence of certain vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio and measles, in some countries. Factors contributing to this include reluctance among individuals and religious communities to vaccinate their children. The WHO has identified \"vaccine hesitancy\" as a major global public health threat, with corruption and lack of trust in authority figures playing a role in fueling this hesitancy. Nigeria, for example, struggled to eliminate polio due to these challenges. Vaccination campaigns have faced challenges due to conspiracy theories, vaccine stigma, and ethical concerns. Geographic location and distance from health centers impact vaccination coverage, especially in underserved populations. Disparities in vaccine coverage between urban and rural areas contribute to disease spread. Poverty, socioeconomic status, and social determinants of health also affect vaccination coverage, with low-income countries lagging behind high-income countries. Vaccine inequities due to underfunding, socioeconomic factors, and conflict settings hinder vaccination coverage, leading to higher child mortality rates in poorer families. Fragile health care infrastructure in conflict zones further exacerbates the situation, with 40% of unvaccinated children residing in such areas. Refugee camps also pose challenges with poor living conditions facilitating disease spread. Congress supports global child vaccination programs to eradicate infectious diseases in conflict-affected countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a surge in measles cases has been deadlier than the Ebola outbreak. Funding for immunization activities is provided through annual appropriations for health and foreign operations departments. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are key federal agencies involved in global vaccination efforts. They work with governments to strengthen immunization programs, support supply chain management, and finance research for new vaccines. Their initiatives align with global health strategies and goals. The CDC plays a central role in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases globally, focusing on polio, measles, and other VPDs. Global vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced polio cases, with only Afghanistan and Pakistan reporting wild polio cases in 2018. The CDC's Global Immunization Program is funded primarily for polio eradication efforts. The CDC's global immunization strategy is based on its 2016-2020 Strategic Framework, with five goals focused on disease control, strengthening partnerships, ensuring vaccination quality, improving surveillance, and promoting research. The CDC collaborates with USAID, UNICEF, GAVI, and other stakeholders to implement the strategy, which aligns with various global health initiatives. In FY2019, Congress allocated more funding for CDC global immunization programs than requested by the Trump Administration. The CDC collaborates with USAID and GAVI to focus on global immunization activities for polio eradication, measles, and rubella elimination in high disease burden countries. USAID supports routine immunization campaigns and disease surveillance, including training community volunteers in Ethiopia. The United States provides significant support for multilateral immunization programs through international organizations and GAVI to expand reach and promote collaboration. The United States plays a central role in GAVI, a public-private partnership founded to expand global access to vaccines and prevent deaths from VPDs. The US is GAVI's third largest donor, providing nearly $2 billion of the $21 billion donated since its founding. US funding for GAVI is appropriated through USAID's Global Health Programs account, and the US holds a seat on GAVI's board. During the Obama Administration, funding for GAVI increased annually as per the Administration's requests. However, under the Trump Administration, proposed funding for GAVI decreased to $250 million in FY2019 and FY2020. Despite this, Congress allocated $290 million for GAVI in FY2019, showing continued support for child vaccinations overseas. Concerns have been raised about maintaining progress in preventing communicable diseases due to global outbreaks. Congress may explore the effectiveness of global vaccination campaigns for domestic pandemic preparedness. The global resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and mumps poses a threat to U.S. public health. Recent outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to travelers from abroad and domestic vaccine hesitancy. Congress is discussing the reasons behind these outbreaks, including imported cases from international travelers. There is also a focus on U.S. funding for foreign aid programs supporting immunization, despite proposed cuts to global health funding by the Trump Administration. The Administration requested cuts to global health funding, including for U.S. agencies involved in global vaccination campaigns. Experts express concern about stagnant vaccination coverage and the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, questioning burden sharing and the efficacy of global immunization campaigns."
