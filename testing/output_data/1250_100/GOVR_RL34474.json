    "content": "The period from late 2007 to early 2008 saw tight supplies, strong demand, and high prices for major grains and oilseeds in U.S. and international markets. Wheat and rice export prices surged significantly during this time, with wheat prices rising 44% and rice prices more than doubling. This report examines the factors behind these market conditions and discusses the impact on farm incomes, government programs, food prices, and international food security. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of high commodity prices on food security, particularly for low-income households in import-dependent countries. A global crisis was signaled in 2008 when the executive director of the World Food Program issued an appeal for $500 million to address the worsening food security outlook. In 2008, the World Food Program appealed for $500 million to address the global food crisis caused by rising commodity prices. The UN Secretary General warned of emergency proportions, with the World Bank predicting 100 million people could fall into deeper poverty. The FAO identified 37 countries in crisis, 21 in Africa. By April 22, 2008, the WFP's funding gap had increased to $755 million due to continued price hikes. The rising food prices have deleterious effects on lower-income households and increase costs for livestock feeders and food processors. The high prices are associated with large price volatility, raising risks and costs for grain merchandising. Additionally, high commodity prices have increased the cost of routine hedging activities at commodity futures exchanges, limiting forward contracting opportunities for grain and oilseed producers. Various factors contribute to high market prices, such as weather-related supply shortfalls, unexpected demand surges, and market-distorting government policies. Wheat prices are primarily driven by international weather-related crop failures and low stock levels. Government policies by key foreign producers to limit exports in favor of domestic markets have contributed to higher prices for coarse grains and oilseeds. Growing demand in developing markets and government biofuels policies are key drivers. Panic buying by import-dependent rice buyers, particularly the Philippines, following export restrictions by major rice exporting countries has led to higher rice prices. The \"bull market\" mentality in global markets has also impacted cotton prices. Global economic growth reinforces demand for agricultural commodities, while lack of sustained investment in the agricultural sector hampers long-term productivity and food supply availability. The current commodity market conditions for major U.S. farm program crops, along with price rises in coffee, cocoa, and tea markets, resemble the 1972-1974 period of high inflation, gasoline shortages, and resource depletion concerns. Record oil prices have increased costs along commodity marketing chains, impacting food supply availability. In the current farm commodity bull market, global stocks-relative-to-use ratios for vegetable oils and grain crops are projected to reach historic lows by mid-2008, leading to record price volatility. High commodity prices have raised the cost of doing business, benefiting U.S. farm income but causing concerns for the livestock sector and food processors about grain and oilseed supplies. The high commodity prices have increased costs for commercial elevators, grain merchandisers, and food processors. Consumers from low-income households and import-dependent nations are concerned about food price inflation and the ability of agricultural producers to meet demand. Global stocks for major U.S. program commodities are expected to be at historically low levels before the next harvest in 2008. Global stocks for major U.S. program commodities are projected to fall to the lowest levels since 1981, with record low stocks-to-use ratios. Rice stocks are slightly up from the previous year but still at historically low levels, representing a halving of available supplies since 2000. Pipeline stocks for wheat in the U.S. are estimated to be in a range of 9.5 to 11 million tons. The USDA projects global stocks for major U.S. program commodities to be at record low levels, with rice stocks slightly up but still historically low. U.S. wheat, corn, and soybean ending stocks are estimated to be at lower levels, leading to increased price volatility. Wheat ending stocks are projected to fall to their lowest level since 1947, while corn supplies are impacted by biofuels usage mandates. Cotton is the exception with relatively abundant ending stocks. In 2008/2009, USDA projects global coarse grain stocks tightening, while wheat and rice stocks rebuild slightly due to record harvests. Ending stocks are the difference between total supplies and total disappearance, reflecting supply and demand factors. Expected ending stocks are used as an indicator of price outcomes, with high stocks leading to lower prices and low stocks raising prices. Tight supply situations have driven higher commodity prices globally. Prices in the global marketing chain, including farm gate, futures markets, international ports, wholesale distribution points, and retail prices, vary in speed and volatility. Agricultural futures market contracts respond quickly to new information, while farm prices are influenced by local market conditions. Wholesale and export market prices fall between farm and futures market prices in responsiveness. Futures exchanges allow trading of commodity futures contracts for potential physical delivery at a fixed price on a future date, serving as indicators of commodity price movements. Futures exchanges serve as important barometers of commodity price movements, reacting almost instantaneously to new information on supply and demand expectations. This transparency facilitates price discovery and risk management in the marketing of agricultural commodities. Prices for various commodities reached historic highs in early 2008 at exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade. In early March 2008, soybean oil and rice prices hit all-time highs. Corn and rice contracts were very active, reaching new highs almost daily in April and May. Commodity prices have been rising due to global supply tightening, leading to unprecedented volatility in daily price movements. Corn and wheat futures saw record volatility in 2006 and 2007, with prices and volatility continuing to rise in 2008. The USDA is projecting record high season-average farm prices for major program crops like wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, and soybean products for the current crop year. Prices for minor oilseeds, oats, and hay crops are also expected to approach or surpass previous record highs. Tight market conditions are expected to continue through 2008, leading to higher farm prices in the 2008/2009 marketing year. The USDA reports monthly farm prices, which are less volatile than daily commodity futures prices. Record high prices for major program crops in 2008/2009 have raised concerns among consumer and hunger advocates. Prices are projected to be significantly above the previous five-year average, with some commodities like rice projected to be 155% higher. The FAO predicts a significant rise in food prices, with cereals and oils leading the increase. Export prices for major agricultural commodities have also seen a substantial increase in recent years. This surge in prices is impacting millions of people globally. The surge in food prices, affecting millions globally, is attributed to a \"perfect storm\" of factors including increased demand from emerging economies, competition between biofuels and food production, high fuel prices, climatic shocks like droughts and floods, government policies limiting export supplies, and a weak U.S. dollar. This has led to a decline in global grain production, reduced exportable supplies, and curtailed grain exports from major producers like Australia and the United States. Global grain supplies were severely reduced due to weather conditions affecting major producers like the United States, Canada, European Union, and Eastern Europe. The EU shifted from a net exporter to a net importer of grains in 2007, leading to a decline in global grain supplies. The increasing world population, especially in developing countries like China and India, has led to a permanent increase in global demand for food, particularly higher-value foods like meat and dairy products. This shift in dietary preferences has increased the demand for grains used to feed livestock. The decline in global grain supplies due to weather conditions has led to a surge in U.S. agricultural exports, with the U.S. dollar losing value against other currencies. This has resulted in record bulk shipments and increased corn exports. Record U.S. agricultural exports in 2007/2008 include a significant increase in corn, wheat, sorghum, and rice exports. The decline in the U.S. dollar's value has offset the rise in commodity prices, making U.S. grains and oilseeds attractive. Governments are promoting biofuels to address concerns over high oil prices, energy security, and climate change, with major programs in the United States, Brazil, and the EU. Brazil mandates a minimum use of sugar-cane-based ethanol in its gasoline supply. The EU, Brazil, Thailand, India, and China have established biofuel mandates to increase the use of biofuels in motor fuel. The EU focuses on vegetable-oil-based biodiesel production, while Brazil mandates a blend of biodiesel in diesel oil. The US has extended and expanded its Renewable Fuel Standards to require blending biofuels with conventional fuels. Thailand, India, and China have temporarily suspended their biofuels programs due to high commodity prices and a global food crisis. The Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) in the US mandate increasing biofuel use, with targets of 20.5 billion gallons by 2015 and 36 billion gallons by 2022. The biofuels sector is supported by tax credits, import tariffs, and federally-subsidized programs. Current production is mainly corn-based ethanol, with mandates expanding to include biodiesel and non-corn ethanol. This places pressure on crop production systems, with a projected increase in corn use for ethanol production. The rapid increase in corn demand for ethanol production has led to higher corn prices, affecting other grain prices as well. The rise in biofuel production, particularly in the US, has been a major factor in the increase in global food prices. Studies suggest that the implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standards will further raise corn prices. The FAPRI study estimates that the ethanol tax credit supports corn prices by 11%, and joint implementation of the RFS and TC supports corn prices by about 20%. Effects were also observed for soybean oil, with a projected 73% higher price under the joint RFS-TC scenario. Corn price effects are likely transmitted to the soybean market via competition for land, impacting regions outside the Corn Belt as farmers adjust planting decisions. Another study by CARD found that the RFS and TC supported corn prices by 16%, dependent on petroleum prices. The CARD study found that federal incentives for biofuels policy support corn prices by 16%, with results dependent on petroleum prices. The study did not consider the impact of the U.S. import tariff on Brazilian ethanol or the effects of grants and subsidized loans in the biofuels sector. Director Bruce Babcock noted that the short-run and long-run impacts of federal biofuels policy differ, as ethanol plants will continue operating even if incentives are removed. In the long run, the impacts of federal biofuels policy depend on crude oil prices and the number of ethanol plants constructed. Foreign government policies to limit food exports have inadvertently raised international commodity prices. The WFP reported that many food-exporting countries imposed restrictions on crop exports to stabilize prices, affecting the international rice market. Major rice exporters like Vietnam, India, China, and Egypt limited exports, leading to a significant reduction in available supplies and a surge in prices. Panic buying ensued, with the Philippines aggressively seeking remaining exportable supplies. Similar actions were observed in the international wheat market. In the international wheat market, countries like Ukraine, Argentina, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan implemented export restrictions to control food price inflation and declining supplies. Argentina's government banned wheat and beef exports, slowed corn exports, and heavily taxed soybean exports, leading to a nationwide farmers' strike. The uncertainty in Argentina led to a shift in demand to U.S. suppliers, boosting U.S. export numbers. Argentina's export controls impacted agricultural prospects, with a predicted decline in planted area. Several countries removed barriers to imports and lowered tariffs on foodstuffs to meet domestic food needs. Consumer-oriented actions like freezing commodity prices and issuing income subsidies were taken to help consumers meet their food needs. High petroleum prices have increased operating costs along the marketing chain for agricultural inputs and outputs, inflating prices everywhere. Energy costs accumulate at the retail outlet, leading to higher consumer food prices. High oil prices are a significant factor in driving up food prices. High oil prices are a key factor in driving up food costs, as they raise energy costs and boost the popularity of biofuels. U.S. fiscal policies indirectly contribute to the \"food crisis\" by weakening the U.S. dollar, leading to higher commodity exports and oil prices. The Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts have exacerbated the financial crisis, resulting in a decline in the dollar's value and higher oil prices. The weakening U.S. economy, driven by high oil prices and surging import costs, has impacted capital and stock market prices. This has led to bullish commodity markets attracting speculative investment money, potentially reinforcing rising prices. Agricultural commodity markets are now seen as a safe haven for investors, with record farm income in recent years. According to USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), national net farm cash income is expected to reach a record $96.6 billion in 2008, driven by higher commodity prices. Farm revenue gains are projected to outpace rising input expenses, leaving many farm communities with increased cash flow. Government direct payments are forecasted to be $13.4 billion in 2008, slightly higher than the previous year but below the four-year average. Higher market prices are expected to limit payments under price-triggered programs. Fixed direct payments are estimated to be around $5.3 billion. Government direct payments for crop production are estimated to be slightly higher at $5.8 billion for 2008/2009, down from $6.0 billion in 2007/2008. Commodity prices have unexpectedly increased, leading to higher insurance premiums and the opportunity for producers to lock in high returns. Prices for major program crops in 2008 are substantially higher and more volatile compared to 2007, with corn prices increasing by 29% to $5.25 per bushel. The higher crop insurance premiums in 2008 are due to the higher price level and increased volatility. Farmers can insure higher per acre returns with revenue-based policies. Government support for federal crop insurance increases with higher prices, with subsidies covering 50% to 60% of premiums. Farmers in high-yielding areas like the Corn Belt can guarantee corn revenues of $500 per acre with a 75% coverage level. The insurance companies receive reimbursement for their administrative and operating expenses related to crop insurance policies, which is based on a percentage of total premiums. FAPRI projects an increase in federal outlays from $4.7 billion in 2008 to $7.1 billion in 2009. Rising feed costs have impacted profit margins in the livestock sector, leading to losses for companies like Tyson Foods. The U.S. livestock sector, facing rising feed costs, reported its first loss in six quarters. Texas Governor Rick Perry highlighted the harmful impact of increasing corn prices on livestock producers. The biofuels industry's demand for feedstock is changing feed supplies, leading to unsettled feed supply logistics and composition. Futures contract prices play a key role in price determination and risk management in wholesale and cash markets. The rapid escalation in agricultural futures prices since 2005 is diminishing the effectiveness of the futures market for price discovery and risk management. Increased margin requirements are putting strain on market participants, and lack of convergence between cash and futures contract prices is increasing risk for grain buyers. This is concerning for traditional commercial interests in the agricultural marketing chain, as their costs may rise with any decline in futures market efficiency. The rise in agricultural futures prices is affecting the efficiency of the futures market and hindering risk management strategies for producers. Concerns arise as grain and oilseed buyers are refraining from offering forward contracts, limiting producers' ability to capitalize on high prices. The lack of convergence between cash and futures prices is a growing issue, with no clear evidence yet on the impact of high commodity prices. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has not found visible evidence of declining hedging operations due to financial obligations. Some blame speculative money for artificially increasing prices in agricultural futures markets. The rise in agricultural futures prices has led to concerns about the efficiency of the futures market and hindered risk management strategies for producers. Speculative participation in futures markets has been blamed for artificially increasing prices and volatility, prompting calls for greater federal regulation and monitoring. Issues such as electronic trading and daily price limits have also been accused of exacerbating the challenges faced by routine hedging operations in agricultural futures markets. The CFTC held a special public \"Round Table\" to address these issues and hear from market participants, although no policy positions were recommended or adopted. The Round Table session addressed concerns about the efficiency of agricultural futures markets and the need for increased monitoring by the CFTC. The rise in demand for commodities is expected to be met through increased supply from domestic or foreign sources, achieved by improving yields or expanding cultivated areas. Market price signals are anticipated to drive farmers to respond by increasing planted area and yield per unit in 2008 through the use of fertilizers, pesticides, improved seeds, and better farming practices. In 2007, 321 million acres were planted to principal crops in the United States, with 315 million acres for major program crops and 62 million acres of hay harvested. Analysts predict that high commodity prices will bring marginal land back into production in 2008, potentially leading to environmental consequences such as water quality degradation and soil erosion. Land-use shifts and cultivation practices may result in winners and losers among crops, as well as reduced wildlife habitat and lower soil fertility. In 2007, 62 million acres of hay were harvested. In 2008, USDA estimates a shift of over 2 million acres from minor crops to program crops, with nearly 1 million acres expected to move from hay to program crop area. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the United States provides payments to farmers to conserve soil and water resources by taking cropland out of production. National enrollment in the CRP was 34.6 million acres in February 2008, with options for renewal or removal based on market conditions. In 2007, USDA announced no penalty-free release of acreage from the CRP. About 130,000 acres were withdrawn early, subject to penalty. Secretary Schafer reiterated this position for FY2008, with a decision for FY2009 pending. In response to high feed prices, USDA allowed over 24 million CRP acres for hay or forage in 2008 after the nesting season. CRP provides environmental benefits like wildlife habitat, erosion control, wetlands protection, and water quality gains. Between September 2007 and February 2008, 2.1 million acres opted out of the CRP as their contracts expired, with another 27.8 million acres set to expire by 2010. High commodity prices may discourage future re-enrollments and contract extensions. Environmental and wildlife organizations advocate for maintaining or expanding CRP levels, while livestock groups and food processors seek to reduce penalties for early contract withdrawals. The Alliance for Agriculture Growth and Competitiveness has been lobbying for penalty-free exits from CRP contracts since 2005. If CRP policy remains unchanged, up to 2 million acres of CRP land per year could be brought back into crop production. USDA's March Prospective Plantings report predicts a 2% increase in program crop planted acreage in 2008 due to high commodity prices. Economists suggest that U.S. farmers' response to high prices is limited by a lack of viable cropland. They propose re-optimizing CRP by eliminating penalties on expiring contracts to bring more productive land back into production. Additionally, they recommend aggressive rebidding of CRP holdings to retain vulnerable land while allowing less vulnerable land to return to production. The rise in agricultural prices and high energy costs have led to higher food inflation globally. This impacts consumers' dietary choices as prices vary across competing food items. Households with lower incomes spend a higher proportion of their budget on food, making them more vulnerable to food price increases. Low income countries, especially those reliant on food imports, face the most significant hardships from rising food prices. In the United States, food prices rose by 4.2% in 2007, the highest increase since 1989. The USDA predicts a 4.5% to 5.5% inflation rate for 2008. The BLS reported a 2.25% increase in food prices in the first four months of 2008, with an annual rate of 6.75%. Energy costs, especially fuel prices, have had a greater impact on food price inflation than commodity prices. Retail food prices are less volatile than farm-level prices due to additional costs like transportation and processing. In the United States, food prices rose by 4.2% in 2007, the highest increase since 1989, with a predicted inflation rate of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2008. Energy costs, particularly fuel prices, have a significant impact on food price inflation. Household income variations can result in challenging spending choices, with lower-income families spending over 20% of their income on food. Food assistance programs like Food Stamps and child nutrition programs help households meet their minimum food needs. In 2007, $33.2 billion was spent on the Food Stamp program, with the average recipient receiving $95.63 per month and the average household receiving $214.69 per month. Rising food prices lead to higher federal spending on food assistance programs, impacting international markets differently based on import dependence and financial ability to respond. Developing countries reliant on imports face greater food security risks due to increased commodity prices. Higher food prices can severely affect lower-income households in foreign markets reliant on food imports. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organization forecasts a $169 billion grain import bill for vulnerable countries in 2008, a 40% increase from 2007. Rising international cereal prices, freight rates, and oil prices contribute to this increase. Despite a slight retreat in ocean freight rates in 2008, the continual rise in crude oil prices suggests shipping costs may not significantly decline. This could have political consequences. The emerging food crisis since January 2008 has led to hoarding, theft, and civil unrest over food prices globally. Higher commodity and food prices are reducing the international community's ability to provide food aid to other countries. The UN's World Food Program estimated it would need $2.9 billion to cover its 2008 approved project needs, but has had to revise its assessment due to continually rising prices. The World Food Program faced challenges with rising prices, leading to increased funding needs of $755 million in April 2008. The United States provided $2.1 billion in food aid in 2006, but rising food and fuel prices resulted in a $200 million shortfall in emergency aid funding in 2008. USAID anticipated a significant reduction in emergency food aid that year. President Bush directed the Secretary of Agriculture to access grain supplies from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust valued at $200 million to meet emergency food aid needs abroad in April 2008. This was in response to pressure from international hunger advocacy groups and the U.S. milling and baking industry to dampen grain prices and augment international supplies. Price increases for some crops were expected to be short-term, with a substantial recovery anticipated by late 2008, especially in wheat and rice markets. FAO forecasts a 3.8% increase in world cereal production to a record 2.192 billion tons in 2008, mainly from wheat. The expanded production is expected to ease global cereal supply tightness, but weather-dependent recovery and volatile commodity prices are still concerns. Repealing export-limiting government policies can lead to immediate price moderation. Ukraine has already lifted its wheat export ban, with expectations for Russia and Kazakhstan to follow suit. Circumstances in the international rice market are also evolving rapidly. Circumstances in the international rice market are rapidly changing. Japan plans to export 200,000 tons of rice to the Philippines, with other countries like China, Thailand, and Cambodia also lifting export bans. India is waiting for the monsoon rains before making any decisions. India is expected to wait for the annual monsoon rains before deciding on easing trade restrictions. Rice export bans may be lifted, leading to lower international rice market prices in 2008. High biofuel feedstock demand has increased prices for competing crops like corn and soybeans. The US and worldwide are projected to see expanded acreage due to high prices, bringing marginal land back into crop production. Expectations for increased double cropping and conversion of pasture land are likely to boost planted area for corn, soybeans, and wheat by nearly 7 million acres in the US. Similar area expansion is expected worldwide due to strong price incentives and government policies. Despite projections for record world grain production in 2008, only marginal global stock building is expected due to strong price incentives and government policies. The EU suspended a set-aside requirement, leading to an increase in crop production. Global production may struggle to meet demand growth, leaving commodity markets vulnerable to news of poor harvests or demand shocks. Continued high price volatility is likely, driven by steady population growth and income growth in developing economies sustaining demand for livestock products and feedstuffs. The outlook for increased demand for agricultural feedstocks to meet government biofuel-usage policies suggests a strong increase in demand for corn and vegetable oils. Prices for feed grains and oilseeds are expected to remain significantly higher than in the past decade. A sustained period of agricultural output growth is needed to return to abundant supplies and moderate prices. Increased production requires more land or higher output per acre. Productivity gains need long-term investment in research and infrastructure. Commodity market evolution depends on policy choices regarding agricultural productivity and renewable energy. The U.S. and global response will vary based on targeted beneficiaries and relevant timeframes. The international response to agricultural challenges varies by beneficiary and time period. Various policy responses are being suggested or implemented by major players in the U.S. and international agricultural arena, including changes in agricultural and food policy advocated by different sectors. The American Bakers Association (ABA) led a march in Washington, D.C. in 2008 to address concerns about grain supplies and price rises, proposing a three-point congressional action plan. The American Bakers Association (ABA) proposed a three-point congressional action plan in 2008 to address concerns about grain supplies and price rises. They recommend decreasing the CRP by 7 million acres, supporting early out-of-contract provisions, identifying viable cropland for production, waiving RFS annual requirements, dropping tariffs on imported ethanol, prioritizing domestic food industry needs over export markets, and freezing biofuels mandates due to their impact on food prices. The U.S. livestock sector has expressed concerns about diverting feed crops to biofuels production. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association opposes national biofuels RFS and supports a market-based approach for ethanol production. The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests a moratorium on global grain- and oilseed-based biofuels to ease corn and wheat prices. Texas Governor Rick Perry requested EPA to waive 50% of ethanol requirements to alleviate corn prices. EPA has the authority to suspend ethanol requirements under Section 211(o) of the Federal Clean Air Act. Governor Perry requested EPA to waive part of the RFS due to rising food costs attributed to ethanol. The National Chicken Council supported Perry's action, while some senators raised concerns about food inflation. However, biofuels advocates argue that high oil prices and global factors are to blame. Congress has held hearings on agricultural price increases since May 1, 2008. Several congressional committees held hearings in May 2008 to address the impact of high food prices on American families, renewable fuels standards, fuel subsidies, global food crisis contributing factors, small businesses, and financial speculation in commodity markets. Multiple bills have been introduced in response to the high commodity prices. Several bills have been introduced in response to high commodity prices, including proposals to repeal biofuels mandates and freeze the Renewable Fuel Standard. Congress is also considering new emergency appropriations bills to address the global food crisis, with President Bush requesting additional funding for food aid. New farm legislation has also been introduced. New farm legislation (P.L. 110-234) was enacted on May 22, 2008, with implications for funding related to domestic and international food concerns. This legislation addresses U.S. domestic nutrition programs, foreign food aid, agricultural incentives, and productivity issues. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced a task force to coordinate efforts in addressing the global food crisis on April 29, 2008. The United Nations agencies responsible for international agricultural development and food aid are the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP). WFP focuses on emergency operations and relief projects, while FAO has a longer-term focus on improving nutrition and agricultural productivity in developing countries. The U.N.'s FAO launched the Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to assist Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries. International agencies are coordinating efforts to address the food-price crisis, with upcoming meetings in Geneva and New York leading up to the FAO's \"Summit on Food Security\" in Rome in June 2008. The Rome summit will coordinate global response to food crises. Current proposals include a U.N. task force, WFP's request for emergency food aid, an initiative to provide seed and fertilizer, and exploring rapid financing for poor countries. The IMF proposes aid for countries with balance of payments gaps, and the U.N. calls for lifting food export restrictions. Interest groups advocate for increased investment in agricultural productivity and eliminating policies that distort market signals. Country-specific policy responses are needed, with suggestions to reverse protective export bans. Recurring themes in addressing high international commodity prices include reversing export bans, reducing subsidies for biofuels, eliminating policies that keep market prices low, and removing barriers to genetically-modified crops. IFPRI recommends short-term social protection programs, ending biofuel subsidies, and eliminating trade barriers to reduce market distortions. IFPRI and the World Bank recommend policy measures to address the global food crisis, including the elimination of trade barriers, long-term investment in agricultural research, and targeted safety net programs. Japanese officials are also taking steps to reduce food-import dependency in response to the crisis. Japanese officials are proposing stronger disciplines on exporting members in the WTO's Doha Round to address the global food crisis. The proposal includes eliminating existing export restrictions within the first year of a new agreement and allowing new restrictions for a maximum of 18 months in consultation with affected importers."
