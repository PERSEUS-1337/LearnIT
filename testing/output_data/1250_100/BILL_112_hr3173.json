    "content": "No relevant information was provided in the curr_chunk for summarization. Congress finds that nearly 2 million transportation workers are required to carry a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Workers must pay $132.50 to obtain the TWIC, which is valid for five years and requires renewal with additional fees and trips to enrollment centers. Workers face the burden of making multiple time-consuming trips to enrollment centers and paying $132.50 for a new TWIC card. The enrollment process is not mandated by statute but is driven by a DHS policy decision to align with Federal standards. DHS may deviate from these standards if deemed necessary for the TWIC program. The TWIC program serves as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce, but possession does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has the flexibility to streamline the enrollment process, unlike other government-issued identity documents like passports. Despite a Congressional mandate, final rules for TWIC biometric readers have not been issued as of August 2010. The sense of Congress is to reform the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should implement TWIC readers promptly for security. Funds for TWIC projects should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. SEC. 3. TWIC APPLICATION REFORM.\n\nWithin 90 days of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of Homeland Security must streamline the TWIC enrollment process to require only one in-person visit, except in special circumstances. Passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
