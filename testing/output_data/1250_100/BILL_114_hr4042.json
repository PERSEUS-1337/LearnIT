    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" Key findings are included in the Act. The \"Pre-K for USA Act\" findings highlight the benefits of high-quality prekindergarten programs, including improved academic success, reduced need for other services, lower likelihood of criminal behavior, and increased college attendance. Despite these advantages, many school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs. In Texas, many school districts offer only part-day prekindergarten programs, missing out on potential Federal funding. State budget cuts in 2011 eliminated grants for expanding half-day to full-day programs. Local governments stepped in to fund full-day prekindergarten programs due to education funding cuts. Direct application for Federal funding would benefit localities. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs.
