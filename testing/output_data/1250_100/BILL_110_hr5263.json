    "content": "The \"Forest Landscape Restoration Act\" aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes to achieve ecological, economic, and social sustainability. It leverages local, national, and private resources to reduce wildfire management costs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Act also highlights the benefits of using forest restoration byproducts to offset treatment costs and improve rural economies. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" The Act establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to select and fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Eligible proposals must have a complete landscape restoration strategy for a 10-year period across at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program selects and funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes on Federal, State, tribal, or private land. The program incorporates the best available science in ecological restoration strategies and requirements for old-growth maintenance and large-tree retention. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes on various types of land. The program involves a collaborative process with diverse stakeholders and successful planning and implementation of restoration projects. Plans include using fire for restoration, improving habitat for wildlife, maintaining water quality, and controlling invasive species. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of a landscape restoration strategy, including the use of woody biomass, annual performance reporting, and the development of small business opportunities in rural communities. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for entities involved in landscape restoration projects, including hiring local people, considering community wildfire protection plans, analyzing cost savings, estimating funding needs, leveraging non-Federal investment, and complying with additional Secretarial requirements. The curr_chunk details the nomination process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals, including submission to the Bureau of Land Management and Regional Forester, nomination by State Directors or Regional Foresters, and documentation requirements for nominated proposals. The curr_chunk outlines the allocation of funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands, ensuring consistency with the landscape restoration strategy. It also requires evidence of funds being used for restoration treatments within the same fiscal year. The restoration proposal for collaborative forest landscape restoration includes activities on non-covered Federal land, with a selection process based on eligibility criteria and special considerations. The Secretaries shall consider the ecological case, collaborative process, cost reduction potential, wildfire management, landscape restoration strength, and non-Federal investment leverage when selecting up to 10 forest landscape restoration proposals annually. The Secretaries will establish advisory panels to evaluate forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological restoration, fire ecology, and wildfire management cost reduction potential. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to cover up to 50% of the cost of ecological restoration treatments on federal lands. This fund will support proposals that aim to reduce costs through the use of woody biomass and small-diameter trees while providing local economic benefits. The Fund will transfer necessary amounts for ecological restoration treatments. The Secretaries will establish an accounting system for the Fund and authorize $40,000,000 for each fiscal year. Implementation work plans and budgets will be created for selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals. The proposal for ecological restoration must include a plan for implementation, a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, sustainability of biomass supply, and local economic benefits, as well as documentation of non-Federal investments in the landscape. Amounts from the Fund will be used for project implementation by the Secretaries. The Secretaries will use funds from the Fund for ecological restoration treatments that align with the landscape restoration proposal and are identified through a collaborative process. An annual report will be prepared on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, including details on treated acres, progress evaluation, community benefits, and multiparty monitoring results. The Secretaries will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years. They will submit a report every 5 years on the program's progress and costs to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Secretaries will report on collaborative forest landscape restoration projects to the Senate's Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Senate's Committee on Appropriations, the House of Representatives' Committee on Natural Resources, and the House of Representatives' Committee on Appropriations."
