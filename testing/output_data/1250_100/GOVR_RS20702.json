Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during the dry season. The Everglades, a network of wetland landscapes, once stretched 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay. The Everglades, a vast wetland landscape, once stretched from Orlando to Florida Bay. Water flowed through creeks and marshes to Lake Okeechobee, eventually reaching Florida Bay. The wetlands acted as natural filters and supported a variety of species. However, human interventions like flood control and reclamation efforts have altered the Everglades' hydrology. The Central and Southern Florida project by the Army Corps of Engineers played a significant role in these changes. The Central and Southern Florida project by the Army Corps of Engineers, authorized in 1948, has significantly altered the Everglades' water regime. Water is now directed into canals and rivers, leading to habitat loss, reduced size, and degraded water quality in the ecosystem. Urban and agricultural development, along with pollutants like excess nutrients and pesticides, have harmed plant and animal populations. The Everglades have been impacted by nutrient pollution, leading to a decline in native vegetation and an increase in invasive species. Restoration efforts by the federal government and the State of Florida, including the Central and Southern Florida project, aim to address these issues. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates restoration activities with a focus on improving water quality, restoring habitats, and ensuring compatibility between natural and built systems, with an estimated cost of nearly $20 billion. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) focuses on capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season. It calls for removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, storage wells, and pumping stations to redistribute water. CERP was approved in WRDA 2000 and authorized $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established that construction, operation, and maintenance costs of CERP projects would be equally shared by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government after years of negotiations. Federal agencies receive appropriations for CERP activities through annual bills, with concerns remaining over project prioritization and federal investment pace. Since WRDA 2000, federal and state funds totaling $2 billion have been allocated for CERP projects, with a focus on accelerating priority projects. Stakeholders are divided on whether this prioritization may shift focus away from ecosystem restoration towards water supply needs. Federal funding pace is also a concern, with some arguing for a faster allocation to meet both water supply and restoration goals. Some stakeholders are concerned about the local rather than national benefits of specific Everglades restoration projects and the increasing costs of CERP projects, particularly related to land acquisition. There is a worry that federal funds committed to CERP may limit funds for other national ecosystem restoration projects. Traditional Corps project sponsors fear that funds may be diverted from their projects to large-scale restoration activities like wetlands restoration in coastal Louisiana. Delays in completing all 15 CERP components by 2007 raise concerns about the plan's feasibility. The interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects, like the Modified Waters Deliveries Project, may impact ecosystem restoration goals. Controversy surrounds potential delays in restoration due to a Florida state law extending phosphorus mitigation deadlines, with critics questioning its impact on restoration efforts. The FY2006 Appropriations Act conditioned funds for restoration on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. Concerns exist about the effectiveness and necessity of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), with some questioning its contribution to Everglades restoration and water quality improvement. Critics note that CERP prioritizes water supply over ecological restoration, leading to revisions in project implementation sequencing. However, these changes have not fully addressed concerns from environmental groups and scientists. Some groups and scientists oppose CERP due to concerns about Florida's financial contribution and the use of funds designated for land acquisition. The National Research Council emphasizes the importance of acquiring land early in the restoration process to prevent irreversible damage. Questions have been raised about the management of Lake Okeechobee, flood management, integration of water management issues, and the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on Everglades restoration efforts. Ecosystem restoration in the Everglades is a young science with evolving technologies and data. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) uses adaptive management to address uncertainties, with pilot projects like aquifer storage and recovery testing new strategies. These projects aim to store water underground for later use during dry periods, but their effectiveness remains uncertain."
