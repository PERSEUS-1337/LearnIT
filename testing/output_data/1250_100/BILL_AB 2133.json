    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to protect both providers and the children in their care from hazards. Family child care providers face risks such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards. It is crucial for them to receive training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. The director is required to publish an annual list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department must protect the personal privacy of small family day care homes by preventing the use of lists containing their names and addresses. The information of small family day care homes is protected to maintain privacy, except for necessary purposes like licensing administration and child placement. Names and addresses may be shared with specific agencies and programs for referrals and assistance. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, shall adopt regulations on the confidentiality of information for small family day care homes. Regulations will ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Family child care provider is defined as a licensed family day care home provider. A family child care provider under a publicly funded child care program must attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession. This training aims to protect the provider's and children's health and safety. The State Department of Social Services requires family child care providers to complete training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It also involves small and large group discussions and learning from child care professionals. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide occupational health and safety training to family child care providers. The entity must have experience in training providers and offer updates on health and safety matters. Providers have opportunities to learn, give feedback, and engage in collective improvement efforts. The State Department of Social Services administers the contract for occupational health and safety training for family child care providers. The curriculum is developed with input from providers and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. Training is coordinated with other requirements to reduce the burden on providers. The State Department of Social Services administers occupational health and safety training for family child care providers. The department provides lists of providers attending training to the training entity for updates on health and safety issues. The training materials must be provided in non-English languages as required by the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act. This section becomes effective on July 1, 2017. The Legislature intends to codify the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints with the State Department of Education for violations of federal or state laws. This section becomes effective on July 1, 2017. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers receiving payment through alternative payment programs to file complaints for non-compliance with laws. The programs include California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program. The enactment of an appropriation is necessary for the operation of this section."
