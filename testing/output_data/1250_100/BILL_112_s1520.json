    "content": "The \"Pan Am Flight 103 Accountability Act of 2011\" is cited as the short title. It calls for an investigation into terrorist attacks against the United States attributed to the government of Muammar Qaddafi. The President is required to continue investigative activities related to terrorist attacks attributed to the government of Muammar Qaddafi, including the bombing of Pan Am flight 103. The President must also urge Libya's government to cooperate in these investigations. The President is restricted from distributing confiscated assets from Muammar Qaddafi until certifying cooperation with investigations related to terrorist attacks. Waivers can be granted for humanitarian purposes. The President must certify to Congress that providing confiscated assets to Libya is in the national security interest of the United States. A report on investigative activities related to terrorist attacks must be submitted to Congress annually. The report required by Congress annually must assess the cooperation of the Transitional National Council or any successor government of Libya in providing information on terrorist attacks by Muammar Qaddafi against US citizens. The report shall be unclassified but may include a classified annex. The reporting requirement will end once the President certifies that all relevant information has been made available. The successor government of Libya has provided all relevant information on terrorist attacks by Muammar Qaddafi against US citizens, including the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103."
