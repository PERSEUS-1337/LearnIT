The agent computes painting strokes based on a reference image, ensuring predictability and controllability through constrained learning. Results show the agent can handle various painting media and constraints to collaborate with humans or other agents. Throughout history, painting has been a crucial aspect of artistic creation, spanning various styles like watercolor, oil painting, and sketching. Advances in image processing and computer graphics have led to the development of non-photorealistic rendering techniques. Recent progress in machine learning has significantly improved computer vision and graphics, including the creation of computer-based painting systems. Generative methods based on generative adversarial networks have shown promising results in stroke-based rendering tasks. In this paper, the focus is on training a natural media painting agent for interactive applications without supervision. The approach involves developing a stroke-based rendering technique using deep CNN in a model-based environment. The agent is trained using model-based reinforcement learning to manipulate various painting media like charcoal, pencil, and watercolor. Constraints are introduced to enable control for interactive applications, resulting in a constrained painting agent. The constrained painting agent allows interaction with humans or other agents to generate various styles without retraining. It includes methods for training agents with constraints on actions, rolling out agents for new stylistic effects, and generating high-resolution images with different paintbrush configurations. The algorithm is evaluated on various datasets and paintbrush settings to showcase its advantages over previous methods. The curr_chunk discusses stroke-based rendering methods for generating artistic effects using heuristics-based and machine learning approaches. It highlights the challenges of extending hand-engineered features to different painting styles and the benefits of using machine learning techniques to learn painting policies. The curr_chunk discusses various machine learning approaches for generating paintings, including using RNNs to learn latent spaces, deep reinforcement learning, and proximal policy optimization with curriculum learning. These methods aim to learn painting policies without relying on hand-engineered features or expert demonstrations. Train a differentiable painting environment model using model-based RL with DDPG. The approach involves training a painting agent with neural networks and encoding constraints using reinforcement learning. The text chunk discusses training a painting agent using a natural media environment model and a neural renderer. The agent predicts actions for the renderer to execute and updates the canvas accordingly. Unlike previous approaches, a natural media painting renderer is used for generating the canvas. In 2019, a natural media painting renderer MyPaint was used for an experiment, providing rich visual effects and blending functions. The painting agent's actions involve configurations for interacting with the environment using quadratic Bezier curves. Each stroke consists of a 3-point curve with pressure affecting blending and stroke width. The agent uses one color for each stroke and adjusts transparency based on pressure. The stroke in painting can be affected by pressure. The action is represented in a continuous space for precise control. The observation includes the reference image, current canvas, and constraint. The reward measures the effectiveness of the action. The goal is to reproduce the reference image. The loss function is defined between the current canvas and the reference image. The loss function L is calculated between the current canvas at step t and the reference image. L is defined as l2 or WGAN. The reward rt is the difference of losses between two continuous steps, normalized to rt \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 1]. The objective is to maximize discounted accumulative rewards qt = \u2211tmax t=1 rt \u03b3t. The transition function is represented by the rendering function R, where the action modifies the current painting state. The real environment renderer Rr is modeled using a neural network Rn with different paintbrush configurations. Modeling the environment in reinforcement learning offers benefits such as saving training time by simplifying the environment model and making the framework differentiable. The transition function is represented by the renderer network Rn, which is used for training, while the real environment Rr is used for the roll-out process. The process involves building a dataset of paired data and synthesizing stroke images on a blank canvas to predict actions. Different paintbrush configurations are treated as separate models in this approach. The text discusses training a natural media painting agent in the real environment Rr for the roll-out process. The agent is made controllable for interactive scenarios and generating stylized images by constraining it with a modified action space. The proposed constrained painting agent can follow any constraint drawn from the subspace of action space A, eliminating the need for retraining for different constraints within the same subspace. The constraint representation, training, and roll-out schemes of the constrained agent are introduced in the section. The text discusses training a natural media painting agent in the real environment Rr for the roll-out process. The agent is made controllable for interactive scenarios and generating stylized images by constraining it with a modified action space. The proposed constrained painting agent can follow any constraint drawn from the subspace of action space A. Constraints can be defined for stroke color, start position, and stroke width. The constrained agent takes additional constraints as observations, encoded as a bitmap to feed into the policy and value networks. The text discusses training a natural media painting agent in the real environment Rr for interactive scenarios by constraining it with a modified action space. The policy network decodes the constraint into actions, and a training scheme is proposed using an unconstrained agent to generate constraints. The constrained agent takes additional constraints as observations to create stylized images. The constrained agent is trained by cascading an unconstrained agent, extracting constraints from the action space, and using a renderer for visual quality. Constraints are extracted from human commands or a painting agent's output for each step in the training process. The painting agent's output is split into two agents exploring separate action spaces A0 and A1. Different paintbrushes are treated as different models in the natural media painting environment. Various datasets are used to train the unconstrained painting agent, with different numbers of strokes required for reproduction. The l2 loss between reference and reproduced images is measured throughout the training process. The painting agent's output is split into two agents exploring separate action spaces A0 and A1.

The l2 loss between reference and reproduced images is measured throughout the training process. The training process involves using MNIST, KanjiVG, CelebA, and ImageNet as reference images, employing a coarse-to-fine strategy for roll-out, and training constrained painting agents with different constraint configurations using the same neural environment and dataset. The painting agents use constraints like color palette and stroke width to generate artistic paintings. They employ a coarse-to-fine strategy for roll-out, dividing the reference images into patches. The trained agents collaborate with humans and other agents to create different visual effects using natural media. The text discusses the use of deep CNN to train a natural media painting agent with constraint representation for interactive painting. The algorithm can reproduce reference images in various artistic styles and aims to extend to different paintbrush configurations. Roll-out results show the agents trained with various brushes in MyPaint using a coarse-to-fine strategy for higher resolutions. The text describes the use of a coarse-to-fine strategy in reproducing Van Gogh's Starry Night using charcoal and watercolor brushes in MyPaint. The reference image and canvas are divided into patches for the painting agent trained with different brushes."
