    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given flexibility by states to set emission ceilings, while new sources had to adhere to strict technology-based standards set by the EPA. The 1977 amendments further strengthened regulations in areas where air quality exceeded national standards. The Clean Air Act of 1970 differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. The 1977 amendments required \"major\" new sources in areas exceeding national air quality standards to undergo New Source Review (NSR) before construction. NSR mandates obtaining permits with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. NSR applies to both new construction and modifications of existing sources in Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and nonattainment areas. The Clean Air Act of 1970 required \"major\" new sources in areas exceeding national air quality standards to undergo New Source Review (NSR) before construction. The definition of \"modification\" for determining applicability of NSR is crucial, as it involves any physical change that increases air pollutant emissions. Litigation has focused on the interpretation of phrases like \"physical change\" and \"change in the method of operation.\" The Clean Air Act of 1970 required \"major\" new sources in areas exceeding national air quality standards to undergo New Source Review (NSR) before construction. Litigation has focused on the interpretation of phrases like \"physical change\" and \"change in the method of operation.\" A mere modification triggers NSPSs and NSR, while a reconstruction of an existing facility also does so. EPA defines a \"reconstruction\" as the replacement of components exceeding 50 percent of the fixed capital cost of a new facility. Modifications can trigger heightened pollution-control requirements, but EPA has exceptions for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement. The EPA regulations previously did not specify activities included as routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR) for a source category. Eligibility for the RMRR exemption was determined through case-by-case analysis. In the case of Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly (WEPCO), the court ruled that EPA's case-by-case approach in determining RMRR was proper, dismissing WEPCO's argument. EPA required a permit for WEPCO's proposed renovations, which included repair and replacement of various components. The EPA's case-by-case approach in determining RMRR was deemed appropriate by the court due to the substantial and unprecedented nature of the plant work. Recent focus on the RMRR exemption was sparked by CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities for exceeding routine maintenance. President Bush's National Energy Policy directed EPA to review NSR impact, leading to a report in June 2002 advocating for specifying routine maintenance activities. On December 31, 2002, EPA published final regulations affecting how sources calculate emission increases for NSR purposes. A proposed rule clarified the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories without other considerations. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman involved the TVA violating the CAA with rehabilitation projects beyond RMRR. The court found the CAA unconstitutional in part regarding civil penalties. The CAA was found unconstitutional in part for imposing severe penalties without proof in court. The RMRR exception was reshaped in October 2003 with a new equipment-replacement rule for regulatory certainty and environmental protection. The new rule specifies that the replacement of components of a process unit with identical components or their functional equivalents constitutes RMRR, provided the replacement cost is less than 20% of the current replacement value of the unit, and certain conditions are met to ensure compliance with emission limitations. This new approach allows for more replacements compared to the previous case-by-case method, which was a source of controversy. The new rule imposes higher thresholds for RMRR, making the case-by-case approach uncommon. It does not require recordkeeping, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. Lawsuits argue that the rule exceeds EPA's authority under the CAA, with a stay granted pending further review. The court granted a stay on the new rule, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits. The old case-by-case approach continues to apply as the new rule is suspended. The court declined to consolidate cases but designated the same panel for related equipment-replacement rule cases."
