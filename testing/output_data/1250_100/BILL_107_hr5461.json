Congress finds that responders to the 9/11 attacks required coordination and support from various levels of government and agencies to ensure effective emergency response and minimize loss of life and property damage. Regional councils and planning entities are crucial for coordinating comprehensive regional plans involving Federal, State, and local needs. The purpose of this Act is to encourage and facilitate the development and implementation of regional emergency preparedness and coordination plans among Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector within the region to ensure effective regional preparedness and mitigation efforts. Regional councils of government play a crucial role in coordinating emergency plans involving all stakeholders. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"region\" refers to a designated planning area, \"regional council\" is a multipurpose association of governments, \"local government\" includes cities, counties, and townships, \"State\" encompasses all 50 states and territories, and \"stakeholder\" includes various entities like elected officials, emergency management agencies, and health professionals. The term \"regional plan\" refers to a regional emergency preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery plan involving various stakeholders such as college and university representatives, the business community, port and airport officials, utilities, State departments of transportation, and other identified entities. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO COORDINATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS, COORDINATION, AND RECOVERY PLANS. The regional councils defined in section 3(2) must convene all stakeholders in the region to coordinate emergency preparedness plans. The regional plan should include assessments of potential targets, available resources, equipment needs, a communication system, and a secure information repository. The regional plan should include the locations, contacts, and capabilities of emergency medical facilities, fire, police, and emergency medical technician services, appropriate medical facilities and personnel, area stakeholders, key military personnel and facilities, existing shelters, and facilities at schools, colleges, universities, and churches. The infrastructure section of the regional plan includes the locations of water treatment and storage facilities, utilities lines, sewer mains, communication facilities, bridges, dams, and educational facilities. The regional plan includes details on transportation facilities, at-risk populations, and potential targets such as hazardous chemical concentrations. This complements the information on infrastructure like water treatment facilities and educational facilities. The planning activities include identifying hazardous chemicals, fuel depots, munitions concentrations, and potential targets like nuclear power plants. Debris disposal locations and health hazards for personnel are also considered. Planning involves analyzing disaster possibilities and utilizing Geographic Information Systems to assess hazards and consequences. The regional plan for emergencies and disasters must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and Governor within 12 months of receiving a planning grant. The plan should be updated annually based on threat assessments, trainings, and drills. Information in the plan is only accessible to relevant officials, and technology must be used to secure key resources and critical infrastructure. Coordination with various government agencies is necessary to protect resources within each region. It is necessary to review and make recommendations for improving policies and procedures governing the security of information shared with law enforcement, intelligence, and other entities related to homeland security within the region, including government personnel, agencies, authorities, and the private sector. SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n(a) An amount of not less than three percent of funds for emergency preparedness and homeland security shall be allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for regional plans.\n(b) Allocations to regions will be based on population, necessary base amounts, vulnerability to catastrophic events, and presence of significant facilities.\n(c) Federal funding for local, regional, or State projects must align with regional plans for emergency preparedness, response, recovery, or mitigation."
