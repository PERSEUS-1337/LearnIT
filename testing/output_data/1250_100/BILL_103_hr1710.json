    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Negotiated Rate Amendments of 1993\" and outlines the procedure for resolving disputes. For purposes of section 10701 of title 49, it is unreasonable for a carrier or freight forwarder to charge the difference between a filed tariff rate and a negotiated rate if they are no longer transporting property between specific places to avoid this rule. The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to determine if such charges are being attempted or made. The Commission considers various factors when determining if charging a person a transportation rate different from the filed tariff is unreasonable, including offers made, reliance on the rate, proper filing of tariffs, billing and collection, and demands for additional payment. When challenging freight rates, no additional compensation is required until the Commission determines the reasonableness. Subsection (a) is an exception to filed tariff requirements for transportation services. Definitions for Commission, household goods, and freight forwarder are provided. The terms \"Commission\", \"household goods\", \"household goods freight forwarder\", \"nonhousehold goods freight forwarder\", \"nonhousehold goods motor carrier\", and \"negotiated rate\" are defined under section 10102 of title 49, United States Code. A negotiated rate is an agreement between a nonhousehold goods motor carrier or nonhousehold goods freight forwarder and a shipper without a filed tariff. SEC. 3. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. Motor Carrier Charges and Overcharges under Section 11706 of title 49, United States Code, have specific time limits for initiating civil actions to recover charges or address overcharges. The carrier must begin a civil action within 24 months after the claim accrues for transportation or service provided within certain timeframes. The civil action time limits for recovering overcharges from carriers under Section 11706 of title 49, United States Code, have been amended. The carrier must now initiate a civil action within 24 months after the claim accrues for transportation or service provided within specific timeframes. Additionally, a conforming amendment has been made to Section 11706(d) by replacing \"3-year period\" with \"limitations period\". SEC. 4. TARIFF RECONCILIATION RULES FOR MOTOR CARRIERS OF PROPERTY. Chapter 117 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section regarding tariff reconciliation rules for motor common carriers of property. Motor carriers and shippers can resolve overcharge and undercharge claims by mutual consent, subject to Commission review. This does not exempt carriers from filing and adhering to rates, rules, and classifications as required by law. The Commission will establish rules within 90 days to exempt tariff requirements for certain circumstances. SEC. 5. CUSTOMER ACCOUNT CODES.\n\nSection 10762 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to allow the use of numerical or alpha account codes in tariffs. The customer's name must be included for each account code for transportation performed after the 90th day following the enactment of this subsection.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThe Act, including amendments, will take effect on the enactment date, with exceptions for proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission or court actions pending or commenced after the enactment date."
