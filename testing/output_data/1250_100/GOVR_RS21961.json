    "content": "Ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid fuel for rockets and missiles, with uncertainty surrounding its health effects slowing efforts to establish cleanup standards. Perchlorate has been detected in water in at least 33 states, leading to states setting their own standards ranging from 1-51 parts per billion. Concern has escalated due to perchlorate's persistence in water and its impact on thyroid function, especially near military and manufacturing facilities. Perchlorate contamination has been found in various sources such as rocket fuel manufacturing facilities, military bases, and organic fertilizer. It has been detected in drinking water primarily in the Southwest and scattered locations across the country, with groundwater being the most affected. In 1999, EPA required public water systems to monitor perchlorate levels, with 4.1% of systems testing positive in 26 states and two commonwealths, including California. Perchlorate contamination has been found in various sources like rocket fuel manufacturing facilities, military bases, and organic fertilizer. In 26 states and two commonwealths, 14 systems in California exceeded EPA's remediation goal for perchlorate levels. Approximately 1.9% of samples collected had perchlorate detections at 4 \u00b5g/L or greater. California has conducted more comprehensive monitoring, detecting perchlorate in 241 sources of drinking water since 2002. EPA reported perchlorate contamination at DOD facilities, federal facilities, and private sites. The Government Accountability Office found perchlorate at 395 sites. FDA tested 500 food samples for perchlorate in 2004. The FDA found perchlorate in 90% of lettuce samples and 101 of 104 bottled milk samples. Perchlorate was detected in 50% of samples in the Total Diet Study, with higher levels in some foods like shrimp, tomatoes, spinach, and bacon. Children aged 2 years had the highest perchlorate intake per kilogram body weight per day. Perchlorate disrupts iodine uptake in the thyroid but is not known to cause cancer. EPA considers non-water exposures when setting standards for contaminants. Perchlorate exposure disrupts iodine uptake in the thyroid, leading to health effects similar to iodine deficiency. Pregnant women are particularly at risk, as thyroid function impairment can impact fetal development and learning capacity. Studies show that even low levels of perchlorate can affect thyroid hormone levels in women with iodine deficiency. EPA has been evaluating the need for a federal drinking water standard for perchlorate over the past decade. In 1997, EPA began evaluating whether perchlorate should be regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. By 2007, EPA had collected enough data to determine the frequency and levels of perchlorate in public water supplies nationwide. In 2007, EPA reported sufficient occurrence data for perchlorate and stated that further monitoring was unnecessary for regulatory determination. EPA issued draft reference doses for perchlorate exposure in 1992 and 1995, with a range of 0.0001 to 0.0005 mg/kg body weight per day. The agency considers factors like sensitive subpopulations, study duration, and data gaps when setting a drinking water standard. EPA's 1999 draft risk characterization resulted in a human risk benchmark of 0.0009 mg/kg per day, equivalent to a drinking water level of 32 ppb. In 2002, EPA prepared a draft risk assessment for perchlorate, concluding potential health risks including effects on the nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies. The draft RfD was controversial due to cleanup costs and scientific concerns. Commentors raised concerns about the draft RfD for perchlorate, fearing costly cleanups at federal facilities and in water supplies. A federal interagency working group, including DOD, EPA, and other agencies, asked the National Research Council to review the science and EPA's draft assessment. The NRC recommended changes due to differences between rats and humans in assessing health risks from perchlorate ingestion. The National Research Council (NRC) reviewed studies on rats and humans regarding perchlorate exposure. They found that thyroid tumors in rats were likely treatment-related, but unlikely in humans due to different mechanisms to compensate for thyroid disorders. The NRC criticized flaws in rat studies and disagreed with EPA's risk assessment model, stating it did not accurately represent possible outcomes after changes in thyroid hormone production. They defined transient changes in serum thyroid hormone as biochemical events preceding adverse effects. The NRC recommended using the inhibition of iodide uptake by the thyroid in humans as the basis for risk assessment of perchlorate, leading to an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect fetuses of pregnant women. This recommendation was supported by various studies on perchlorate exposure. The NRC recommended an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day for perchlorate based on studies on exposure. EPA adopted a DWEL of 24.5 ppb in 2005, with plans to lower it for other sources of exposure. EPA's Superfund office issued guidance in 2006 adopting the NRC's recommendations for perchlorate assessment and cleanup. The EPA's Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee (CHPAC) raised concerns about the preliminary remediation goal (PRG) for perchlorate at Superfund sites, stating that it did not adequately protect infants who are highly susceptible to neurodevelopmental toxicity. They recommended lowering the PRG and issuing a drinking water health advisory to address early life exposures. In 2008, EPA announced a preliminary decision not to regulate perchlorate due to low occurrence levels above the health reference level. The EPA's Science Advisory Board's Drinking Water Committee argued that EPA must have a compelling basis to support a determination not to regulate perchlorate due to its toxicity. EPA announced seeking advice from the NRC before setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate, replacing the preliminary remediation goal with an interim health advisory of 15 ppb based on NRC's recommendation to protect the most sensitive population. The EPA sought advice from the NRC regarding perchlorate regulation, focusing on the most sensitive population - fetuses of pregnant women. However, concerns were raised about the exposure of nursing infants. EPA decided not to further review perchlorate issues with the NRC to avoid delays in regulatory decisions. Instead, they requested public comments on alternative data analysis methods. The EPA is seeking public comment on analyzing data for the regulatory determination of perchlorate. They are considering a broader range of alternatives for interpreting health concern levels, occurrence in drinking water, and potential risk reduction. The focus is now on sensitive life stages, including infants and developing children. The final decision may lead to regulation, with the Department of Defense allocating significant resources for research, treatment technologies, and cleanup efforts. Funds have been spent on cleanup efforts driven by drinking water standards. In 2006, EPA established a DWEL for perchlorate, prompting DOD to set 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing releases. DOD's policy requires testing for perchlorate and conducting risk assessments for levels exceeding 24 ppb. A relative risk site evaluation framework is used to prioritize restoration work and allocate resources. EPA has withdrawn the 2006 perchlorate remediation guidance. EPA has withdrawn the 2006 perchlorate remediation guidance and recommends using the interim health advisory level of 15 ppb for cleanup. Legislation has been introduced in Congress regarding perchlorate regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Funding has been provided for perchlorate contamination remediation, including $1.6 million for cleanup of drinking water wells and $3.5 million for Inland Empire perchlorate remediation. The bills H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252, known as the Inland Empire Perchlorate Ground Water Plume Assessment Act of 2009, aim to study water resources in California, specifically the Rialto-Colton Basin. H.R. 4252 was passed by the House in March 2010 and ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in July. Additionally, H.R. 102 would authorize more funding for the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund with a 35% non-federal matching requirement for water districts. During the 110th Congress, several perchlorate bills were considered but not enacted in response to the EPA's decision not to require further monitoring for perchlorate. S. 24 was introduced to require community water systems to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer reports. S. 150 and H.R. 1747 aimed to set a standard for perchlorate. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported on S. 24 and S. 150. H.Con.Res. 347 urged the CDC and FDA to educate the public on the importance of adequate iodine intake to protect against perchlorate exposure."
