    "content": "The report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and lists CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The reports do not cover mandatory funding or other legislation related to DHS programs. The Appendix explains specialized budgetary concepts. The curr_chunk provides an explanation of specialized budgetary concepts related to appropriations, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to spending caps. It also mentions that all amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority and that data for FY2019 appropriations is derived from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. The curr_chunk explains the sources of FY2019 supplemental appropriations data and FY2020 requested, recommended, and enacted levels of annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. It includes information from various enacted measures and committee reports. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the legislative process for appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2020, starting from the Administration's budget request to the enactment of annual appropriations. The data used in the report is consistent and developed with Congressional Budget Office methodology, without comparing it to Office of Management and Budget data due to technical scoring differences. The Trump Administration requested $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2020, a $2.27 billion increase from the previous year. Additionally, $14.08 billion was requested for FEMA in disaster relief funding, and $190 million for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, including $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.12 billion above the Administration's request. The bill also included $14.08 billion in disaster relief funding and OCO funding to be transferred to the Coast Guard. Amendments adopted in full committee markup led to a CBO scoring exceeding the subcommittee allocation by $3 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, their version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020. The bill included $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the Administration's request. It also included $5 billion for border barrier construction, an increase from the previous year. Both the House and Senate committees allocated more funding for various agencies than requested by the Administration. Additionally, the Senate committee bill included $17.35 billion in disaster relief funding and $190 million in OCO-designated funding for the Coast Guard. Congress passed a continuing resolution on September 27, 2019, to temporarily extend funding at the FY2019 rate. The continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. 116-59) extended funding at the FY2019 rate for operations through November 21, later extended through December 20. It included provisions for Secret Service expenses, Disaster Relief Fund, National Flood Insurance Program, and DHS management activities restructuring. Immigration provisions linked to appropriations cycle were also extended. Two consolidated appropriations bills were released on December 16, 2019. The House passed an appropriations bill using H.R. 1158 as a legislative shell, which included funding for DHS and FEMA. The bill was signed into law on December 20, 2019, as P.L. 116-93. The annual funding for DHS operations is mostly from appropriations, with the rest coming from fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. DHS appropriations are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction. Congress and the Administration initially used existing account structures for funding after DHS was established in 2003. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure to standardize appropriations format across components. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented a new budget request system in FY2017, known as the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS). This system converted legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. These categories cover various expenses and funding needs for DHS components. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) in FY2017, which includes four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. Some appropriations, such as the Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay, have unique funding mechanisms with net-zero impact on total discretionary spending. The Retired Pay appropriation does not count against discretionary allocation in the bill. FEMA receives separate appropriations for disaster relief activities, allowing for better tracking of spending. The National Flood Insurance Program has mandatory spending but some functions are funded through discretionary appropriations. The FY2017 act grouped provisions within appropriations and general provisions as \"administrative provisions\" at the ends of titles where components are funded. This report tracks changes in administrative and general provisions compared to the prior year's measure, noting dropped, added, and modified provisions. Changes may occur due to time passage, permanent legislation, or relevance. The report discusses appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, categorizing its components into Law Enforcement Operational, Incident Response and Recovery Operational, Support, and Headquarters Components. Each group and component's role is briefly described. The Department of Homeland Security's components are categorized into Law Enforcement Operational, Incident Response and Recovery Operational, Support, and Headquarters Components. Each group's role is briefly described, along with their FY2019 enacted and FY2020 appropriations. Funding for law enforcement operational components is generally provided in Title II of the annual DHS appropriations act, with key components including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. The U.S. Secret Service protects the President, Vice-President, and investigates financial crimes. Budgetary resources for these components are controlled through appropriations legislation. H.R. 3931 had 31 administrative provisions, dropping eight from the previous year. The FY2019 act dropped eight provisions, including ICE reprogramming funding for alien detention, TSA monitoring airport exit lanes, USCG reallocating OCO funding, TSA pilot program for screening services, USCG maintaining Operations Systems Center, prohibiting competitions to privatize USCG activities, altering USCG Civil Engineering program activities, and requiring DHS collaboration on border barriers. Three administrative provisions were modified, and seven new provisions were added in S. 2582. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, includes 36 administrative provisions in Title II. Sections 225 and 232 from the FY2019 act were dropped, four provisions were modified, and six new administrative provisions were included. Funding for operational components focused on incident response and recovery is generally found in Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act, including funding for FEMA and the newly restructured Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The reorganization shifted the Federal Protective Service from CISA to the Management Directorate, reducing budgetary resources. CISA, formerly NPPD, promotes information sharing for cybersecurity and infrastructure security. FEMA leads efforts to protect the US from natural disasters and terrorism. Budget breakdown for these components is detailed in Table 4. The House Appropriations Committee's H.R. 3931 included eight administrative provisions in Title III, with changes from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee's S. 2582 had six administrative provisions in Title III, with some provisions dropped. Governors can now resubmit requests for FEMA's reconsideration of Stafford Act individual assistance for certain disasters. The Senate Appropriations Committee dropped three administrative provisions from Title III in P.L. 116-93, Div. D, including waivers for SAFER Act grants. No new provisions were added, and some provisions were modified. Funding for support components is typically in Title IV of the annual DHS appropriations bill, with changes appearing more significant when expressed as a percentage. USCIS administers U.S. immigration laws, while FLETC provides technical training for law enforcement professionals. The curr_chunk discusses the budgetary resources provided to various components of DHS, including the Science and Technology Directorate, Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, and administrative provisions in H.R. 3931. It also mentions changes made to the appropriations bill, such as dropping certain provisions related to USCIS and the National Bio- and Agrodefense Facility. The budgetary resources provided to various components of DHS, including the Science and Technology Directorate and Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, were discussed in the curr_chunk. H.R. 3931 included two new provisions, while S. 2582 had nine administrative provisions in Title IV. Changes were made to the appropriations bill, dropping certain provisions related to USCIS and the National Bio- and Agrodefense Facility. The Departmental Management Directorate (DM) provides DHS-wide mission support services. Analysis and Operations (A&O) includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination (OPS). The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that reports on DHS efficiency and effectiveness. Table 8 breaks down the budgetary resources for these components controlled through appropriations legislation. The table shows the funding for DHS headquarters components in H.R. 3931 (Title I) and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 2582. The House bill had five administrative provisions, with one new provision for an Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The Senate bill had six provisions, all retained without changes. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included seven provisions, with no dropped provisions. The House Appropriations Committee bill included the creation of an Immigration Detention Ombudsman with minor modifications. The bill contained 36 general provisions, with four new additions and four modified versions from the previous year. Six provisions from the FY2019 act were not included in the House committee version of H.R. 3931. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 2582, included provisions such as funding for financial systems modernization activities, reductions in administrative spending, and restrictions on implementing the Arms Trade Treaty. It had 36 general provisions in Title V, with some modifications from the previous year's act. Some provisions from the FY2019 act were dropped or modified in the Senate committee's bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 2582, included funding for DHS financial systems modernization, grants for local law enforcement costs for Presidential protection, and prohibitions on using funds for a Principal Federal Official during a declared disaster. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included 40 general provisions in Title V, with rescissions of various types. Some provisions directly impacted funding in the bill. In FY2019, funding provisions in the bill included Financial Systems Modernization and Presidential Residence Protection Cost grants. Financial Systems Modernization is managed by DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer, while Presidential Residence Protection Cost grants are managed by FEMA. H.R. 3931 funded the grants but not the modernization. S. 2582 did not include additional appropriations. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, allocated $41 million for the grants. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations were also included in the bill. The Administration proposed rescinding $250 million in prior-year funding from the DRF not dedicated to major disasters. H.R. 3931 included $657 million in rescissions from other appropriations, with the largest coming from CBP's PC&I appropriation for FY2019. S. 2582 included $62 million in provisions to reduce the bill's score, including a $33 million reduction in DHS administrative costs. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included $754 million in rescissions, including $300 million from unobligated balances in the DRF and $233 million in emergency-designated rescissions from CBP appropriations. The federal government spending process involves budget authority enacted by Congress, funds obligated by federal agencies, and payments made to liquidate those obligations. Budget authority determines the amounts available for agencies to spend and must not exceed the amount enacted by Congress. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized. Budget authority enacted by Congress specifies the amount available for spending by federal agencies. It can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Obligations are incurred when agencies enter into contracts or employ personnel, creating a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Budget authority can be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory spending provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes both discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated annually by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government through business-type transactions, which are not considered federal revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is the total funds appropriated by Congress each year, composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset it. Some collections offset agency discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending, such as entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. The DHS budget also contains Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, not appropriated by Congress. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process, with 302(a) allocations setting overall spending totals. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These amounts, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year by the appropriations committee. Table A-1 shows the 302(b) allocation for FY2020. Amendments were made in the House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill. The House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded its discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending, with adjustments allowed for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud control. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments for various types of spending in the DHS appropriations process. One of these adjustments is for disaster relief, which was determined by OMB using a formula until FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula to increase the allowable adjustment size. In August 2019, OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2020 to be $17.5 billion. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments for various types of spending in the DHS appropriations process, including disaster relief. OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2020 to be $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. This estimate is based on the 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final allowable adjustment for FY2020 may still differ from this estimate."
