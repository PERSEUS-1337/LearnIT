    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act highlights key points. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for creators and promotes society's interest in the free flow of ideas and information. The copyright term is limited to ensure the public is not permanently deprived of the benefits of an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on copyright protection. Both commercial and noncommercial creators benefit from a healthy public domain. Book publishers print public domain titles at reduced prices, while others use it as raw material for new productions. Schools, museums, and libraries utilize public domain works for educational and cultural purposes. Media sources like the World Wide Web also benefit from public domain content. Current law grants copyright protection to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. The existing copyright system prevents abandoned works from entering the public domain for many years, hindering the ability of entities to build upon and preserve them. This goes against the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution and Congress in enacting the Copyright Act. It is necessary to establish a mechanism to address abandoned American copyrights. Establish a mechanism for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS.
