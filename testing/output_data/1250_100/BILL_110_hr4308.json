Restrictions include no logos on spacecraft, astronaut endorsements, agency-wide endorsements, or in-kind contributions. The Administrator establishes restrictions on contributions, including no in-kind contributions, minimum contribution levels, and other inappropriate features. Procedures are in place to protect proprietary information, and NASA is encouraged to participate in promotional programs. Enforcement measures are in place for unauthorized use of the Partnership Logo. The Administrator enforces restrictions on contributions and unauthorized use of the Partnership Logo through civil actions, including injunctions and civil penalties of $100,000 per violation. Additionally, the Administrator may report to Congress annually on these enforcement actions. The Administrator must report to Congress annually on all actions taken by NASA, including receipts, expenditures, and evaluation of the Innovation Fund Sponsorship Program. The Advisory Committee must also report on its actions. The Committee consults with directors of NASA Centers to improve the program. NASA's Langley Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Stennis Space Center are key facilities that play a crucial role in the agency's operations. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 is amended to include the NASA Innovation Fund and Sponsorship Act of 2007.
