    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during hydraulic fracturing, citing reports from the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency have reported a lack of evidence showing that hydraulic fracturing poses a risk to groundwater. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management Director stated in 2011 that there have been no verified cases of groundwater contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. In 2011, Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey stated no adverse effects from fracking chemicals. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are federally regulated under environmental statutes. Congress has chosen not to include fracking in the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new federal regulations on fracking on federal land. The Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. The Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange reported that states have improved groundwater protection laws for oil and gas production. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND. The term \"Federal land\" includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. SEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on state land. Federal land follows the laws of the state where it is located for the same activities."
