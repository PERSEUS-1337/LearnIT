    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. The Administration made multiple requests throughout 2007, with Congress expected to consider the remaining requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In fall 2007, Congress focused on FY2008 supplemental appropriations for military operations. The Army and Marine Corps faced funding shortages due to high operational pace in Iraq. Without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. Options included transferring funds, slowing peacetime operations, or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" The $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for military operations was approved by Congress to temporarily resolve funding shortages for the Army and Marine Corps in FY2008. The funding provided in the appropriations act, P.L. 110-161, along with the regular defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, is estimated to last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance. The Defense Department has options to extend operations further by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or using standing authorities like the Feed and Forage Act. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies for FY2008. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at about the same pace as in 2006, acknowledging it was a rough projection. The budget did not reflect the proposed surge in troops to Iraq. The White House requested additional funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2008, including $5.3 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and $45.9 billion for various activities related to ongoing conflicts. The total emergency supplemental appropriations requested for FY2008 were $195.6 billion, with a focus on military operations and foreign affairs programs. Congressional debate in early 2007 centered on supplemental appropriations for FY2007 before shifting to FY2008 funding. In early 2007, the focus was on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with the President vetoing an initial bill due to Iraq policy provisions. A compromise bill, H.R. 2206, was approved by Congress, providing funding for defense, international affairs, and domestic programs. Congressional action on FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September and was finalized shortly before Christmas, including funds for MRAP vehicles and partial year funding debates. In September 2007, Congress approved $5.2 billion for MRAP vehicles in the FY2008 continuing resolution. In November 2007, $460 billion was allocated for Defense Department activities, including $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was provided for MRAP vehicles, but no extra funding was included for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. On November 14, 2007, the House approved a bill providing $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The bill required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and limited the mission of remaining forces. The Senate later rejected the bill. The Senate rejected a motion to provide $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of limited operations without additional funding, leading to furloughs and operational constraints. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to extend Army operations until February 23. The House approved an appropriations bill providing $485 billion in regular and emergency funding for various programs, excluding defense. An additional $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations was allocated for Operation Enduring Freedom. Army and Marine Corps operations were only funded until February 23. On December 18, 2007, the Senate approved $70 billion in emergency funding for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without restrictions on where the money could be used. This resolved a funding dispute and prevented the shutdown of Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. The President signed the consolidated appropriations bill into law on December 26, 2007. The Defense Department warned of running out of money for Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. Secretary of Defense Gates mentioned a potential shutdown of Army bases by mid-February, leading to furloughs. Emergency funding of $70 billion averted the shutdown until at least June 2008, providing $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations. This funding, combined with regular appropriations, sustains Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August. The Army will exhaust its military personnel account funds by mid-June, before running out of operation and maintenance money. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for transfers between accounts to extend operations, potentially allowing for another month of Army operations without slowing down. The Defense Department could extend Army operations for another month by invoking the Feed and Forage Act or using other authority to allocate financing. Congress's agreement to provide a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate over funding. Without supplemental appropriations, the Army's funds would be exhausted by mid-June, and the proposed transfer of $4.1 billion could extend operations for another two to three weeks. The Defense Department could extend Army operations for another two to three weeks with a proposed transfer of $4.1 billion. However, alternative measures such as invoking the Feed and Forage Act or using Navy and Air Force funds to support Army operations may have limitations and disadvantages. These options could reduce financial flexibility, disrupt day-to-day operations, and weaken congressional war powers and controls on fund usage. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, including $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. Supplemental funds include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill provides $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping and $12.0 million for International Broadcasting. Supplemental funds include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. Table 2 summarizes the FY2008 defense supplemental appropriations proposals, including the Administration request, House-passed bills, and the final $70 billion emergency funding legislation. The original House-passed bill required a plan to withdraw U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008, while the final legislation included reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. The $50 billion bridge fund approved by the House in November 2007 mandated the President to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq within 30 days of enactment. The House-passed bill required the President to withdraw troops from Iraq within 30 days of enactment, setting a target date of December 15, 2008 for completion. It allowed a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorists. H.R. 4156 stated Congress's desire to end the war quickly and safely, extended prohibitions on torture, and required units to be fully mission capable before deployment. It also mandated an immediate redeployment of forces from Iraq and called for a comprehensive strategy for stability in the region. The bill set a goal of transitioning U.S. armed forces to a limited presence in Iraq by December 15, 2008, with restricted missions focused on protecting U.S. facilities, training Iraqi security forces, and conducting counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports were required on transition plans, and additional funding consideration was linked to these reports. A comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East was also mandated, along with quarterly reports to establish performance measures for stability in Iraq. Senators Levin, Reed, Voinovich, Hagel, Snowe, Reid, and Salazar proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The Senate failed to approve the measure with a vote of 50-45, reflecting ongoing support and opposition to the war in Iraq. On December 18, Senators proposed an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months. The Senate rejected the measure with a vote of 24-71. The approved $70 billion fund for FY2008 did not include troop withdrawal requirements but mandated regular reports on stability in Iraq. The Administration requested a total of $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations, international affairs, and other activities in FY2008. This included $141.7 billion for military operations abroad, $3.3 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. Additional requests were made for mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles and an extra $45.9 billion for military operations and international affairs programs in FY2008. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations, international affairs, and other activities in FY2008. This included $141.7 billion for military operations abroad, $3.3 billion for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. The funds were designated as \"emergency\" spending to exempt them from spending caps in the congressional budget resolution. The budget resolution for FY2008 includes a restrictive definition of emergency spending, allowing for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. This designation may permit some requested spending without exceeding budget limits in the Senate. Supplemental appropriations bills often exceed White House requests and can include significant legislative initiatives. The FY2007 supplemental bill, for example, included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, children's health insurance, and a minimum wage increase. Additional \"emergency\" funds were expected for Hurricane Katrina recovery in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In FY2008, Congress provided funding for Hurricane Katrina recovery and other non-defense programs in a continuing resolution attached to the defense appropriations bill. The resolution included funds for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA disaster relief, and wildfire management. Additionally, $16.8 billion was allocated for MRAPs in previous bills. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, provided $5.2 billion for MRAP vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps, almost meeting the requested amount. The omnibus appropriations bill included $70 billion, with $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operations, $11 billion for Navy and Air Force operations, and funds for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces. Additionally, $4 billion could be transferred between accounts for future Defense Department operations. The $189.3 billion requested for military operations in FY2008 continues a trend of increasing funding for the Defense Department through supplemental appropriations. The growth in funding is not solely due to the pace of military operations but also to investments in repairing and upgrading equipment. The funding for military operations in FY2008 has increased to replace lost or worn-out equipment, upgrade ground forces, and train Afghan and Iraqi military forces. There have been significant increases in weapons procurement and operation and maintenance funding, as well as funding for reorganizing the Army and increasing troop numbers. The Defense Department has allocated funds for force protection, support to foreign security forces, and reconstitution of the force. The Defense Department has allocated funds for force protection, support to foreign security forces, and reconstitution of the force, with Secretary Rumsfeld preferring the term \"reset\" over \"reconstitution\" to describe the needed changes in the force. The concept of reconstitution now encompasses more than just restoring the force to its pre-war condition. The Defense Department has allocated funds for force protection, support to foreign security forces, and reconstitution of the force, with upgrades to equipment for Army and Marine Corps units. Congress has generally supported steps to upgrade ground forces, with questions raised about specific equipment funding requests. The Administration withdrew requests for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and a V-22 tilt rotor aircraft to realign funding for the troop surge. The amended defense request includes funding for MRAPs and costs of maintaining additional Army and Marine units in Iraq. Additional funds were allocated for Iraqi security forces and equipment upgrades for ground forces. The budget amendment includes additional funds for Iraqi security forces, reopening factories in Iraq, and construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also allocates money for repairing and replenishing equipment, improving Navy aircraft radar detection equipment, and restocking equipment inventories for combat support units. The budget amendment includes $2.5 billion for various initiatives, such as fuel price increases, accelerating construction of facilities, improving Army medical facilities, and supporting soldier and family programs. The Administration also requested $6.897 billion for international affairs in FY2008. The $6.897 billion budget request for international affairs in FY2008 includes funding for State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, the West Bank, Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimated emergency supplemental funding needs for various programs, with two-thirds allocated for Diplomatic and Consular Program funding for Iraq Operations. Foreign Operations comprise $3.678 billion, with nearly half allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush Administration has been criticized for relying too heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. The Administration has been criticized for relying heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, particularly for Iraq and Afghanistan. In February 2007, the original FY2008 State Department emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq, with additional funds later added for various programs. Total emergency funds requested for FY2008 for the State Department's Administration of Foreign Affairs amounted to $3.220 billion in addition to the regular budget request. The State Department requested $2.523 billion for Iraq operations, with $978.7 million allocated for security needs and $907.1 million for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). The Administration requested funding for various expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan, including security, living accommodations, information technology, vehicles, and leases of space. This included $162.4 million for security upgrades in Afghanistan, $160 million for U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, $53 million for U.S. assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and $723.6 million for U.S. contributions for international peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided regular and supplemental funding for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The Consolidated Appropriation Act (P.L. 110-161) includes $1.262 billion in supplemental funds for the Department of State, with $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) and $468.0 million for U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping (CIPA). $575.0 million is designated for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection (WSP) within D&CP. $390 million is allocated for Darfur and $78 million for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds within CIPA. Still pending is $333.6 million for Darfur. The Department of State received $1.262 billion in supplemental funds, with allocations for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping, Iraq operations, and worldwide security protection. Additional funds were designated for Darfur and FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping. Emergency supplemental funds for the BBG totaled $12.0 million, with no specific allocation requirements mentioned. The Foreign Operations portion of the supplemental request totaled $3.678 billion, with significant amounts allocated for Economic Support Funds for various countries. Anti-narcotics emergency supplemental funding for FY2008 totaled a requested $734 million, with a focus on Mexico and Central America. The requested $734 million for anti-narcotics funding includes the largest portion allocated for Mexico and Central America ($550 million). Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) totaled $230 million, mainly for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) would fund programs in Iraq with $80 million. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service. A $350 million request for P.L. 480 food aid would support programs in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, and Sudan, with a $30 million contingency fund for future needs. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations, but the exact allocation remains unclear. The Administration has discretion over the allocation of supplemental funds approved by Congress, including $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. No funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs in Mexico and Central America, and the West Bank and Gaza. Up to $42 billion in U.S. funds had been appropriated for Iraq until the passage of the omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill. In FY2008, almost all funding for Iraq reconstruction came from an emergency supplemental measure, with $4.9 billion requested. This included $3.7 billion for Department of Defense reconstruction appropriations to train and equip Iraqi troops. The $3.7 billion funding for Iraq reconstruction includes training and equipping Iraqi troops under the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF) and reconstruction grants provided through the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). CERP allows military commanders to support various economic activities at the local level with small grants, including infrastructure efforts like repairing electric generators and constructing sewer systems. Additionally, the CERP has funded salaries for the Sons of Iraq, who work with U.S. forces to provide security. A $100 million request was added to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq, aimed at stimulating the economy and creating employment for Iraqi citizens. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for Iraq includes $1.2 billion directed towards rehabilitating state-owned enterprises to stimulate the economy and create employment. Challenges include lack of electricity, security issues, and limited interest from U.S. companies. The funding includes $797 million in the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and $100 million for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) in Iraq aims to stabilize areas through small-scale economic projects, job training, and capacity building for local government officials. An additional $25 million was added to the ESF supplemental request to establish a new Iraq enterprise fund. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, similar to models in east Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Polish Fund, established to support mortgage lending markets and private equity funds, has had varying levels of success. While some funds have made profitable investments, others have struggled due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Some question the funds' effectiveness as their development goals may conflict with economic profit pressures. The INCLE account focuses on rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform efforts. The MRA request addresses the refugee crisis in the region, with millions of Iraqis displaced due to violence and instability. In response to sectarian violence and instability, 2.2 million people have been displaced, leading to a request for emergency funds for medical care, food, shelter, and relief efforts. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid but rejected most economic assistance requests for Iraq, only approving around $250 million for humanitarian programs. Congress approved $250 million for humanitarian demining, refugee assistance, disaster relief, the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund, and the rescue of Iraqi scholars. This brings the total funding for Iraq reconstruction since 2003 to $44.8 billion. The Administration is seeking an additional $3 billion in emergency aid for Iraq. In 2006, insurgent threats to Afghanistan's government escalated, raising doubts about U.S. stabilization efforts. Despite challenges, Afghanistan has made progress with a new constitution, successful elections, and increased personal freedoms. Insurgency led by remnants of the Taliban regime intensified in 2006. Women are increasingly participating in economic and political life. Next elections are planned for 2009. The Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan escalated in 2006, posing a significant threat despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations. Slow reconstruction, corruption, and the Taliban's presence in rural areas contribute to their resurgence. Concerns about reconstruction funding distribution and narcotics trafficking persist. Some Taliban commanders operate from across the border in Pakistan, beyond the reach of U.S./NATO forces. The Reconstruction Opportunity Zones initiative aims to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped regions. The United States and its partners focus on strengthening the central government and security forces in Afghanistan to combat insurgent challenges. Weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to democratic progress and reconstruction efforts. The Administration requested $839 million for reconstruction in FY2008, including provisions to stabilize Afghanistan and promote economic reconstruction. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests include funding for the ESF, democratic governance, and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. This includes allocations for strengthening provincial governance, investing in basic social services, and promoting economic growth. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests include $170 million for economic growth and infrastructure in Afghanistan, including power sector and road projects. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in economically isolated areas. $5 million in Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs is also included to support Afghan leadership. The Government of Pakistan has a FATA Sustainable Development Plan with a five-year $750 million development support from the State Department and USAID. The U.S. Agency for International Development has proposed a five-year $750 million development assistance strategy for the frontier region, aiming to improve economic and social conditions in the FATA to combat terrorism. This includes governance, health, education services, and economic development initiatives. After President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in 2007, U.S. assistance was under review, but was resumed in 2008 following a credible national election in Pakistan. The Administration requested $60 million in emergency supplemental funding for Pakistan in FY2008 to meet the full pledge of $150 million, with allocations for governance, health, education, and economic development. In contrast, Sudan received $868.6 million in amended emergency supplemental funding for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur, in addition to regular appropriations in the FY2008 budget. In FY2008, Sudan received $868.6 million in emergency supplemental funding for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur. This included $70 million for upcoming national elections, $723.6 million for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), and $468 million in the Consolidated Appropriations. The elections are estimated to cost nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment. The curr_chunk discusses a $1 billion anti-narcotics package for Mexico and Central America, funded by the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Account. Mexico would receive $500 million for border security technology, while Central American countries would get $50 million for border security and justice sector improvements. Regular funding for Mexico and Central America in FY2007 and FY2008 is also mentioned. Additionally, the FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million for the Palestinian Authority government to focus on rule of law, economic growth, and governance issues. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million for the Palestinian Authority government, focusing on rule of law, economic growth, and governance issues. The funds consisted of ESF funds for various purposes such as governance, health care, job creation, infrastructure, trade, investment, agriculture, and budget support. Additionally, $25 million in INCLE funds would be used for training the Presidential Guards and National Security Force, and $35 million in MRA funds for Palestinian refugees. Congress allocated $542.6 million in emergency ESF, with $155 million for the West Bank and Gaza, and $200 million in emergency MRA funds provided. The Administration proposed $106 million in ESF funds for North Korea as part of the Six Party commitments. In February 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for assistance from the United States and other Six Party Talks members. The U.S. committed $106 million in ESF funds, with $25 million authorized in FY2007 and $106 million to be provided in FY2008. The omnibus bill allocated $53 million in ESF funds for North Korea, without designating them as emergency. Additionally, the Administration sought funding for unforeseen humanitarian needs, including $350 million in additional assistance. The Administration requested $350 million in additional assistance for humanitarian needs, including emergency food aid in Darfur, eastern Chad, southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Kenya. Additionally, $230 million was requested for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million allocated for Iraqi refugees and $35 million for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon."
