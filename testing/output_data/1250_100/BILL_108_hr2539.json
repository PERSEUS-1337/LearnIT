    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violence Against Children Act of 2003\". Congress finds that children under 18 make up a significant portion of crime victims, with high rates of sex crimes and kidnapping. They are also more likely to be victims of violent crime compared to adults. Many crimes against children go unreported, leading to long-lasting negative effects such as delayed development and substance abuse. Lack of resources in local agencies hinders their ability to protect children and families in need. Failure to pay child support is considered a form of neglect. Children who do not receive financial support are more likely to live in poverty, leading to inadequate education, lack of quality health care, and affordable housing.
