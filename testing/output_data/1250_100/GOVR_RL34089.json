    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, renew key user fee programs like PDUFA and MDUFMA. FDA urged Congress to act before August 1, 2007, to avoid layoffs. FDA used reserve funds to prevent layoffs. The FDA has implemented a hiring freeze due to funding uncertainty, causing morale issues among employees. Legislation reauthorizing FDA programs also addresses pediatric pharmaceuticals and other concerns. FDA regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The FDA is responsible for postmarket surveillance of regulated products for safety. Products may enter commerce with little oversight, but the FDA can withdraw unsafe products. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding, especially for products requiring premarket approval. Key issues include balancing the need to speed safe products to market and ensuring product safety for human foods, animal feeds, and other products not requiring premarket approval. The FDA collects user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approvals. There are concerns about the agency relying on these fees, with calls for increased appropriations instead. Reauthorization of user fee authorities PDUFA and MDUFMA is underway, with these fees making up a significant portion of FDA's budget. PDUFA was first enacted in 1992 and has been reauthorized twice. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 authorized the FDA to collect fees from companies for drug and biological product reviews. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications and added new regulatory requirements. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA are related to user fees and performance goals. Researchers often did not test drugs on children, leaving clinicians with limited options for pediatric patients. In 1997, Congress passed BPCA to incentivize pediatric drug research with extended marketing exclusivity. FDA's attempts to require pediatric assessments in new drug applications were codified in PREA in 2003. BPCA and PREA provide incentives for studying pediatric use of drugs. Developing medical devices for children is challenging due to lower demand and unique physical attributes. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to incentivize manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and give the FDA authority to require postmarket studies for approved devices. These studies are necessary to ensure continued efficacy and safety, as some adverse effects may only become apparent after a product is on the market. The bills also focus on strengthening the FDA's data collection system for marketed products and providing new authorities for the FDA to take action when needed. The FDA is being given new authorities to require manufacturers to take action on products that merit FDA action. Medical journals tend to publish only positive clinical trial results, leading to concerns about the lack of disclosure of negative trial results for FDA-approved biomedical products. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions for public registration of clinical trials and posting results. FDA uses advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, but may not always follow their recommendations. In 2006 and 2007, media reports highlighted bias and conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees regarding drug approval. Legislation like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aims to address conflicts of interest among committee members. FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical product submissions in 2004, calling for modernization of scientific tools to improve product development. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed to support the FDA in utilizing innovative study designs and biomarkers to evaluate medical product safety and effectiveness. Some lawmakers are exploring ways to allow importation of prescription drugs from foreign sources to lower costs while ensuring safety regulations are met. The FDA has had responsibility for regulating food safety since 1906, with recent outbreaks of foodborne illness prompting congressional attention. S. 1082 addresses some food safety issues, but not all, in a comprehensive FDA reauthorization and reform bill. The bill also includes provisions for drug importation with a requirement for the Secretary of HHS to certify safety and cost-effectiveness. The report describes key FDA programs addressed in bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, and more. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) gives FDA revenue from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite product reviews. PDUFA expires in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) established a collaboration between agencies and industries to set performance goals for review times. PDUFA led to decreased application review times and increased premarket review activities. PDUFA II and III gave FDA limited authority to use fees for postmarket drug safety. Discussions for PDUFA IV in 2007 focused on postmarket drug safety. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, reauthorizing fees for application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. The bills also expand the use of fees for postmarket safety activities. Both the Senate and House bills propose using fee revenues of $393 million annually for drug safety activities, including adverse event data collection and improved analytical tools. The House bill goes further than the Senate bill in listing specific safety activities. Both bills increase requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public. The House bill exempts orphan drugs marketed by smaller companies from certain fees. Additionally, both bills introduce a new fee for pre-release review of drug advertisements, with manufacturer requests being voluntary and FDA responses being advisory. The Senate bill proposes new fees for manufacturers requesting reviews, including advisory and operating reserve fees. It would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation for PDUFA reauthorization. The House bill includes safety activities and exempts orphan drugs from certain fees, introducing a new fee for pre-release review of drug advertisements. The House bill does not amend the FFDCA but includes reauthorization and report requirements. It also requires the Secretary to make negotiation minutes publicly available before presenting recommendations to Congress. User fees for medical device reviews were introduced by MDUFMA in 2002, with provisions for premarket reviews, third-party inspections, and regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority for user fees expires in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, which also contain other provisions for medical device regulation. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 through FY2012. They include provisions for lower fee amounts for FY2008, an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012, and the addition of three new types of fees. The bills also exempt government entities from certain fees and extend requirements related to medical device fees from FY2007 to FY2012. The bills propose changes to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, including lower fee amounts for FY2008, an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012, and the addition of new fees. They also extend requirements related to medical device fees from FY2007 to FY2012 and authorize specific appropriations for postmarket safety information review on medical devices. Both bills aim to reduce fees for small businesses, change qualification criteria, allow foreign firms to qualify, and establish a new refund policy for withdrawn applications. They also require annual reports from the Secretary through FY2012, with additional requirements in H.R. 2900 for postmarket safety activities and in S. 1082 for public disclosure of previous cohorts of medical device applications. The bills mandate FDA consultation with various groups for performance goal recommendations, publicizing recommendations, allowing public comments, and holding public hearings. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to revise medical device regulations by providing public comment periods, revising recommendations based on feedback, and requiring transmittal to Congress. The bills also include user fee provisions with different effective dates and extend the authority for third-party reviews of premarket notifications. Additionally, they contain provisions to streamline inspection requirements by accredited third parties. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to revise medical device regulations by expanding participation in the program, allowing device companies to submit reports by third parties for FDA consideration, and streamlining registration requirements. The bills would restrict the registration period to between October 1 and December 31 of each year and amend electronic registration regulations to require electronic filing as a default. FDA has approved many products for adult use without testing in children. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by extending market exclusivity by six months for compliant studies. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved drugs for children can lead to ineffective treatment or inappropriate dosing due to differences in drug metabolism and side effects unique to children. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) requires pediatric studies for off-patent products and authorizes NIH funding for these studies. It reauthorized exclusivity provisions for on-patent drugs and mandated pediatric testing data submission for new drug applications. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) gave FDA authority for pediatric assessments and remains in effect as long as BPCA is active. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA for another five years, through FY2012, with provisions for research on off-patent products, labeling changes based on pediatric studies, and reporting adverse events. The bills differ on the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 proposing a reduction to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. Additionally, both bills seek to expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA and PREA. They also include legislation to encourage pediatric medical device development by amending the humanitarian device exemption. This exemption allows manufacturers to market devices for small patient populations without proving effectiveness, helping patients with rare diseases. The bills exempt some pediatric device manufacturers from selling products above costs, promoting development for small markets. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the new exemption for pediatric medical devices. They require funding for research and development, with H.R. 2900 also mandating a plan for expanding pediatric device research. Both bills emphasize connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing device development, and providing business assistance. Coordination with NIH and FDA is required, along with reporting on grant effectiveness and impact. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 both aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development. They require grantees to report on effectiveness, impact, and device development status annually. Both bills authorize $6 million for demonstration grants and amend BPCA to include pediatric medical devices. Postmarket surveillance measures would be incorporated to assess the impact of pediatric medical devices. H.R. 2900 allows for extended studies beyond the 36-month limit to evaluate pediatric device impact on growth and development. It includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers and follows the FDA's safety and effectiveness requirements for drug approval. FDA acknowledges that no drug is completely safe, but evaluates if it is safe enough for its intended use. FDA and others must remain alert to new information as drugs are used more widely. Some widely used drugs were found to be more dangerous than expected, leading to concerns about industry's transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety concerns. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was asked to examine FDA's handling of drug safety, resulting in a 2006 report addressing organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's ability to identify and correct postmarket drug safety problems. Both the Senate and House bills aim to strengthen FDA's postmarket safety activities by establishing public-private partnerships for risk identification, requiring postmarket studies, and implementing a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drug applications. The bills differ on timetables and criteria for REMS submission. The House and Senate bills aim to strengthen FDA's postmarket safety activities by implementing a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drug applications. The House bill requires pre-approval to ensure benefits outweigh risks, while the Senate bill focuses on serious risks and the need for REMS to assess or mitigate them. Both bills include core elements for REMS, such as timeframes, instructions, and monitoring systems. Waivers from REMS restrictions are allowed for certain medical countermeasures during declared public health emergencies. The Senate and House bills propose creating a mechanism for access to drugs with a REMS for off-label use in serious or life-threatening conditions during public health emergencies. They include structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement processes. Both bills establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board and require reviews of approved REMS at specified times. The bills also require evaluation of REMS elements to ensure safe use of drugs without limiting patient access. The Senate and House bills propose mechanisms for drug access during public health emergencies, including structured follow-through and enforcement processes. They establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board and require reviews of approved REMS. The bills also evaluate REMS elements to ensure safe drug use without limiting patient access. The bills differ on criteria for postapproval studies or clinical trials, with the Senate bill focusing on serious risk assessment and unexpected risks, while the House bill authorizes studies based on scientific information to assess known or serious risks. The bill proposes a multi-level process with time limits for safety labeling changes, involving the Drug Safety Oversight Board and potential penalties for violations. Both House and Senate bills include provisions for advertisement review and require clear presentation of side effects. The Secretary can order labeling changes based on new safety information, with differences in criteria for decision-making between the bills. Both House and Senate bills propose new enforcement tools for the FDA, including fines of up to $250,000 per violation for REMS violations. The House bill also includes additional civil penalties for ongoing violations, while both bills allow the Secretary to consider non-compliant drugs as misbranded. Separate civil penalty authority is established for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads, with fines of up to $250,000 for first violations. The Senate bill proposes lower fines for drug safety violations compared to the House bill, with fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation and up to $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill allocating $25 million annually for surveillance and assessment activities. Additionally, the House bill includes provisions for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs, public meetings on orphan antibiotic products, and grants for orphan drug development. The Senate bill includes provisions for antibiotics as orphan products, with $35 million authorized annually. It also mandates standardized packaging for prescription drugs and incentives for antibiotic development. The House bill focuses on securing the distribution system against counterfeit drugs and requires DTC ads to include information on reporting adverse effects to the FDA. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety, requiring the establishment of an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and the development of website content with extensive drug safety information. It also mandates that state-legalized medical marijuana adhere to FDA regulations and awards priority review vouchers for neglected or tropical disease products. Additionally, it requires the FDA Commissioner to publish a list of authorized generic drugs and prevent certain citizen petitions from delaying agency decisions. The FDAMA created federal registration requirements for clinical trials, currently required for drug trials treating serious conditions. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding trial types and information in the registry, including results publication. They would require registration for most drug, device, and biologic trials, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays public release of medical device information until FDA approval. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding the types of clinical trials required to be registered, including drug, device, and biologic trials. They would also require the responsible party to comply with the provisions of the bills, with H.R. 2900 specifically requiring control over data and the right to publish trial results for a principal investigator to serve as the responsible party. Additionally, both bills would expand the information required to be included in the registry and ensure its accuracy. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose expanding the types of clinical trials required to be registered, with H.R. 2900 specifying additional elements such as disclosure of agreements restricting result publication. S. 1082 includes more criteria for the searchable registry and a timeline for making information public. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for creating a results database, while S. 1082 focuses on linking to public trial results information. H.R. 2900 specifies instructions for the results database, including searchable categories, timing of submissions, and truthfulness of information. A requirement for non-promotional summaries was removed, replaced by a study on promotional content. Results of pre-approval studies must be made public within 30 days of certain events, such as an NSE letter from the Secretary. The timing provision in the legislation could lead to the early disclosure of clinical trial information for devices pending FDA action. Both bills include provisions for coordination, compliance, and enforcement. H.R. 2900 focuses on registry and results database requirements, while S. 1082 only addresses registry provisions. H.R. 2900 also includes enforcement measures for results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database. One controversial provision in H.R. 2900, not present in S. 1082, would have allowed causes of action. The legislation in question includes specific penalties for noncompliance with FDA requirements, with H.R. 2900 allowing penalties of $10,000 per day and capping at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits, while S. 1082 allows penalties of $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills also address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees, with H.R. 2900 not amending relevant FFDCA sections and S. 1082 amending them. The legislation addresses penalties for noncompliance with FDA requirements, with specific penalties outlined in H.R. 2900 and S. 1082. Both bills also address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees, with proposed changes to the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waivers. The new provisions would expand requirements to all advisory committees providing advice to the FDA. Advisory committee members may need to disclose conflicts, refrain from voting, or not participate based on the nature of the conflict, as outlined in various laws governing advisory committee members. The legislation addresses conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees, requiring disclosure of financial interests and discouraging conflict waivers. Recruitment mechanisms focus on experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups. H.R. 2900 allows non-voting guest experts with financial interests if deemed necessary by the Secretary. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees by requiring full financial disclosure, precluding voting by conflicted members, allowing waivers for essential expertise, and establishing a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission. Annual reports on conflict-of-interest waivers and updates to FDA guidance are also mandated. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees by requiring full financial disclosure, precluding voting by conflicted members, and establishing a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission. The Foundation would establish goals and priorities relating to unmet needs and then coordinate with federal programs, award grants, contracts, and other agreements to advance those goals. The bills would direct the Commissioner to transfer funds to the Foundation and require the Secretary to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA Office of the Commissioner. S. 1082 (Title VIII, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2007) would allow importation of drugs for commercial and personal use, with detailed procedures for safety and cost savings. A second-degree amendment added by the Senate requires certification from the HHS Secretary for implementation. The addition of this amendment has nullified the original language of the title. Food safety is addressed in S. 1082 in Title VI and other provisions, while H.R. 2900 does not contain any food provisions. Title VI of S. 1082 focuses on regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, including an early warning system for identifying adulteration and disease outbreaks. It also requires the Secretary to coordinate food safety programs and establish a registry for adulterated food. The Secretary would review and validate information on adulterated food before taking any food authority action to protect the public. Alerts would be issued for food linked to repeated outbreaks or adulteration. Responsible parties must maintain records and report to the FDA on adulterated food. Deliberate adulteration cases must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security. Regulations and standards for reporting suspected adulteration cases would be established. Annual reports to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions would be required. Certain provisions in S. 1082 Title V would require reports on various food issues, including pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards from substances used in fresh meat, color additive certification, environmental risks of genetically engineered seafood, marketing of crustaceans, risk detection, and aquaculture inspection regime. The bill also includes a provision prohibiting imports from foreign food facilities that deny access to U.S. inspectors and authorizes enhancing FDA inspection for aquaculture and seafood through partnerships. S. 1082 includes provisions for the sale of pet turtles, reports on genetic test safety, FDA report on tanning device labeling, and Senate's sense on FDA regulation flexibility and intellectual property rights. House bill addresses public-private partnerships. The House bill requires the Secretary to enter into collaborative agreements with educational or tax-exempt organizations to implement the FDA Critical Path Initiative, authorizing $5 million for FY2008 and additional funds for FYs 2009 through 2012."
