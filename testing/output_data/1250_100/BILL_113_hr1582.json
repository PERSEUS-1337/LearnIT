    "content": "The Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013 prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing energy-related rules costing over $1 billion if they will have significant adverse effects on the economy. Prior reports and determinations are required before finalizing such rules. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including the rule, costs, benefits, and data reliability. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including preserved data for public review, potential energy price increases, and employment effects. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct an independent analysis to assess the impact of a proposed rule on energy prices, fuel diversity, electric reliability, and energy supply. If adverse effects are found, a subsequent determination will be made regarding the rule's impact on the economy. The Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, will assess if a rule will have significant adverse effects on the economy by considering costs, benefits, and economic indicators. Results of this determination will be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This section defines terms like \"direct costs\" and \"indirect costs\" according to EPA guidelines. It also explains what constitutes an \"energy-related rule that is estimated to cost more than $1 billion\" and the definition of a \"rule\" as per US Code.
