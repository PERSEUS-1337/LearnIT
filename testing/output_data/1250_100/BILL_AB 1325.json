    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Delta smelt, a vulnerable species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, has been protected under state law since 1993. Threats to the smelt include habitat loss, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 aims to implement a comprehensive strategy for the sustainable survival of the Delta smelt and other sensitive species in their native habitat. This includes investments to ensure water supplies for public health, safety, and economic interests in California. Immediate action is needed to address the critical condition of the Delta smelt population, with a Delta smelt hatchery being a key element in improving habitat conditions and species recovery. In this chapter, key definitions include \"banking partner\" as an entity participating in the Delta Smelt Hatchery Program, \"Delta\" as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, \"Delta smelt\" as a specific fish species, \"mitigation bank\" as a fish hatchery for Delta smelt population increase, and \"mitigation banking agreement\" as a deal for receiving mitigation bank credits. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program aims to preserve and restore the Delta smelt population by establishing a genetic refugia population, developing broodstock, and providing fish for supplementation of wild populations. The program includes designing and constructing at least one hatchery by January 1, 2019, at a suitable site within or adjacent to the delta. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program includes developing a hatchery management plan in consultation with scientific experts, establishing a mitigation bank for take authorization, and entering into agreements with banking partners to address the impact on Delta smelt populations. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program involves setting financial contributions for banking partners to ensure funding for the Delta smelt hatchery operations. Mitigation banking agreements allow for permits authorizing incidental take for participating partners. Delta smelt reared for various purposes can count towards mitigation credits, with excess hatchery production creating credits for future obligations under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta Smelt Hatchery Program receives funding from banking partners for long-term operation and maintenance. Costs for hatchery planning, design, and construction are allocated funds, with audits conducted every three years. The department can contract with public agencies for hatchery operations and may partner with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for compliance with program requirements. The department will collaborate on long-term Delta ecosystem solutions, including a program under Section 1712. Protections for Delta smelt under state law will not be reduced, illegal taking is prohibited, and compliance with the California Endangered Species Act remains necessary."
