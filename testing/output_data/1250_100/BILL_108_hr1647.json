    "content": "The \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings related to crane conservation. Congress finds that crane populations in many countries have experienced serious decline, endangering species in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five Asian crane species are listed as endangered, and the Crane Action Plan identifies several threatened species from Africa and Asia. The blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane are listed species. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered with low population numbers. Conservation efforts are insufficient to address the decline in crane populations due to hunting and habitat loss. Cranes are important for wetland and grassland conservation. The establishment of crane conservation programs would benefit numerous species, including endangered ones. Threats to cranes include egg collection, poisoning, collisions with power lines, disturbance from human activities, and trapping for sale. International cooperation is needed to address these threats. Cranes serve as ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. The threats facing cranes and their habitats are similar on all continents where they occur. Conservation efforts for cranes are similar worldwide, with successes in one region applicable to others. Collaboration between conservationists in the United States and other countries is crucial for protecting threatened cranes. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods and procedures to ensure the population of crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, management plans, enforcement, and community involvement. The Crane Conservation Act emphasizes conservation efforts through community participation, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution initiatives, and community outreach and education. The Act defines terms such as \"Convention\" as per the Endangered Species Act of 1973, \"Fund\" as the Crane Conservation Fund, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Crane Conservation Act focuses on community involvement, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution, and education. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects approved by the Secretary. Applicants from relevant wildlife management authorities in certain regions can submit project proposals for crane conservation projects. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects approved by the Secretary. Applicants from relevant wildlife management authorities in certain regions can submit project proposals for crane conservation projects. Project proposals must include a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of individuals responsible, methods for implementation and assessment, and staff and community management details. The Secretary will review project proposals for crane conservation projects, which must include details such as project logistics, funding estimates, government support, matching funding sources, and any other necessary information. Within 30 days of receiving a final proposal, the Secretary will share it with appropriate Federal officials for review and approval. The Secretary will consult with other Federal officials and review project proposals to determine if they meet criteria. Within 180 days of receiving a proposal, the Secretary will consult with the government of each country involved, approve or disapprove the proposal, and notify the applicant and relevant officials. The Secretary may approve a project proposal under this section if it enhances conservation programs for cranes by addressing conflicts with humans, promoting compliance with laws, developing scientific information on crane habitat and population, and fostering cooperative projects among governmental entities. The Secretary may approve project proposals that focus on conservation efforts for cranes, including scientific research, successful reintroduction into the wild, training for staff, and ensuring long-term sustainability. Preference is given to projects that promote effective conservation and have matching funds available. Each recipient of assistance must report on their project. Each recipient of assistance for conservation projects must submit reports to the Secretary periodically, including necessary information for project evaluation and public availability. The Secretary will convene a panel of experts biennially to identify conservation needs for cranes. The Crane Conservation Fund is established under Section 6. The Crane Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. It consists of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. The Fund allows for expenditures to provide assistance as determined by the Secretary, including administrative expenses. The Crane Conservation Fund allows the Secretary to spend up to 3% or $80,000 for administrative expenses each fiscal year. Additionally, no more than 50% of the Fund can be used for projects related to North American crane species conservation. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for investing the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury may sell the Fund at market price, with interest and proceeds from obligations credited to the Fund. Transfers to the Fund are made monthly based on estimates, with adjustments for accuracy. Donations can be accepted by the Secretary for assistance under section 5, with amounts transferred to the Treasury for deposit in the Fund. SEC. 7. ADVISORY GROUP.\n\nAn advisory group may be convened by the Secretary to assist in conservation efforts for cranes. The group must hold open meetings allowing public participation and provide timely notice and minutes. \n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$3,000,000 is authorized for the Fund annually from 2004 to 2007, to be available until expended."
