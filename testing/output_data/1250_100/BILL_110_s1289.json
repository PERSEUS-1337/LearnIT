    "content": "The \"Veterans' Justice Assurance Act of 2007\" repeals term limits for judges of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, allowing judges to hold office during good behavior with a 15-year term limit for existing judges. SEC. 3. INCREASED SALARY FOR CHIEF JUDGE OF UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS. The annual salary rate for a judge serving as chief judge of the Court shall be increased by $7,000. SEC. 4. PROVISIONS RELATING TO RECALL OF RETIRED JUDGES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS. The amendment eliminates the limit on service of retired judges who voluntarily serve more than 90 days. It also specifies that retired judges recalled after retirement will receive pay based on their rate at the time of retirement. The amendment removes the service limit for retired judges serving voluntarily and clarifies that recalled judges will receive pay based on their rate at retirement. The pay of a recall-eligible retired judge is based on their rate at retirement, with adjustments for annuity amounts. Retired judges serving voluntarily have no service limit, and a notice provided by a retired judge is irrevocable. The amendment to Section 7257 of the title establishes guidelines for recalling retired judges based on caseload thresholds and factors such as active judges, caseload complexity, and fluctuations in workload. The amendment also exempts certain judges from involuntary recalls based on specific criteria. The judge must consult with specific organizations, the bar association of the Court, the Secretary, and other entities as deemed appropriate. SEC. 5. Additional discretion in imposition of practice and registration fees. Amends Section 7285(a) of title 38, United States Code to allow for reasonable imposition of fees. SEC. 6. Annual reports on workload of United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The chief judge of the Court shall submit an annual report to Congress summarizing the workload of the Court for the last fiscal year, including appeals, petitions, applications, dispositions, time to disposition, oral arguments, pending cases, and service by retired judges. The chief judge of the Court submits an annual report to Congress summarizing the Court's workload for the last fiscal year, meeting the requirements of section 7257(b)(5) of this title. The term 'appropriate committees of Congress' refers to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 72 of the title. The chief judge of the Court submits an annual report to Congress summarizing the Court's workload for the last fiscal year, meeting the requirements of section 7257(b)(5) of this title. SEC. 7. REPORT ON EXPANSION OF FACILITIES FOR UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS. Congress finds that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is currently located in a commercial office building in the District of Columbia. In 2006, a feasibility analysis was provided for a dedicated Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center. The Court suggested leasing additional space in the current location, which would require relocating other government tenants. The feasibility report did not consider the feasibility or desirability of locating the center at the Court's current location. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims should be provided with appropriate office space that reflects its importance in serving veterans. A report will be submitted on the feasibility of leasing additional space within the current building without causing disruption to other federal entities. The report will analyze the feasibility of converting a building into a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center, including the impact on federal tenants, relocation options, and steps for conversion. Federal tenants will have an opportunity to comment before the report is completed. Before the report is completed, federal tenants will have the opportunity to comment on the subject and a draft of the report required by paragraph (1)."
