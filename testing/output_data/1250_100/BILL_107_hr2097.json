The Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001 highlights the importance of early learning and nurturing care for children's development. Research shows that quality early care leads to cognitive abilities, positive behavior, and long-term success. However, many child care centers do not provide adequate care, and the cost of full-day child care is high. Federal assistance is limited, making it difficult for families to afford child care. Many families struggle to afford child care, with costs consuming a significant portion of their income. Low reimbursement rates impact the quality of care children receive, leading to potential delays in development and behavioral issues. Increasing payment rates can improve the quality of child care provided. Increasing payment rates in child care can lead to higher quality services by allowing providers to attract qualified staff, offer salary increases, provide professional training, maintain a safe environment, and purchase necessary supplies. The purpose of this Act is to enhance the quality and accessibility of child care through increased payment rates. The Act aims to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child care. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to authorize appropriations of $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent years for grants under section 658H. Block grant funds are to be used from funds appropriated under section 658B(a) for the purpose of improving the quality of child care. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to establish a program under section 658G(a) and grants to improve the quality of child care under section 658H. Grants are provided to improve the quality of child care under section 658H of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The Secretary will use appropriated funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys and application submissions. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys and application submissions, including detailed methodology, results, and plans to increase payment rates. Annual payments are contingent on the State's progress in implementing the activities. The State must maintain increased payment rates and update surveys every 2 years to receive grants for child care services. State contributions of at least 25% of costs are required in cash, excluding federal funds. Allotments are based on appropriations for eligible States. An eligible State receiving a grant must increase payment rates for child care assistance up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Once reaching this rate, funds can be used for activities enhancing child care quality. The funds should supplement, not replace, other federal, state, or local funds. The eligible State must submit evaluations to the Secretary on efforts to increase payment rates for child care. The Secretary will report to Congress biennially on State progress in maintaining increased payment rates. Payment rate refers to reimbursement rates for subsidized child care. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to specify funding sources. Changes are made to the allotment process, including adjustments to subsection references and terminology."
