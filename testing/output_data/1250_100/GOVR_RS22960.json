Investors and speculators ignored risks, leading to a market crash with the Nikkei stock market dropping significantly. Banks suffered as the value of their stock holdings plummeted. The bursting of the economic bubble in Japan in the late 1980s led to a drastic reduction in capital reserves for banks, with unrealized capital gains dropping significantly. Commercial land values in major metropolitan areas fell by 80%, causing the value of collateral underlying bank loans to decrease. This financial crisis also impacted commercial real estate ventures, leading to lower profits and excess capacity in companies. Non-performing loans in Japan's banks reached $280 billion in 1995, contributing to the overall slowdown of the Japanese economy. During the global economic crisis, Japanese financial institutions did not heavily rely on collateralized debt obligations or derivatives. Mortgage defaults were mainly on commercial property, not private residences. Japan had no subprime loans, and lending was often relational rather than market-based. Banks extended loans based on close corporate ties, leading to non-performing loans. The bursting of Japan's real estate and stock bubbles caused economic growth rates to drop from over 5% to less than 2% in the 1990s. The 1990s saw Japan experience a slight increase in growth in 1996 followed by a recession in 1998 and 1999 due to fiscal policy tightening and the Asian Financial Crisis. The economy remained weak in the early 2000s after the 2001 recession. Japan's lost decade was characterized by an extended L-shaped recession caused by the bursting of stock and real estate bubbles in 1989 and 1990. The government initially used forbearance to address the banking crisis, protecting depositors and providing emergency liquidity. During Japan's banking crisis in the 1990s, the government intervened extensively to prevent major banks from sinking. The \"community banking mentality\" led banks to continue lending to defaulting firms, creating more non-performing loans. In 1992, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company was established to help banks dispose of these non-performing loans, similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the United States. The Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) in the United States operated from 1989-1995, dealing only with real estate collateral loans. In 1993, top banks sold \u00a51.3 trillion in non-performing loans to the CCPC, accounting for 54% of all write-offs that year. The CCPC worked by banks extending credit for the purchase cost of non-performing loans, with the hope that bank profits and equity gains could fund loan write-offs. The CCPC recovered about half of the underlying value through asset sales. During Japan's financial crisis, the Bank of Japan's low interest rate policy allowed banks to make higher profits. Despite writing off $318 billion in non-performing loans, new ones continued to appear rapidly. The government implemented multiple stimulus packages between 1992 and 1995, leading to a slow economic recovery. However, the situation worsened in 1995 with the bankruptcy of housing loan companies. In 1996, the government injected capital to purchase assets from struggling housing lenders, which was politically unpopular. The burst speculative bubble in 1995 led to a weak economy due to policy errors by Japan. By 1997, Japan's banking sector was in a systemic crisis, with the government providing $250 billion for banks. In 1998, the Japanese government provided financial support to banks by injecting billions of dollars, taking over bankrupt banks, and implementing new laws and regulations. By 2005, the banking sector had recovered with non-performing loans at a tolerable level of 3.5% of total lending. During the 1990s, the Japanese government implemented various stimulus packages to combat the effects of the crisis, including monetary policy, direct intervention, and fiscal measures. These packages were aimed at boosting the economy and were referred to as \"real water\" to indicate new spending. The total amounts for the packages may have been misleading due to items already included in previous budgets or packages, and some funds may not have been spent until the next fiscal year. Parliamentary approval was also required for parts of the packages, and the figures for the percentages of GDP should be considered upper bounds. During the 1990s, Japan implemented stimulus packages to boost the economy, including monetary policy and fiscal measures. The Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan administered bank rescue operations, providing assistance through various forms like direct grants, loans, and guarantees. The DICJ also insured bank deposits and managed funds totaling $399 billion out of $495 billion announced for financial assistance. The DICJ provided financial assistance totaling $399 billion, including grants, asset purchases, and capital injections. Funds were sourced from DICJ bonds, deposit insurance premiums, and recovered assets. Capital injections were made into 25 banks, with $31.3 billion still held by DICJ in various forms. The DICJ provided financial assistance totaling $399 billion, including grants, asset purchases, and capital injections. This included preferred shares, common shares, and subordinated loans. The $51 billion in the \"Other\" category included loans to banks under special public management, asset delivery for latent defects, compensation for losses, lending to financial institutions, and debt assumption. The Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC) borrowed funds from DICJ to purchase and dispose of assets, making a profit by selling assets purchased at a discounted price. The RCC consulted with the Purchase Price Examination Board on asset prices. Japan's government debt soared as the economy stagnated, with central government debt rising from 47% of GDP in 1990 to 106% in 2000. In 2008, the US had a debt of 40% while Japan's was at 167%. The Ricardian equivalence theorem suggests that government deficits lead to increased saving by individuals anticipating future tax increases. One analysis of Japan's experience in the 1990s found that fiscal stimulus packages had expected multiplier effects despite high saving rates and rising government debt. Tax cuts targeting the most liquidity constrained had the largest effects. However, pursuing stimulus without addressing non-performing loans or economic deregulation muted the impact of fiscal deficits on growth. In 1996, Japanese authorities focused on reducing the budget deficit. The Japanese government aimed to reduce the budget deficit by implementing the Fiscal Structural Reform Act in 1997. However, this tightening of fiscal policy may have prolonged the recession as the government overestimated the economic recovery. By 2003, the government debt-to-GDP ratio had risen to 141% and the government deficit to GDP ratio had increased to 5.4%. Despite efforts to reduce the debt burden, the national debt continued to grow even during periods of strong economic growth. The Japanese government reports two categories of expenditures for servicing the debt: Interest Paid and National Debt Service. National Debt Service includes interest paid, redemption of the national debt, and administrative expenses. Interest payments as a percentage of federal government expenditures have declined for both the United States and Japan. This decline is attributed to the drop in interest rates as part of the government's monetary policy. The question for both nations is whether this trend can continue given the large fiscal deficits being incurred.

The question is whether this trend can continue given the large fiscal deficits being incurred in 2009. Observers have gleaned lessons from the Japanese experience, such as underestimating the seriousness of the banking problem and the importance of transparency in realizing the true extent of financial problems. Rescues of ailing financial firms by healthier institutions were common. The Japanese government injected capital into ailing financial institutions through various methods, including buying troubled assets at a discount, nationalizing and later selling banks, and providing stock subscriptions and grants. The Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan played a key role in managing emergency financial assistance, with the government giving it permanent authority to assist troubled institutions when necessary. Between 1998 and 2003, Japan's banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans despite receiving $495 billion in financial support packages. The government's holdings of corporate shares generated income for the DICJ. Recovery efforts focused on a few large banks and fewer than 200 smaller financial institutions. Japan's early financial rescue package had stringent conditions that banks ignored, leading to worsened economic conditions. Assistance to failing institutions carried enforced conditions by the DICJ. The bursting of the real estate bubble in Japan made risk management difficult for financial regulators as it affected the value of collateral on bank lending. Japan's slow response to monetary and fiscal policies, along with banking sector issues, worsened economic conditions. Recovery efforts were focused on large banks and a few smaller financial institutions."
