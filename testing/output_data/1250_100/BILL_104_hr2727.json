It requires regulations proposed by the executive branch to be approved by Congress before taking effect, promoting accountability and democracy. SEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS requires congressional approval before regulations can take effect. Agencies must submit a report to Congress explaining the proposed regulation. SEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS outlines procedures for swift congressional review of agency regulations. (a) Introduction.--Within three legislative days of an agency submitting a report under section 3(b), the Majority Leader of each House of Congress must introduce a bill containing the regulation text. If not done, any Member of that House may introduce the bill.\n(b) Bill.--A \"bill\" refers to a congressional bill where the agency regulations are approved and become law.\n(c) Referral and Consideration.--The bill does not go to a committee and any Member can move to consider it the day after announcing their intention. All objections to the bill are addressed during consideration. The motion to proceed with the bill is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate. It is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. Once agreed to, the respective House immediately considers the bill without interruption. Debate is limited to one hour, with equal time for supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to further limit debate is permitted. The motion to proceed with the bill is privileged in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. Once agreed to, the respective House immediately considers the bill without interruption. Debate is limited to one hour, with equal time for supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to further limit debate is permitted. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair regarding the application of regulations shall be decided without debate. Final passage of the bill must occur within 60 days of introduction, with an exception for a motion to suspend this rule. Upon receiving a bill from the other House, it will not be referred to a committee and can only be considered for final passage. The procedure in the receiving House remains the same, but the final vote will be on the bill from the other House. Once the bill from the other House is dealt with, the original bill in the receiving House cannot be considered. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" in accordance with existing laws. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to agency regulations made after its enactment. SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Regulations in bills under this Act are not subject to judicial review as agency actions."
