    "content": "The \"Sell Fuel Efficient Cars Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a Passenger Automobile Trade-In Program. The \"Sell Fuel Efficient Cars Act of 2008\" defines terms like \"automobile\", \"fuel\", \"manufacturer\", and \"passenger automobile\" according to section 32901 of title 49, United States Code. An \"eligible individual\" is someone with no more than 3 registered passenger automobiles, who filed a Federal income tax return for 2007, and whose adjusted gross income meets certain criteria. An eligible individual for the \"Sell Fuel Efficient Cars Act of 2008\" must have an adjusted gross income not exceeding $25,000 ($40,000 for joint filers or heads of household), not acquired a car under the Program, and not filed jointly with someone who acquired a car. An eligible new automobile for the Program is a passenger car that has never been registered and is manufactured by a company with operations in the United States. To be eligible for the \"Sell Fuel Efficient Cars Act of 2008,\" a person must have an adjusted gross income below $25,000 ($40,000 for joint filers or heads of household) and not have previously acquired a car under the Program. The eligible new automobile must be manufactured by a company with operations in the United States, have a fuel economy of at least 25 miles per gallon, and meet specific manufacturing criteria. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines fuel economy using specific methodologies for eligible new automobiles under the \"Sell Fuel Efficient Cars Act of 2008.\" If the methodologies have not been used, estimates may be made. The term \"eligible old automobile\" refers to a passenger car that is operable, was first registered at least 10 years before the trade, is registered under the individual's name, and was registered before December 1, 2008. \"Fuel economy\" is the average miles traveled per gallon of gasoline, determined by the EPA Administrator. The \"Program\" refers to the Passenger Automobile Fuel Efficiency Program. The Secretary will establish the Passenger Automobile Trade-In Program to provide subsidies for eligible individuals to purchase new automobiles in exchange for old ones. The Program will start upon regulation prescription and end on December 31, 2009. Eligible trades will receive $10,000 for the purchase of a new automobile. The Secretary may not make payments for a trade if the new automobile's purchase price exceeds the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Delayed payments will include interest. An eligible individual and seller initiate a trade by driving the old automobile to the seller's location. The Program requires the eligible individual to trade in their old automobile for a new one at the seller's location. The individual must pay the difference between the purchase price of the new automobile and the amount provided by the Secretary. The old automobile must be disposed of properly by the seller, and the Secretary will compensate the seller for the costs incurred. The Secretary will prescribe rules for the Program within 30 days of enactment, with expedited rulemaking procedures. Appropriations are authorized for the Program, designated as an emergency requirement."
