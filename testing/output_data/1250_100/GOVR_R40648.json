    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care, increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House Ways and Means Committee proposed a surtax on high-income individuals, while the Senate Finance Committee reported a bill relying on an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, passed on December 24, 2009, reflects revenue-raising provisions including an excise tax on high-cost employer plans. President Obama proposed changes to this bill, delaying the tax on high-cost plans to 2018 and raising the exemption threshold. The new plan also includes a 3.8% tax on unearned income for high-income households. The House passed the Senate proposal on March 22, 2010, and it was signed into law on March 23. The tax proposals in the enacted bill differ in their effects on behavior and income distribution. Taxes may fall more heavily on higher-income taxpayers (progressive change), equally on all taxpayers (proportional change), or lower-income taxpayers (regressive change). For example, limiting itemized deductions and high adjusted gross incomes increases taxes for top income earners, while limiting health-related tax exclusions affects middle-income brackets proportionally more. Excise taxes tend to be regressive, impacting lower-income classes more. The revenue raisers proposed in the health care reform bills include an increased Medicare tax, a fee on health insurance providers, a \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, and a fee on branded drugs. These provisions account for a significant portion of the revenue over a 10-year period. The health care reform bills propose revenue raisers such as increased Medicare tax, fees on health insurance providers, a \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, and a fee on branded drugs. These provisions account for about 90% of revenues over a 10-year period, with shares changing over time due to delays and expirations. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue- and tax-related provisions to fund health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. More details on individual provisions can be found in the proposals discussed in the report. The America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 (H.R. 3200) was later included in the Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, which passed on November 14, 2009. The main modifications in H.R. 3962 involved changes to the surtax on high-income taxpayers and additional revenue raisers. The initial proposal in H.R. 3200 included a surtax on individual taxpayers generating $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014, with rates ranging from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 included revenue raisers related to international taxation, tax evasion, and health-related tax purposes. This included provisions to raise funds through changes in foreign tax credit allocation, treaties to avoid U.S. tax, economic substance doctrine, and expanding the definition of dependents. H.R. 3962 includes revenue raisers such as a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint returns, international taxation measures, and restrictions on health-related tax provisions. These measures are projected to raise billions of dollars over a specified period. The proposed revenue raisers in H.R. 3962 include increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies, imposing an excise tax on medical devices, and requiring information reporting on payments to corporations. Other provisions involve extending health benefits for spouses and dependents, fees on health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. The Senate Finance Committee proposal and the legislation under consideration, discussed in the \"Senate Proposal\" section, include provisions from the Finance Committee bill and H.R. 3962. The surtax on high-income individuals targets the top 1.2% of taxpayers, with only 0.3% affected by the proposal. Concerns have been raised about the impact on small businesses and entrepreneurship, with approximately 4% of businesses initially affected. Other parts of the health proposal could also impact small businesses positively or negatively. The committees' summary indicates that 1.2% of unincorporated businesses would pay the revised surtax, affecting a larger share of income for higher-income individuals. Returns with income over $1 million account for 15.1% of adjusted gross income but only 0.2% of returns. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels, with individuals earning over $1 million accounting for 33% of unincorporated business net income. Individuals with incomes over $500,000 make up 39% of the total, mainly from partnership and Subchapter S firms. Returns with income over $1 million account for 7.5% of total proprietorship income, while returns with income over $500,000 make up 12.6%. For partnerships and Subchapter S firms, returns with income over $1 million represent 49% of net income, and over $500,000 represent 64% of net income. Taxpayers at the top tax rate are responsible for 61% of business flow-through income. Partnership income is mostly in limited liability companies or limited partnerships, including passive income and income from tax shelters. The Treasury study showed that high-income taxpayers with passive income accounted for 46% of positive business income. The Tax Policy Center found that only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income exceeding half of total income, indicating much of the income is passive investment income. Partnership income, mainly from finance, real estate, oil and gas, and services, reflects activities less focused on entrepreneurship and job creation. About 8% of total income comes from real estate and oil and gas, 19% from finance and insurance. The Treasury study revealed that high-income taxpayers with passive income made up 46% of positive business income. Only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income exceeding half of total income, indicating a significant portion of income is passive investment. Small business income is associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, who may not be significant sources of job creation for lower-income individuals. Small businesses create more jobs but also experience the greatest job loss, offering fewer benefits and lower pay. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a permanent policy to create jobs, suggesting that the economy creates its own jobs over time. It also mentions the possibility of excluding certain types of business income from a surcharge, such as income from finance, real estate, insurance, and professional services. Additionally, it highlights the revenue effects of different provisions in a bill. The curr_chunk discusses proposals in the Senate Finance Committee to disallow spending on over-the-counter medications from tax-favored plans. It also includes health-related tax expenditures and provisions related to corporation taxes and the tax gap. The excise tax on medical devices is briefly discussed as a revenue-raising measure in both House and Senate bills. The House and Senate bills propose a tax on medical devices, with the Senate version imposing a fixed fee. The House bill suggests a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers, which may be passed on to consumers. The tax could impact investment in new devices, but the effect may be mitigated by health insurance coverage. The interest allocation proposal in the tax bill would repeal a 2004 provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. This change would affect how foreign taxes are credited against U.S. tax liability, potentially increasing allowable foreign tax credits. Another provision aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. The tax bill proposes to repeal a provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit and aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. Additionally, the bill includes provisions to codify the economic substance doctrine, requiring transactions to meet both objective and subjective tests to prevent tax avoidance. H.R. 3962 proposes more specific rules for tax arrangements to ensure consistency in courts. It includes a provision for firms to report payments to corporations over $600 to aid in tax enforcement. This may increase compliance burden on businesses, especially those with different tax years. The change aims to simplify reporting by not requiring firms to determine corporate status. The provision in H.R. 3962 modifies the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuels with water, sediment, or ash content like black liquor. Black liquor was previously eligible for the credit but is now excluded. This change was seen as unintended, as black liquor was used by the paper industry to qualify for a blended fuel credit. Proposed Legislation by [author name scrubbed] aims to expand reporting requirements for payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year. The goal is to increase third-party reporting to address unreported income, particularly from small businesses. The revision includes expanding reporting to corporations, a proposal supported by both parties for years. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to address unreported income from small businesses by including small firms in corporate status and reporting on goods as well as services. This change is expected to simplify compliance and increase enforcement of information reporting. Businesses have criticized the increased cost and administrative burden of these provisions. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which includes provisions for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain thresholds. The bill aims to raise significant revenue, with the largest provision targeting high-cost health coverage. Additionally, there are suggestions to scale back reporting requirements to address concerns about resource allocation and potential compliance burdens. The Senate Finance Committee introduced provisions in S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, including a 40% excise tax on high-cost health coverage to raise significant revenue. H.R. 3590 also included revenue raisers such as an increase in the payroll tax for hospital insurance for high-income earners, a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, and changes in the treatment of Blue Cross. Other provisions in H.R. 3590 included a temporary fee on insured and self-insured plans, liberalized adoption credit, and exclusion of assistance for state student loan repayment programs for certain health professionals. The proposal in S. 1796 includes various revenue-raising measures such as a fee on medical devices, health insurance providers, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities. It also imposes a fee on health plans and an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000. The revenue raising provision in S. 1796 includes a 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for joint returns, projected to raise $86.8 billion. Other provisions include requirements for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on health benefits, and a safe harbor for small employers. There are also revenue losing provisions such as a therapeutic discovery project credit, exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs, and changes to the adoption tax credit. Additionally, there are discussions on excise taxes on health insurance coverage, fees on drugs, medical devices, and cosmetic procedures, as well as an increased HI tax. The tax falls on insurance companies, plan administrators, and employers for certain self-insured plans. It is not deductible and is expected to be passed on to individuals through higher premiums or reduced benefits. This provision is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years. The thresholds for the tax would be increased by the CPI plus one percentage point, with higher limits for plans in states with higher costs and for those over 55. The excise tax on high-cost health plans, implemented in 2014 and increased by 5% in 2015, would have higher limits for individuals over 55 and in risky professions. The thresholds for single and family plans would be $9,850 and $26,000 respectively for qualifying exceptions. A study showed that 90% of plans would be unaffected by the Senate Finance Committee version of the provision. The excise tax aims to discourage rising healthcare costs, with revenue estimates suggesting more plans may be affected over time. The excise tax on high-cost health plans, implemented in 2014 and increased by 5% in 2015, aims to discourage rising healthcare costs. The tax would be collected at the insurance-company level or health insurance plans' costs would be reduced, potentially affecting lower-income employees. H.R. 3590 would increase the HI payroll tax for high earners. The provision in H.R. 3590 imposes a tax on compensation exceeding $200,000 for single persons and $250,000 for joint returns, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. Employers would collect the tax, which targets high-income taxpayers and is progressive. Additional revenue comes from fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices, totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. Fees on health insurance providers and medical devices increase over time. The fees on medical devices are $2 billion per year from 2011 through 2017 and $3 billion per year thereafter. The fee on branded drugs is $2.1 billion per year. Fixed nominal aggregate fees will become less important over time. Fees on insured and self-insured plans are smaller ($2.6 billion) and expire after September 31, 2019. These taxes could increase prices, reduce profits, and be passed on to insurance companies. Providers may benefit from increased demand due to expanded health insurance coverage. All three provisions for fees provide for a fixed amount of revenue to be collected. The fee exempts certain devices with a retail cost $100 or less, designed to exclude small items like pregnancy tests, contact lenses, and blood pressure monitors. The medical device fee and branded drug fee have a sliding scale to reduce the impact on small producers. Total sales for the medical device fee are calculated with the first $5 million not counted, and 50% of the amount over $5 million but less than $25 million counted. For drugs, the shares vary based on sales. Insurance premiums and third-party administrator fees have specific exclusions and inclusions. The fees are not deductible and are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment. H.R. 3590 imposes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, expected to raise $2.7 billion over 10 years. There was discussion about taxing cosmetic producers, but it was not included in the final bill. Hospitals classified as charitable organizations receive tax exemptions and other benefits under current law. The Congressional Budget Office found that nonprofit hospitals provided slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals. Concerns were raised about the benefits of federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals, estimated at $6 billion in 2002. Hearings were held by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee on the topic of charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals, including charity care and community benefits provided. The IRS released a report on nonprofit hospitals' charity care spending, with the median share of revenues at 3.9%. Concerns were raised about the lack of specific standards for charity care to qualify for exempt status. Senator Grassley authorized a round-table discussion on the draft proposal to codify rules for determining charitable status. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow reductions in taxable income to fund certain program benefits, chosen under a cafeteria plan or provided by the employer. Concerns about these plans include the \"use it or lose it\" nature, with amounts forfeited at the end of the year. Both the House and Senate bills limit these arrangements to $2,500, with H.R. 3590 indexing the amounts by the CPI after 2011. The cost of over-the-counter medication does not count for purposes of the itemized deduction for expenditures. The provision in both the House and Senate bills aims to align eligible spending for employer health accounts with the itemized deduction rules, disallowing tax-excludible expenditures on over-the-counter medication. The itemized deduction for medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income benefits about 12 million taxpayers, mainly those with high medical costs relative to income, and is estimated to cost $10.7 billion per year. This deduction is more beneficial to middle-class taxpayers due to the percentage-of-income floor. The medical expense deduction is more beneficial to middle-class taxpayers, with higher-income groups claiming a smaller percentage of this deduction. The deduction may incentivize individuals to forgo insurance and has an uneven subsidy effect based on tax rates. The Senate bill increases the deduction floor to 10%, remaining at 7.5% for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. The taxation of unearned premiums was approximated in 1986, resulting in a revenue loss of about $1 billion annually. Blue Cross and Blue Shield lost their tax exemptions in 1986 due to their activities being deemed similar to commercial insurance. A proposal in the Senate bill aims to disallow tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. The Obama Administration released a compromise proposal in 2010, modifying revenue provisions and delaying the tax on high-cost health insurance plans until 2018. The President's compromise proposal in 2010 modifies the tax on high-cost health insurance plans from Senate-passed H.R. 3590, delaying it until 2018. The proposal raises the exemption amount for families to $27,500 and for individuals to $10,200. To offset the revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers, including a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate for married couples earning over $250,000 and individuals earning over $200,000. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment on certain unearned income is proposed for high-income earners. The President's proposal in 2010 aims to modify the tax on high-cost health insurance plans, delaying it until 2018. It includes raising the exemption amounts for families and individuals. To offset revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers and includes a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate for certain earners. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment on certain unearned income is proposed for high-income individuals. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872, with the Senate considering the latter. Amounts paid by firms for employee health insurance are excluded from wages and not subject to income or payroll taxes. The exclusion of deductible contributions from taxable income, including those made through HSAs and FSAs, has been a topic of discussion in various proposals. Options have included capping the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance based on a benchmark plan or income limits. The employer exclusion, the largest health-related income tax benefit, has been scrutinized for its significant revenue loss. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated this loss at $144.8 billion in 2008. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated the revenue effect of capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs in 2009 to be $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and continuing to rise. The revenue from a cap depends on whether it is indexed or not, with potential growth projections if not indexed or indexed for general price inflation. The revenue effect of capping health benefits at the 90th percentile of employer health insurance costs in 2010 was estimated to be $4.9 billion, rising to $188.8 billion in 2019 if not indexed. Caps need to be indexed to health price inflation to maintain a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion has been criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing the purchase of excessive insurance, leading to increased healthcare costs. The tax advantages of employer health care insurance are greater for high-income individuals due to higher marginal tax rates. The payroll-tax exclusion benefits are not as targeted towards higher-income families, as they are subject to flat rate taxes with an income cap. The tax benefit may not rise as a percentage of income, suggesting that repealing the tax benefit would not necessarily be progressive. The tax effects of repealing the exclusion for employer health care insurance show a proportional tax change across middle income brackets, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. The average tax increase cannot be directly tied to the size of the health insurance benefit package, and the exclusion is supported for reducing adverse selection in the health care market. The exclusion of employer health insurance benefits is supported to reduce adverse selection in the health care market. Concerns exist about altering tax subsidies affecting employer participation. Imposing a cap on the exclusion could address the issue of excessive insurance purchasing without significantly impacting coverage. Challenges include determining includable income for tax purposes and potential inequities. Economic costs of health insurance vary by location and number of individuals covered. The cost of employer health insurance benefits can vary based on factors such as geographic location, number of individuals covered, age, sex, and health status. This can lead to implicit cost shifting, where certain groups subsidize others. While varying benefits by health status may not align with the risk-sharing objective of insurance, variations based on family coverage, age, and location are legitimate considerations. However, including age as a factor could result in significant income inclusions for older individuals, potentially burdening them with higher costs. Requiring income imputations that do not vary with age may shift the burden towards higher incomes, impacting younger individuals with lower incomes. Imputed income from health benefits not varying by age may create inequities across employees based on characteristics like gender, age, and health status. Adjustments for these characteristics could add to administrative burden. Benefits included in income could follow COBRA benefit rules. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 allows for continuation of insurance on leaving a job. The Senate Finance Committee options include reformulating the exclusion as a deduction, credit, or a combination. Credits would equalize treatment across taxpayers, and restricting deductions for employers could raise revenues and discourage overly generous health insurance packages. Explicit issues of assigning benefits to individual employees would not arise. The Senate Finance Committee's report lists various health-related income tax expenditures, including the exclusion of Medicare benefits from income for tax purposes ($40.6 billion) and the exclusion of medical benefits for military dependents and retirees ($3.3 billion). Health savings accounts (HSAs) allow tax-deductible contributions and tax exclusions for medical expenses, with a cost of about $0.5 billion per year according to JCT estimates. The Finance Committee options paper discusses limiting HSA contributions and increasing penalties for non-medical uses. Distributions from HSAs would only be tax-exempt for medical costs with employer or third-party verification. The proposals also include HSA contributions under a general employer cap. The government's position on FICA tax exceptions for students, especially medical residents, has been uncertain. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to extend Medicare coverage and associated taxes to all state and local employees, including those hired before March 31, 1986. This provision would increase health insurance payroll taxes, leading to higher Medicare costs. Additionally, the proposal discusses excise tax provisions on alcoholic and sugared beverages, as well as potential increases in tobacco taxes. The alcohol tax rates vary for different beverages, with distilled spirits taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon, beer at $18 per barrel, and wine based on alcohol content. These taxes are levied per unit and have not been revised frequently, with the last revision in 1991. If adjusted for inflation, the tax on distilled spirits would be around $19.60 currently. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, have consequences for health costs and are larger than current taxes. Consumption is responsive to price changes, and taxes tend to be regressive, collecting a larger percentage of low-income individuals' income. Distributional data on federal excise taxes is limited, with the latest data from a 1990 study. Expenditures on alcoholic beverages as a percentage of income by quintile show a concentrated burden on lower income classes. Higher income classes tend to purchase more expensive alcohols, making alcohol taxes regressive. The tax burden relative to income could be significantly greater for top quintiles. Excise taxes on alcohol are more regressive than sales taxes due to their unit tax nature. However, alcohol taxes are not as regressive as tobacco taxes because alcohol consumption tends to increase with income. The proposal aims to increase taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits to address these issues. The proposal aims to increase taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits. The tax on table wine at a 12.5% alcohol level would be $3.88 per gallon. Current federal alcohol taxes collect $9.4 billion in revenues, with increases in taxes for distilled spirits, wine, and beer. The increase in price should result in a decrease in consumption, but recent price elasticity estimates suggest consumption is not highly responsive to price. The elasticity for beer consumption is 0.16, for wine consumption is 0.58, and for spirits consumption is 0.39. The overall elasticity for a proportional change in price is 0.52. Current sales of alcohol total $187.6 billion. Applying these elasticities suggests a decrease in consumption for beer, wine, and spirits. Older elasticity estimates were higher. A tax proposal on non-diet sweetened beverages could raise significant revenue. The tax proposal on non-diet sweetened beverages could raise about $17 billion. The tax may be regressive and some question singling out this food source. Itemized deductions for taxpayers include taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions. The largest deductions are for mortgage interest and taxes, with income taxes making up the majority. President Obama's tax proposal aims to cap itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers to 28%, raising revenues by about $25 billion. This provision primarily affects taxpayers with incomes over $250,000, with the top 2% of incomes being impacted. The $200,000-to-$500,000 income class accounts for 11.4% of itemized deductions, while the $500,000-and-over income class accounts for 14.6%. The tax proposal aims to cap itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers at 28%, affecting those with incomes over $250,000. The $500,000-and-over income class accounts for about 14.6% of itemized deductions, with a significant portion going towards charitable contributions. Studies suggest a modest 1% reduction in charitable giving due to the limit on tax benefits. Higher-income individuals may see larger effects on charitable giving for health, art, and education causes. The tax proposal aims to cap itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers at 28%, affecting those with incomes over $250,000. Various commentators suggest different options for limiting deductions, with potential revenue gains ranging from $1 billion to $141 billion in 2011. President Obama also proposes base-broadening provisions to finance health care reform, including measures to reduce the tax gap and increase compliance. Other provisions target financial institutions, tax accounting methods, and estate tax valuation discounts. The tax proposal includes provisions to limit valuation discounts in the estate tax, raising around $5 to $6 billion per year. Key provisions include restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of certain inventory valuation methods. Other potential income tax provisions for additional revenues include rate increases, widening rate brackets, and increasing tax rates on dividends and capital gains. Burman suggests reducing indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% for more accurate cost of living adjustments. The tax proposal aims to raise revenue by adjusting capital gains tax rates, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reforming international tax enforcement, and repealing LIFO inventories. These measures are estimated to generate significant revenue, with potential increases in payroll taxes as well. Additionally, the proposal includes provisions to limit valuation discounts in the estate tax, raising around $5 to $6 billion per year. Burman suggests various options to raise revenue, including increasing payroll taxes for both employees and employers, eliminating the Social Security earnings cap, implementing a 10% value added tax (VAT) for $600 billion in revenue, and considering a carbon tax or cap and trade system. However, implementing these new revenue sources may come with administrative compliance issues and transition problems. Table A-1 compares revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590 with those enacted into law in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
