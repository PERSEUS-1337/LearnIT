    "content": "The \"Airline Passenger Fairness Act\" is the short title of the Act. The Act includes findings related to airline passengers. The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to increase to 1 billion by 2008. The number of certified large air carriers has decreased, with 6 major carriers forming 3 large networks. Many communities that had air service in 1978 no longer have it, and fares on 75 city pairs increased by 30% in 1997. The Department of Transportation found that large US air carriers charge significantly higher fares at hub airports without low fare competition. Complaints about airline travel have increased, with a rise in complaints against large US carriers. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission reported worsening flight delays, with a forecast of increased delays in the future. The Federal Aviation Administration forecasts a 52 percent increase in US domestic and international passenger enplanements between 1996 and 2006, with annual growth in revenue passenger miles averaging 4.2 percent. A 1998 Department of Transportation study revealed that large US air carriers charge 60 percent more for passengers traveling to or from small communities compared to those traveling between large communities. Congress has directed the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry. SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS. Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code is amended to include specific practices for certificated air carriers, such as informing passengers about oversold flights, allowing the use of portions of a ticket, timely delivery of checked baggage, and providing full access to all fares. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code requires certificated air carriers to provide passengers with full access to all fares, notify passengers of flight delays, accurately inform passengers of flight disruptions, refund unused tickets within 48 hours, and disclose information on frequent flyer programs for informed decision-making. The Secretary must report violations of airline regulations in the monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, including details on confirmed reserved space for passengers on specific flights."
