    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress recognizes the highly toxic nature of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It acknowledges the risks posed to unborn babies and children from mercury exposure, primarily through contaminated fish consumption. The long-term solution to mercury pollution involves minimizing global mercury use and releases to reduce environmental contamination levels. Mercury pollution from sources like mercury cell chlor-alkali plants is a transboundary issue. Mercury pollution is a transboundary issue affecting bodies of water globally. In the US, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants use the outdated mercury cell process, with cost-effective alternatives available for the remaining 90 percent. Other countries like Japan have already banned this process. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges the contamination of products with mercury and the release of mercury from the use of these products. Despite the known use of mercury, there is a lack of accountability for its disposition and accurate estimation of current emissions. It is crucial for the US to aggressively work towards minimizing the supply, demand, and releases of mercury domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, particularly focusing on reducing exposures to women of childbearing age and young children. An amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act aims to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report mercury-containing hazardous waste generated annually to the Administrator and the State. The chlor-alkali facility must report details such as mercury content of wastes, waste management methods, volume of mercury released into air or water, accumulation in equipment, and forms of mercury in products sold. The Administrator may allow combining the report for chlor-alkali facilities with reports required under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, a comprehensive mercury inventory must be conducted within 1 year, covering mercury quantities purchased, remaining in equipment, and used in operations. The EPA requires a comprehensive inventory of mercury in chlor-alkali facilities, including mercury in equipment, waste, and products generated. The Administrator will obtain necessary records to determine mercury releases into the environment. An advisory committee called the Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee, composed of 9 members including appointees by the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, the Administrator, the Secretary of Defense, and representatives of State environmental agencies. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will have 9 members appointed by various entities, including State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator will appoint these members within 45 days of the section's enactment. The Committee will hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed and will meet as called by the Chairperson. The Committee will meet as called by the Chairperson, with a majority of members constituting a quorum. Within 1 year of enactment, a report will be submitted to Congress detailing environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, along with the cost of storing mercury and the characteristics of Federal facilities needed for storage. The report to Congress will include details on storing elemental mercury, estimated quantities from various sources, and potential barriers to private sector storage. The report to Congress will cover the 40-year period of storing mercury, addressing barriers, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating storage, optimal storage plan, and additional research needed. Members of the Committee will be compensated accordingly. The Committee members will receive compensation based on the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. Federal employees on the Committee will not receive additional compensation beyond their government salary. Members will also be reimbursed for travel expenses at authorized rates. The Administrator will provide funding and personnel to enable the Committee to perform its duties. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations will be established for the transfer and storage of mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2008. Mercury at closed facilities must be transferred beginning on that date. The Administrator will conduct a health assessment of employees at chlor-alkali facilities still operating as of July 1, 2008. Regulations may be promulgated to carry out this section, including the establishment of reporting forms. Use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
