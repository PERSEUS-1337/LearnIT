    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The peg was upheld by the central bank buying or selling assets to balance demand for the yuan. This fixed rate prevented the yuan from fluctuating despite changing economic conditions. The Chinese government shifted to a more flexible exchange rate system on July 21, 2005, allowing the yuan's value to be determined by market supply and demand. The Chinese government announced a new exchange rate system for the yuan, including a basket of currencies like the dollar, yen, and euro. The U.S. dollar's exchange rate against the yuan was adjusted to 8.11, appreciating by 2.1%. The yuan is allowed to fluctuate daily against the basket, but with tight government controls. This managed float system has led to a slow appreciation of the yuan since 2005, with China accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. China's foreign exchange reserves grew rapidly from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. The yuan has appreciated 16% against the dollar since 2005, leading to concerns about the falling value of the dollar. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, the U.S. remains worried about China's currency policy and its impact on the economy. The economic concerns raised by the United States over China's currency policy, including the undervaluation of the Chinese currency by as much as 40%. This has led to a significant trade imbalance between the two countries, with China accumulating massive foreign exchange reserves and purchasing U.S. federal debt instruments. Policy options to induce China to reform its currency policy, including current legislation introduced in Congress, are being considered. The undervalued Chinese currency has led to a growing U.S. trade deficit with China, impacting U.S. production and employment in various manufacturing sectors. Analysts believe China's currency policy influences other East Asian countries to keep their currencies weak against the dollar. Pressure is mounting on the Bush Administration to address this issue, with calls for China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets. President Bush and officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. Initially, the Administration resisted direct pressure on China to change its currency peg. The Bush Administration initially resisted direct pressure on China to abandon its currency peg, instead seeking to encourage financial system reform and other measures to pave the way for a more flexible currency policy. Pressure increased in April 2005, with Treasury Secretary John Snow stating that China was ready for a more flexible exchange rate. This was driven by complaints from Members of Congress and the introduction of currency bills, including a failed Senate amendment in April 2005 that would have imposed a tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. The Senate Republican leadership reached an agreement with bill supporters to allow a vote on S. 295, sponsored by Senator Schumer, in the 109th Congress. Supporters threatened to bring the bill up for a vote in 2006 but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Significant events regarding China's currency policy included import price increases from China and a 15.9% appreciation of the yuan against the dollar in May 2008. The exchange rate with the dollar was 7.00 yuan, appreciating by 15.9% since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion by March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was launched with $200 billion capital. CIC invested $5 billion in Morgan Stanley. China stated it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets. Regulations requiring firms to convert foreign exchange holdings into yuan were eliminated in June 2007. In June 2007, the IMF clarified currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase net exports. A Section 301 petition was filed over China's currency practices, but the USTR declined it. The Treasury Department annually reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses to determine currency manipulation. The Treasury Department reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses to determine currency manipulation. China was cited for manipulating its currency in the past, but no country has been designated as a currency manipulator since 1994. The focus on China's currency policy has increased in recent years, with criticism of its pace of reforms. Treasury praised China's 2005 currency reforms but noted shortcomings in implementing a more flexible exchange rate mechanism. The Treasury Department's report on China's exchange rate policies highlighted the country's new managed float regime, which was described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. Despite this, the report suggested that the yuan's value was still tightly managed against the dollar. China was not cited as a currency manipulator due to assurances from Chinese officials regarding enhanced currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth. The report acknowledged heavy intervention in currency markets and undervaluation of the yuan but did not meet the technical requirements for currency manipulation under U.S. law. The Treasury Department's report on China's exchange rate policies highlighted the country's managed float regime based on market supply and demand with a basket of currencies. Despite heavy intervention and undervaluation of the yuan, China was not labeled a currency manipulator. Many Members criticized Treasury's decision not to cite China as a manipulator, calling for legislation to revise criteria for such determinations. Chinese officials argue their currency policy is not aimed at promoting exports or discouraging imports. Chinese officials defend their currency policy, stating it is not meant to promote exports or discourage imports. They fear that changing the policy could lead to an economic crisis, especially impacting export industries during ongoing economic reforms. Concerns also arise from rural unrest due to income disparities and government issues. Officials argue that currency appreciation could harm farmers and the underdeveloped banking system may struggle with speculative pressures. China's currency policy is defended by officials to prevent economic crisis and rural unrest. They believe maintaining a fixed exchange rate helps stabilize the economy. U.S. officials suggest reforms to make the currency more flexible, but not an immediate shift to a floating system. China's currency policy operated under a fixed exchange rate until July 2005, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system contrasts with a floating exchange rate, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate based on supply and demand. The central bank needs to adjust the supply of currency to maintain a fixed exchange rate peg when economic circumstances change. This involves increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves to align supply with market demand. China's central bank maintained a fixed exchange rate peg by increasing foreign reserves through buying dollars with newly printed yuan. They hold U.S. financial securities instead of U.S. dollars. China has been rapidly accumulating foreign reserves since 2005, becoming the world's largest holder in 2006. China's foreign exchange reserves have grown significantly, reaching $1.53 trillion in 2007. Despite a managed float system, the yuan has appreciated steadily against the dollar. China's rapid accumulation of reserves suggests that if the yuan were allowed to freely float, it would appreciate even more rapidly. The Chinese government's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves is not solely to prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar. Reserves are also needed for financing international trade and defending against currency speculation. China's rapid increase in reserves has outpaced GDP and imports growth, raising questions about the nature of these reserves and their impact on the yuan's value. The real exchange rate between the United States and China was influenced by inflation rates, leading to fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate. China's higher inflation from 1994 to 1997 caused their exports to become more expensive. However, from 1997 to 2003, China's lower inflation rate led to a convergence of real and nominal exchange rates. By 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994, making their exports cheaper. The yuan has since appreciated, almost returning to its 1998 level in real terms. The real exchange rate between the United States and China is influenced by inflation rates, leading to fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate. In the long run, real exchange rates return to their market value whether fixed or floating. If the yuan were floating, it would appreciate with increased demand for Chinese goods. With a fixed exchange rate, the real exchange rate returns to its market value through price adjustment. This can lead to a trade surplus with the United States, with capital flowing from China to the US through various channels. The Chinese central bank's accumulation of dollar reserves increases the supply of yuan, leading to inflation in China. This inflation causes prices to rise, impacting exports and imports. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide a lasting advantage for exporters. Floating exchange rates adjust more quickly to equilibrium values. Using monetary policy to influence currency value limits flexibility in countering economic changes. China's fixed exchange rate system limits its monetary autonomy, especially when tied to a partner like the United States. However, China mitigates this loss through capital controls. The currency is convertible for trade but not for financial flows, helping to maintain stability. China's fixed exchange rate system limits monetary autonomy, but China retains flexibility through capital controls. Chinese enterprises must exchange foreign currency for yuan, and foreign exchange purchases are regulated. Despite the fixed exchange rate, China can adjust monetary and fiscal policy. The yuan's value has remained stable since 1994, and estimates of undervaluation vary. The author explains how estimates of the yuan's undervaluation were derived, based on the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate and purchasing power parity methods. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve a balanced current account, but this approach is controversial among economists. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. He observed that a 1% decline in the dollar leads to a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit, and concluded that the dollar would need to decline by 40% to eliminate the trade deficit. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003 and argues that the surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, resulting in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in equilibrium. IIE Fellow Morris Goldstein testified that the revaluation required to achieve this reduction in the current account surplus is unusually large due to the extensive use of imports in the production of Chinese exports. Goldman Sachs estimates the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to reduce the U.S. current-account deficit. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde argue China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP. They estimate the yuan was 44%-54% undervalued. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation in 2003 range from 44%-54%, based on simple assumptions rather than complex economic models. The main source of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with no consensus on what that balance should be. This assumption is crucial in determining the required appreciation for China to reach equilibrium. Dunaway et al. show that a small change in the assumed equilibrium current account balance can significantly impact the estimated undervaluation of the yuan. Different economists have varying views on what the equilibrium current account balance should be, with some arguing it should always be close to zero. However, this overlooks the fact that countries with different saving and investment rates may borrow and lend to each other for extended periods. Studies by Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs suggest that China's current account position is actually a deficit when considering foreign direct investment inflows. If these studies had used a balanced equilibrium benchmark instead of a deficit, their estimates of the yuan's undervaluation would have been lower. With capital controls and net FDI inflows, China must increase foreign reserves to prevent a rise in foreign indebtedness. Determining the equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging due to capital controls. If capital controls were eliminated, the economic situation would change, potentially leading to persistent borrowing or lending with the rest of the world by private Chinese citizens. If private citizens lent as much to the United States as the Chinese central bank currently is, the trade deficit would remain unchanged. China's high internal saving rate can finance its investment, offsetting FDI inflows with foreign reserve accumulation. The equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging to determine due to capital controls. Wang argues that foreign reserve accumulation in China should not be seen as proof of undervaluation, as the yuan may actually be overvalued. The FEER approach suggests that revaluing the yuan could help reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit. This approach challenges the idea that China has artificially kept the yuan low, instead arguing that the dollar may be incorrectly valued. The Coudert and Couharde estimate that the yuan is 54% undervalued is based on the belief that the dollar was 35% overvalued in 2003. If trade and financial markets are rational, the value of the dollar and the trade deficit should not be unsustainable. The U.S. trade deficit is not considered unsustainable in the next few years, as it has lasted for several years without hindering economic growth. Even if China reduced its bilateral trade deficit with the U.S., other countries could still lend to the U.S., potentially widening other trade deficits. It is unclear if a reduction in the U.S. trade deficit can solely be attributed to China. The experience of other East Asian countries with current account balances suggests that China's current account balance in equilibrium is uncertain. Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand had deficits, while Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan had surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, all these countries have had large surpluses, indicating a challenging environment for developing world borrowing. China also has large foreign exchange reserves and a current account surplus, similar to other countries in the region. China's current account balance is comparable to its neighbors in East Asia. Estimates of the yuan's undervaluation based on purchasing power parity vary, with the Economist's Big Mac Index suggesting a 56% undervaluation in 2007. However, relying solely on this index has drawbacks as it only considers tradeable goods, like a Big Mac, which may not accurately reflect the currency's true value. Li Ong estimates that most of the value of a Big Mac comes from associated services, not the hamburger itself. Purchasing power parity is unreliable in determining the value of a Big Mac, as prices vary based on local factors. While some economists use PPP to estimate currency values, it is only effective in the long run and has limitations in predicting exchange rates accurately. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to predict exchange rates in the long run, but has limitations. Economist Jeffrey Frankel suggests a relationship between a country's income level and its equilibrium exchange rate based on PPP. China's exchange rate was estimated to be undervalued by 36% in 2000, with potential further undervaluation since then. Coudert and Couharde estimated the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. However, PPP only holds over the long run, and financial flows can cause exchange rates to diverge from PPP for years. The regression analysis does not fully explain the variation in data and suggests a gradual adjustment in exchange rates. The Balassa-Samuelson effect links income levels to exchange rate values, but using proxies like the consumer price index to producer price index ratio may not always yield accurate results. Coudert and Couharde estimated the yuan to be 18% undervalued in 2003, while Benassy-Quere et al. found it to be undervalued by 47% in the same year. Wang's regression suggested the yuan was only modestly undervalued in 2003. Cheung et al. replicated these results but noted that they lacked statistical significance, questioning the robustness of the undervaluation estimates. The Treasury Department's December 2006 report discusses using economic models to estimate currency misalignment. Adding explanatory variables like trade openness reduces estimated undervaluation. Changes in model parameters can greatly affect estimates. Treasury notes the complexity of exchange rate models and their varying conclusions based on different variables used. Treasury Department's report suggests using real effective exchange rates and multiple models to analyze currency misalignments, focusing on prolonged misalignments. Critics of China's currency peg point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as evidence of undervaluation, but bilateral trade balances are influenced by various factors. China had a trade surplus with the United States in 2007, but a deficit with other countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. Despite the rising U.S. trade deficit with China, U.S. exports to China increased significantly, making China the third largest U.S. export market in 2007. In 2007, China surpassed Japan as the third largest U.S. export market. The growing U.S. trade deficit with China is largely due to exports from export-oriented multinational companies, particularly from East Asia, that have shifted production to China for its low-cost labor. Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China have significantly increased their share of exports and imports, importing materials from East Asia for assembly in China before exporting the final products. This has resulted in trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand countries like the United States. The rise in U.S. imports from China is attributed to China becoming a production platform for foreign companies, leading to a trade deficit. Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China have grown significantly, fueled by foreign direct investment (FDI) and export-oriented manufacturing. This trend began in the early 1990s, coinciding with the rapid increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China. FIEs have little impact on China's overall trade balance, as shown in Table 5. Table 5 shows that Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs) have minimal impact on China's trade balance, importing about 80% as much as they export. In Table 6, it is illustrated how foreign multinational companies have shifted production to China, with China becoming the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S. in 2007. This increase in Chinese computer production is attributed to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. The undervaluation of the yuan benefits Chinese export industries and attracts foreign investment, but makes imports more expensive, hurting Chinese consumers and non-exporting firms. This policy may hinder resource allocation efficiency in the long run. In the short run, a revaluation of the yuan could reduce aggregate spending in China by raising imports and reducing exports. Some argue that revaluation would help the overheating Chinese economy and prevent inflation, while others believe it could disrupt the absorption of underemployed labor in rural China. China's currency policy limits the government's ability to use monetary policy for stable economic growth, leading to an economy overly dependent on fixed investment and net exports, which may not be sustainable in the long run. Additionally, the policy may undermine the financial viability of the banking system by increasing easy credit. The easy credit level has made banks more prone to risky loans, leading to an increase in non-performing loans. The policy also attracts \"hot money\" for short-term speculative ventures like real estate and stocks. China's large foreign exchange reserves could facilitate a move towards a fully convertible currency but also pose opportunity costs for funding development needs. China's foreign exchange reserves could be used to fund China's development needs, education system, and bank recapitalization. This accumulation affects exchange rates, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive, leading to a rise in the U.S. trade deficit. China is a major supplier of labor-intensive consumer goods to the United States. Many U.S. industries, including machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die, are concerned about the competitive challenge posed by China due to an undervalued Chinese currency. However, U.S. computer firms benefit from imported computer parts from China, which lowers production costs and increases competitiveness in world markets. Additionally, an undervalued yuan also benefits U.S.-invested enterprises in China and has an impact on U.S. borrowers. An undervalued yuan affects U.S. borrowers by leading to capital inflow from China, boosting U.S. capital investment and lowering interest rates. This results in increased aggregate spending and economic growth in the long run. Household spending on consumer durables and housing also benefits from the lower interest rates caused by the capital inflow from China. China holds a large amount of U.S. Treasury securities, being the second largest foreign holder after Japan. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, the U.S. government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. An undervalued yuan allows the U.S. to increase consumption of goods through improved terms-of-trade, affecting long-term economic well-being. The undervalued yuan increases U.S. consumers' purchasing power, impacting Chinese product prices in the U.S. Import prices from China rose by 4.1% in a year, leading to concerns about job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China, as manufacturing output has reached an all-time high. Manufacturing output has reached an all-time high, leading to a decline in manufacturing employment due to productivity growth. The trade deficit is increasing overall, not just with China. U.S. employment is shifting from manufacturing to the service sector, driven by changing technology and comparative advantage in global trade. The trend of shifting manufacturing abroad is likely to continue regardless of China's currency policy. An undervalued yuan does not significantly impact manufacturing activity or jobs in the United States. It leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by Chinese capital inflows. This shift is expected to have no medium- or long-run effect on aggregate U.S. employment or unemployment. Despite the widening trade deficit with China, the overall unemployment rate has decreased from 6.3% in 2003 to around 5% in 2008. The trade deficit has led to uneven gains and losses in employment and production across regions and sectors of the economy. While the compositional shift in output has no long-term negative effect on aggregate U.S. output and employment, there may be adverse short-term consequences. If output in the trade sector falls faster than the output of U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rises, aggregate spending and employment could temporarily decrease, potentially leading to a decline in the inflation rate. However, government macroeconomic policy adjustments and market forces can help compensate for any decline in output in the trade sector by expanding other elements of aggregate demand. Ultimately, shifting the composition of U.S. output to a higher capital base could lead to a larger economy in the long run. The trade deficit has resulted in uneven gains and losses in employment and production across regions and sectors. Shifting the composition of U.S. output to a higher capital base could lead to a larger economy in the long run, with U.S. workers benefiting from higher productivity and wages. China accounts for a significant portion of U.S. imports, but the trade deficit is primarily due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment in the U.S. The low household saving rate and negative government saving rate in the US result in a trade deficit, with foreigners financing profitable investments. In contrast, China has a much higher gross national saving rate and invests overseas due to excess savings. This difference leads to the US borrowing from abroad to fund its investment needs. The data on current account balances show a 9.0% for China and -6.2% for the United States as a percent of GDP. Both countries would need to adjust their saving/investment patterns to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and China's trade surplus in the long run. Some believe China is moving towards boosting consumer spending, but it may take years to shift from exports to domestic consumption for GDP growth. The United States has a trade deficit with some countries and a trade surplus with others due to comparative advantage. Its low saving rate makes it reliant on foreign financing for investments. The dollar has depreciated against various currencies, which could stimulate economic activity. Some economists fear a sudden plummet in the value of the declining dollar could cause severe dislocations for the U.S. economy due to the unsustainably large trade deficit. They worry that if investors realize significant dollar depreciation is inevitable, they may flee dollar assets, leading to disruptions in financial markets. This scenario, though unlikely, could be costly to the economy and worth guarding against. The primary reason for the dollar's stability since 2002 is due to central banks, including China, accumulating foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. If China and other countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could significantly decline, potentially triggering a currency crisis. The United States has options to pressure China for further exchange rate reforms. China may make further reforms to its exchange rate policy in response to U.S. policymakers' desires. Options for currency reform include making the yuan fully convertible, allowing gradual appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, widening the fluctuation band, and enhancing financial sector reforms for greater currency flexibility. The debate on the best approach to achieve these goals is ongoing. Several Members of Congress have expressed frustration over the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator, believing it would increase pressure on China to reform its currency. The Treasury Department's currency report states that identifying \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" is complex. Proposed bills aim to increase pressure on China to reform its currency. The U.S. government may negotiate with China to change its exchange rate policy. The United States has been pressuring China to reform its currency policy through high-level talks and international forums. China's currency policy has been a major topic of discussion in G-7 finance meetings, with the U.S. urging China to make its currency more flexible. \"In emerging economies with large current account surpluses like China, it is important for effective exchange rates to adjust. The United States could push for G-7 consensus to pressure China on currency reform or encourage talks with other East Asian economies. The goal is to address concerns about competitiveness and promote more balanced economic growth.\" The U.S. government could pressure China to reform its exchange rate system by threatening trade sanctions. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes tariffs on Chinese imports unless their currency appreciates. Supporters believe such measures have been effective in the past, while opponents argue it may violate WTO rules and backfire. Some proposals aim to impose sanctions on countries with misaligned currency policies to avoid violating WTO rules. The United States could potentially file a case against China's currency peg at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, which could lead to trade sanctions if China does not comply. Using the WTO offers a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a favorable ruling. The United States could threaten to initiate a Section 301 case against China under U.S. trade law, which could lead to trade sanctions if China does not comply. Previous attempts to address China's currency practices through Section 301 petitions have been made by U.S. lawmakers and organizations. The USTR declined a petition to bring a trade dispute case against China's currency practices to the WTO. Legislation has been proposed to require U.S. officials to address China's currency policy and modify rules regarding currency manipulation. Commerce Department previously argued countervailing laws couldn't apply to non-market economies like China, but in 2006, they changed their stance. In November 2006, the Commerce Department pursued a countervailing case against Chinese paper products, imposing duties ranging from 11 to 20%. China's economic reforms have made some sectors market-based, allowing identification of government subsidies. Proposed legislation aims to apply countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and address currency manipulation as a form of export subsidy. Critics argue determining subsidies would be challenging. Critics argue that determining the subsidy level conveyed by China's currency would be difficult, and possible U.S. countervailing measures against China over its currency could be challenged in the WTO. Many critics believe that undervaluing the yuan is a major factor affecting the price of Chinese exports to the United States, harming U.S. industries. Some proposed legislation would require factoring in the impact of misaligned currencies on export prices when determining antidumping duties, but critics question the feasibility and compatibility with WTO rules. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws related to China's WTO accession is another option. The United States can use safeguard provisions to restrict Chinese imports causing market disruption. The Bush Administration limited textile and apparel exports from China in 2005. Legislation like H.R. 782 and S. 796 may consider China's exchange rate misalignment in trade decisions. Legislation like S. 796 would require considering China's exchange rate misalignment in trade decisions. Policy analysts caution against pressuring China too hard on its currency policy, suggesting a more comprehensive approach to address trade issues. U.S. officials advocate for China to increase domestic consumption and adopt a more flexible currency policy to address global trade imbalances. Compliance with WTO commitments, particularly in market access and intellectual property protection, is a key focus of U.S. trade policy towards China. The United States faces challenges with China related to market access, intellectual property rights protection, industrial policies favoring domestic content, and indirect subsidization of Chinese state-owned enterprises. The U.S. believes it can leverage China's WTO commitments to push for economic liberalization and market opening. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential for it to be used as a political tool. Chinese government think tanks suggested that China could make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries if the U.S. imposed trade sanctions for a yuan revaluation. This raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, prompting Senator Charles Grassley to seek clarification from the Chinese government. The Chinese ambassador reassured that China had no plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves structure and emphasized China's responsible investment approach. China's move to liquidate dollar-denominated assets would impact the dollar's value in currency markets, but it's unlikely. It could lead to yuan appreciation, capital loss for China, and lower U.S. asset value. This might reduce U.S. economic growth and demand for imports from China. China established the China Investment Corporation in 2007 to manage foreign reserves, potentially diversifying away from Treasury securities. If China allows its currency to be determined by market forces, the yuan could appreciate, boosting U.S. exports and reducing the trade deficit. However, this would lead to higher U.S. interest rates as China would no longer purchase U.S. assets to maintain the peg. This could result in reduced investment spending and economic growth in the U.S. Some analysts fear that a sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could destabilize the U.S. economy amidst the falling dollar. A rise in the value of the yuan could lead to higher import prices and inflationary pressures in the United States. Moving to a floating exchange rate could reverse these effects, but China's capital controls prevent this due to fears of a large private capital outflow. Citizens fear for their deposits in the state banking system, worrying about insolvency. A large capital outflow could lead to a depreciating exchange rate, impacting U.S. exporters and increasing the trade deficit. China may consider floating its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls. Another option is to maintain the status quo, allowing the real exchange rate to adjust over time. The real exchange rate would adjust as inflation rates diverged between the two countries, causing the U.S. trade deficit to decline. However, this adjustment would take time, and pressures on the U.S. trade sector would persist. China's high saving rate and the U.S.'s low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Even with a floating exchange rate, persistent trade imbalances can occur at the bilateral level. If China continues with low-cost labor and productivity gains, its exports to the U.S. are likely to grow regardless of the exchange rate regime. The significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not reduced the U.S. trade deficit with China. The debate over China's currency policy is linked to concerns over the trade deficit, decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. Economists believe the yuan would appreciate against the dollar if allowed to float, but the trade deficit has not fallen in response to past appreciation. There is debate over the potential effects of a yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit with China has not been reduced despite the significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005. Various factors affect manufacturing employment in the U.S., including trade with China, increased productivity growth, and shifts to the service sector. It is unclear if production has shifted to China from the U.S. or other low-wage countries. Foreign multinational corporations play a significant role in China's manufactured exports, complicating the issue of who benefits from China's trade. The effects of an appreciating yuan and concerns about the falling dollar also impact the U.S. economy. China's accumulation of U.S. assets is affecting the value of the dollar, leading to debates on policy options to promote U.S. economic interests. Chinese officials plan to make the currency more flexible in the short term and eventually adopt a floating currency in the long run. However, gradual reforms are preferred to avoid disruptions to the economy, such as implementing further banking system reforms and reducing non-performing loans. The current currency policy may be expanding the money supply, potentially leading to easy credit policies and more non-performing loans. The Chinese economy's reliance on government directives rather than market forces is hindering the establishment of a market-based financial system. China's currency policy, seen as a subsidy, benefits some export industries but hampers resource distribution. US officials criticize China's cautious exchange rate reforms, which they believe are impeding global trade balance adjustments and could harm world economic growth. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms in China to boost domestic consumption and achieve more balanced growth. China officials aim to boost economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, healthcare, and education. Legislation in the 110th Congress focuses on China's currency policy, with bills requiring the Treasury Department to determine if China manipulates its currency and imposing tariffs if manipulation is found. Additionally, there are calls for the US to file a WTO case against China over its currency policy and to modify rules on currency manipulation. Another bill would apply US countervailing laws to products imported from non-market economies like China. Legislation in the 110th Congress focuses on China's currency policy, with bills requiring the Treasury Department to determine if China manipulates its currency and imposing tariffs if manipulation is found. Bills also make exchange rate misalignment actionable under U.S. countervailing law, prohibit the Department of Defense from purchasing certain products imported from China if currency misalignment disrupts U.S. defense industries, and include currency misalignment as a factor in determining safeguard measures on imports of Chinese products causing market disruption. H.R. 1002 imposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless China stops manipulating its currency, while H.R. 2942 applies countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and requires Treasury to identify misaligned currencies for priority action. Consultations failing to resolve currency issues would lead to USTR action in the WTO. S. 364 would also address currency issues. Legislation in the 110th Congress focuses on addressing currency manipulation, with bills requiring the Treasury Department to identify misaligned currencies and take action if necessary. This includes imposing tariffs, banning federal procurement from countries with misaligned currencies, and potentially filing cases in the WTO. The bills aim to hold countries accountable for currency manipulation and protect U.S. industries from unfair trade practices. Several bills in the 110th Congress address currency manipulation, requiring the Treasury Department to identify countries manipulating their currencies and take action, including imposing tariffs and consulting with the IMF. One bill, S.Amdt. 309, proposed a tariff on Chinese goods if their currency was not appreciating. The Senate failed to pass the amendment. The Senate considered bill S. 295, related to currency manipulation by China. Senator Schumer pushed for its consideration after disappointment over China's currency reforms. The bill was delayed multiple times based on assessments of China's currency policy. Senator Schumer eventually requested the Senate to take up S. 295 due to China's lack of progress on currency flexibility. On September 28, 2006, Senators Schumer and Graham announced they would not pursue a vote on S. 295 to give Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson more time to negotiate with China on its currency policy. H.R. 3283 would apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and require the Treasury Department to define \"currency manipulation.\" A similar bill, S. 1421, was introduced in the Senate."
