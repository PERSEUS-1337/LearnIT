    "content": "The rate of long-term economic growth is a key measure of a nation's ability to improve its material living standard. GDP per person today is significantly higher than in 1895, with a wider range of products available. Economic growth has also led to changes in occupations, transportation, education, and leisure time. The pace of long-term economic growth is crucial as the U.S. economy faces large generational income transfers for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Faster growth leads to a larger economic pie for these transfers, easing the burden on future workers. Concerns also arise from the U.S.'s significant foreign debt, which could reach $10 trillion, leading to annual debt service payments of $80 to $100 billion to foreign creditors. This could limit future output growth available for domestic consumers, impacting future living standards. Long-term economic growth is essential for future living standards, with even small differences in growth rates having significant impacts. A 3% annual growth rate can double the size of an economy in 24 years, leading to a per capita real GDP of about $75,000 compared to $59,000 with a 2% growth rate. This extra $16,000 allows for a broader range of economic choices and goals to be achieved with less sacrifice. Despite its importance, long-term growth is often not a focus of economic policy. Policies such as tax, labor market, science, technology, education, budget, legal, and regulatory policies can impact economic growth and future income. Understanding the determinants of long-term growth, correcting market failures, and implementing effective economic policies are crucial for achieving optimal living standards. Long-term growth involves increasing productive capacity, different from short-term economic changes. The long-term goal of economic policy is to steadily increase potential output, focusing on per capita output growth for a higher standard of living. Different policies such as monetary and fiscal policies can stimulate short-term economic growth, but may not impact the rate at which potential output expands. The growth of potential output, or aggregate supply, is the main concern of this report. Increasing real GDP per capita is crucial for a higher standard of living. However, simply increasing the labor force or average hours worked has limitations. Instead, sustained long-term growth requires a focus on efficiency and productivity. This is essential for achieving a rising standard of living. The standard measure of economic growth, real GDP per capita, may not accurately reflect changes in economic welfare. Factors like leisure time, child rearing, and volunteer work contribute to well-being but are not captured in GDP. Negative aspects like environmental damage or income inequality can harm well-being without affecting GDP. While GDP growth doesn't guarantee a higher living standard, it provides the potential for greater well-being. A higher living standard is not guaranteed by GDP growth, but it offers the potential for greater well-being by reducing tradeoffs in economic life. Society aims for optimal growth, not maximum growth, as faster growth may require diverting resources from current consumption to future growth. Optimal growth balances current and future consumption levels. Sustained economic growth is a recent historical phenomenon, with evidence of significant increases in living standards since 1800. Output per capita in industrializing economies grew at an average rate of 1.0% per year between 1800 and 1900, and accelerated to about 2.0% between 1900 and 2000. This growth, though modest, marked a sharp break from centuries of stagnation and poverty. Over the last 100 years, economic growth rates among industrial nations have been fairly clustered around a 2.0% pace. Japan had the highest growth at 2.7%, while Great Britain had the lowest at 1.4%. In the 25-year period from 1980-2004, growth rates among major economies became tighter, with the UK growing fastest at 2.3%, Japan slowing to 2.0%, and the US accelerating to 2.0%. European economies grew relatively slower at 1.6% on average. This convergence in growth paths has led to only slight differences in average growth rates of per-capita output. Over the long term, small differences in average growth rates of per-capita output can lead to significant variations in nations' material standard of living. The United States has shown steady growth in real GDP per capita over the past 125 years, with some short-term variability due to the business cycle. Medium-term variability has also been observed, with growth decelerating during the 1929-1950 period and accelerating from 1950 to 1973. The United States experienced a strong economic rebound after WWII, with a notable slowdown in per-capita GDP growth from 1973 to 1995. This deceleration was not due to slack demand but rather a slower expansion of the economy's productive capacity. The reasons for this significant slowdown remain largely unknown. However, since 1995, the U.S. economy has seen accelerated growth, reaching a pace of 2.3%, above the long-term trend. This growth was driven by the economic boom of the late 1990s, although there was a slight dip in growth due to the 2001 recession. Despite these fluctuations, the rate of U.S. long-term growth has shown limited variability over a long period. The variability of U.S. long-term growth over time suggests that it may be influenced by forces beyond typical economic variables. While medium-term variability allows for some influence through economic policy, understanding the determinants of long-term growth can help accelerate economic growth by increasing worker productivity. Factors such as physical capital, human capital, and technological knowledge play critical roles in increasing productivity and sustaining long-term growth. Other factors like laws, government policies, and institutions indirectly contribute to creating an environment that encourages economic behavior leading to growth. Providing workers with better tools, known as physical capital, enhances their productivity. This process, called capital deepening, requires diverting resources from current consumption to improve tools for workers. Investment in capital goods like factories and machines increases future production capacity by diverting resources from current consumption. This process, known as capital deepening, requires a deferral of current consumption for future gains. High rates of investment lead to faster economic growth by accumulating physical capital. Saving is necessary to support investment, and economies with high investment rates also tend to have high saving rates. Nations can borrow from other nations to support investment. In the long run, there is a strong correlation between domestic saving, investment, and economic growth. Countries with high saving and investment rates, like Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, have experienced high growth rates. Conversely, countries with low investment rates, such as Rwanda, Bangladesh, and India, have had low growth rates. The United States' investment rate has fallen in recent years, which may impact its economic growth. Most economists believe in a strong positive link between investment, capital deepening, and economic growth. Historically, only a small portion of U.S. economic growth was attributed to capital deepening. The standard theory of economic growth suggests that the impact of physical capital on long-term growth diminishes due to diminishing returns. While capital deepening can temporarily boost productivity and income levels, it cannot sustainably increase growth rates. The temporary acceleration of growth from capital deepening may stretch over many years, leaving the economy at a higher income level. Diminishing returns to capital explain why some economies grew faster than the U.S. Recovering from World War II or transitioning to industrial economies, countries with less existing capital saw greater productivity growth from investment. This resulted in faster-growing economies compared to the U.S. In recent years, research has shown that capital deepening plays a significant role in long-term economic growth, with estimates suggesting it contributes around 50% to the growth rate of the U.S. economy. This increase in the importance of physical capital is attributed to its impact on output and the complementarity effect with human capital. The importance of capital accumulation for economic growth lies in the complementarity effects between physical and human capital. New technology is best utilized when combined with new capital equipment and skilled workers. Additionally, advancements in human capital can occur through learning by doing with access to new technology. The accumulation of physical capital can also lead to further technical knowledge advancements, creating external benefits for subsequent investors. The adoption of new technology and subsequent investments can lead to significant economic benefits. For example, \"mass production\" was initially pioneered by a few firms but quickly adopted by others, resulting in widespread economic gains. Similarly, the integration of new information technology (IT) by a few firms can lead to reorganization and large investments, which are then replicated at a lower cost by competitors. This process can also lead to the development of derivative technological advances, as seen with the diffusion of electrical power in American industry. The diffusion of electrical power into American industry led to technological advances like the small electric motor. The correlation between investment in machinery and equipment, physical capital, human capital, and technological knowledge has implications for economic policy. Private investors may under-invest in acquired capital due to spillover benefits. Public policy can help achieve a better economic outcome. Human capital, defined as the knowledge and skills a worker brings to a job, can increase productivity. This can be achieved through education and on-the-job training. Human capital is different from technical knowledge, which is like books in a library, while human capital is the ability to understand and apply that knowledge. Investing in human capital can lead to better economic outcomes. The accumulation of human capital through investments in education and training can lead to increased worker productivity. This form of investment involves diverting resources towards the development of researchers, scientists, and engineers, similar to physical capital. The United States has made significant investments in human capital over the past 125 years, with a notable increase in educational attainment for the population. From 1875 to 1951, there was a rapid increase in educational attainment in the United States, reflecting the nation's commitment to mass education. However, the rate of increase slowed significantly in the following 24 years. The educational attainment of the labor force also saw a rapid gain from 1940 to 1980, followed by a substantial slowdown in the rate of increase. The educational attainment of the labor force in the United States saw a rapid gain from 1940 to 1980, with average years of schooling increasing from nine to 13.4 years. By 2000, only 11% had less than a high school education and 28% had a college degree. Increases in college education have been significant, contributing to the rise in educational attainment. However, the two decades since 1980 saw the slowest gains in educational attainment. Educational attainment directly contributed to the growth of per capita real output, but the indirect benefits on productivity are hard to calculate. The U.S. economy's human capital accumulation has been largely due to government-subsidized schooling, addressing market imperfections and financial constraints. Public education is essential for optimal human capital investment, as it generates external benefits like idea exchange and learning by doing. Additionally, investments in human capital complement physical capital in the production process. Investments in human capital have positive effects on physical capital investment. Private markets may underinvest in education, leading to potential market failure. Concerns arise over the slowing growth of educational attainment impacting long-term economic growth in the U.S. Evidence suggests that corrective public policy initiatives in education can boost economic growth. Advancing technological knowledge drives long-term economic growth by improving productivity and sustaining growth. The debate among economists revolves around the size of its contribution, not its importance in sustaining growth. Advancing knowledge is crucial for long-term economic growth, with technical progress accounting for a significant portion of output per labor hour. This progress is influenced by factors such as science, demographics, cultural attitudes, and socio-economic institutions. These determinants play a key role in driving technical progress and sustaining long-term growth. Recent research has shown that economic growth is influenced by the accumulation of physical and human capital, reducing the estimated contribution of technological knowledge. However, technological progress still accounts for 40% to 50% of real GDP per worker hour growth. New models, categorized as endogenous growth theories, explain technical progress as a result of purposeful economic behavior, influenced by risk, reward, and potentially economic policy. Endogenous growth theories have provided a more realistic understanding of accumulating technical knowledge, which contributes to sustained economic growth. Investing in adding to the stock of productive knowledge involves channeling scarce resources away from current production. This investment in technological advancement is driven by the prospect of future gains exceeding the opportunity costs. Investing in adding to the stock of productive knowledge involves channeling scarce resources away from current production. Measuring the stock of technological knowledge is challenging, but factors like changes in the number of scientists and engineers, R&D spending, and new patents can indicate investment in technical knowledge. The United States has shown a rising commitment to creating technical knowledge, with a significant increase in the number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D from 1950 to 1990. The United States has shown a rising commitment to creating technical knowledge, with a significant increase in the number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D from 1950 to 1990. R&D expenditures have also steadily increased, reaching $312 billion in 2004. However, R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP have fluctuated around 2.5%, indicating a steady intensity of research efforts not in line with economic growth. The source of funding for R&D has shifted towards industry, with implications for the type of research being funded and the social return on investment. The nature of translating resource inputs into knowledge creation and output growth is not fully understood, making economic evaluation imprecise. While there is a positive relationship between R&D investment and technical knowledge advancement, the exact transformation process is unknown. Knowledge creation faces market bias, hindering sufficient investment. Generating new ideas drives technological progress, with the market economy fostering innovation. Ideas are non-rival and often have limited exclusivity, allowing for widespread use. The limited excludability of ideas causes a divergence between private and social benefits, leading to undervaluation of R&D projects by private investors. Government support may be necessary for optimal scale of technical knowledge creation. Accumulation of capital and knowledge drive economic growth, but alone are insufficient for sustained improvement in economic well-being. The infrastructure for growth, consisting of laws, government policies, institutions, and cultural attitudes conducive to entrepreneurial activity, plays a critical role in sustaining long-term economic growth. Economic history shows how China's failure to sustain growth in the Ming dynasty led to economic stagnation, while Western Europe initiated the industrial revolution. The emergence of a lack of institutional support for enterprising behavior in the Ming dynasty hindered economic growth. Argentina's decline in per-capita income by the end of the 20th century was attributed to government policies discouraging investment. In contrast, post-World War II Japan's growth was fueled by a favorable interaction of capital, knowledge accumulation, and growth-enabling infrastructure. After World War II, Japan implemented significant institutional reforms that greatly improved its economic growth infrastructure. This led to a dramatic acceleration in Japanese economic growth over the next 40 years, surpassing that of the United States and increasing Japan's per-capita income to nearly 70% of the U.S. level. Other East Asian economies like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong have also benefited from a well-conceived \"growth infrastructure\" for long-term growth, with markets playing a central role in facilitating economic decisions and distribution of goods. The role of markets as an efficient information system in directing economic decisions is highlighted, contrasting with the inefficiency of non-market economies like the former Soviet Union. The influence of government on an economy's growth infrastructure and long-term economic growth is discussed, emphasizing the importance of well-conceived policies for success. Many economic historians believe that government infrastructure encouraging production and investment leads to economic growth, while government diversion hinders it. Investors need confidence that their returns won't be diverted by corruption. Property rights, including intellectual property, are crucial for economic transactions. Laws like patents and copyrights help align private and social returns, promoting idea creation and growth. Modern government can contribute to economic growth by pursuing macroeconomic stability, which can help minimize the negative effects of inflation, recession, and depression on investment and economic activity. Market failures can occur at both the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels, leading to the mispricing of factors of production such as physical capital, human capital, and technological knowledge. In such cases, the social benefit of investment may exceed the private benefit, highlighting the importance of government intervention in ensuring efficient resource allocation. Government intervention is crucial in correcting market failures that lead to under allocation of resources in certain endeavors. However, accurately targeting the source of market failure and gauging the extent of under allocation can be challenging due to the complexity of large market systems. Poorly calibrated government policies to correct market failures may result in costly distortions in other areas. In addition to promoting economic growth, government tasks such as taxation, regulation, legal system operation, social safety-net programs, and national defense also have economic repercussions. Government intervention in correcting market failures through tasks such as taxation, regulation, legal system operation, social safety-net programs, and national defense can divert resources from investment and economic growth. Depletion of natural resources may limit economic growth, but economists view it as unlikely due to steady discovery of new reserves. Despite strong economic growth, most commodity prices have not risen, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. The discovery of new reserves of natural resources may not be a reliable solution to resource scarcity in the long term. Advances in technical knowledge have led to innovations that reduce the need for scarce commodities, such as plastic replacing tin and fiber optic cable replacing copper. Market incentives drive these advancements, with economic incentives leading to the development of more cost-effective alternatives as resources become scarcer. Economies of scale also help counter the rising scarcity of exhaustible resources. Economies of scale play a significant role in countering the rising scarcity of exhaustible resources by reducing resource intensity as output increases. This leads to a slower depletion of commodity supplies. Markets can also anticipate future resource needs and efficiently allocate resources between the present and the future. While there is uncertainty in predicting the future, market mechanisms can help address resource scarcity, although government intervention may be necessary in cases of market failure. Government intervention may not always be better at predicting future resource needs, even though understanding long-term economic growth doesn't mean economic policy should influence it. Market mechanisms are generally effective in determining investment rates in physical and human capital, but market failure can occur when prices don't reflect the true economic value. In such cases, economic policy can potentially improve market outcomes and enhance economic welfare. It's crucial to differentiate between the economic and policy relevance of market failures when considering intervention to address them. Economic analysis may show significant market failures, but correcting them may not be straightforward. The potential for economic policy to correct market failures and accelerate economic growth is highlighted. However, crafting effective policies without causing inefficiencies or distortions poses challenges due to incomplete information about the extent of market failures. Despite the temporary nature of growth acceleration in physical and human capital, significant permanent benefits can still be achieved. The production of new ideas, or \"technical knowledge,\" is seen as the engine of long-term economic growth. There is debate over the factors influencing the rate of technical knowledge advancement and its relationship to economic policy. Some argue for increased R&D investment, while others point to historical stability in long-term GDP growth despite changes in economic circumstances. The United States has never had a well-defined long-term growth policy, with the 1950s and 1960s being the closest approximation. During this period, there was a high investment in physical and human capital, as well as technical knowledge, leading to above-trend economic growth. Government support for R&D spending and higher education, along with periodic tax incentives for businesses, contributed to this growth. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States focused on high investment in physical and human capital, technical knowledge, and R&D spending. Government support and tax incentives for businesses contributed to above-trend economic growth. The low saving rate in the U.S. economy has been a concern, with a decline from 18.3% in 1998 to 13.5% in 2005, compared to other advanced economies with saving rates in the 20% to 25% range. The saving rate in the United States has been declining, with the government saving rate dropping significantly due to budget deficits. The household saving rate has also fallen sharply, attributed to factors such as increased wealth from investments and government outlays. Various theories attempt to explain this phenomenon, but no single theory fully accounts for it. The decline in the household saving rate in the United States is a complex issue with various factors at play. Some believe it is a result of optimizing behavior by households, while others suggest it may be due to imprudent rise in economic impatience or myopia. Economists are unable to definitively determine if the low saving rate is optimal or suboptimal at this time. The debate on raising the household saving rate in the U.S. focuses on the impact of the tax system, including high tax rates on interest income and inheritance tax. Proposals include expanding tax-deferred savings plans like IRAs and shifting to a consumption-based tax system to incentivize saving. Critics argue that these changes may disproportionately benefit higher income households. Critics of private saving incentive policies raise doubts about their effectiveness in increasing total saving. They argue that raising the after-tax rate of return may not significantly boost private saving due to the inelasticity of saving behavior. Additionally, the incentives may have conflicting impacts on saving behavior, with a substitution effect increasing saving and an income effect reducing the need to save. Studies suggest that these effects may balance out, casting doubt on the overall impact of such policies on total saving. Private saving incentive programs may have little net effect on the saving rate due to conflicting impacts on saving behavior. Tax breaks for private saving may reduce public saving, but policies that move the government budget towards surpluses can raise both public and total saving. Increasing public saving typically leads to an increase in total saving, although not one-for-one. The current low public saving rate eliminates the need to optimize behavior for household saving. The state of budget balance reflects policy decisions influenced by social, political, and economic factors. Economists suggest raising public saving to boost investment and economic growth. Market failures in private investment could be addressed through government policies, but it is complex. Tax system structure can impact investment decisions. The tax system can influence investment decisions and economic growth. Pro-investment policies may include faster depreciation rates, investment tax credits, and changes in tax treatment of capital gains. Economists argue that the tax system should not discourage investment but should remain neutral in its effect on economic behavior, unless there is a market failure. The daunting information requirements for implementing an efficient investment tax incentive policy may cause distortions in investment patterns and resource allocation, leading to decreased economic efficiency and welfare. Running budget deficits can disincentivize private investment, while government surpluses can stimulate investment in physical capital. The government's active role in supporting education is crucial. The US government plays a significant role in supporting education, from elementary to higher education. The decline in educational attainment since 1980 is a concern for economic growth. The economic literature on education policy and human capital accumulation is vast, with areas offering high rates of return for increased resource allocation to improve economic efficiency and social well-being. The decrease in average educational attainment of the U.S. labor force since 1980 has led to a rise in the college wage premium, indicating an under allocation of resources to higher education. Financial constraints hinder low to moderate income youths from pursuing college degrees, suggesting the need for policies that increase opportunities for financial aid. Additionally, expanding programs to improve early childhood education for children from low-income families could yield significant social and economic returns. Good educational outcomes depend on early childhood development and the enhancement of non-cognitive skills. Access to quality education for low-income families is constrained by housing mobility. Advancing technical knowledge is crucial for long-term economic growth. Advancing technical knowledge is essential for long-term economic growth. Economists argue that purposeful behavior, driven by factors like greed, ambition, curiosity, or altruism, is more likely to lead to innovation in a conducive economic environment. Market-determined outcomes, such as risk and reward, play a significant role in influencing this behavior. However, private markets may not allocate resources optimally for creating new technical knowledge, leading to a potential market failure. Government intervention may be necessary to ensure an optimal level of investment in research and development, which is closely linked to the development of technical knowledge. Firms may underinvest in R&D despite high social returns. Economic policy can incentivize firms to increase R&D spending. The patent system aims to encourage innovation but raises questions about its impact on R&D and economic welfare. There is a trade-off with patents inducing more R&D but also leading to higher prices for consumers. Some economists argue that the current patent system may be out of balance, giving too much weight to inventors' rights and not enough to wider society. Concerns also exist about the efficiency of the patent system in inducing innovation and information transfer. While patents can aid in information transfer by requiring inventors to disclose details of their invention, there are worries that patents may hinder the accumulation of new knowledge in some cases. The patent system may hinder information transfer and innovation due to its focus on protecting inventors' rights. This can impede the flow of knowledge necessary for the development of subsequent generations of technology. The patent system may hinder innovation by creating overly broad patents, slowing down the dissemination of valuable knowledge. Government intervention to buy patents for societal benefit could be beneficial. Globalized markets require consideration of foreign patent systems for profitability. Improvements in international property rights could boost domestic R&D. R&D tax credits are another policy tool to incentivize research. The R&D tax credit allows a 20% tax credit on research expenditures to stimulate R&D spending by firms. However, economists doubt its effectiveness in targeting projects with large social benefits. Direct grants to firms for R&D projects with high social benefits may be more efficient, but the government may lack the information to operate such a program effectively. This could lead to inefficiencies and distortions in investment patterns. The pattern of investment and rent-seeking behavior can lead to inefficiency. Firms may not undertake high initial R&D investments unless they can charge prices above marginal cost. This pricing behavior violates efficient market outcomes and indicates monopoly power. Government anti-trust policies aim to prevent this, but taking action could hinder invention, innovation, and economic growth. Private firms may not pursue economically beneficial research despite government incentives. Basic research, funded by the government, is essential as it leads to significant economic benefits and produces unanticipated outcomes. Past examples include discoveries like DNA and penicillin. Government agencies like the National Science Foundation support basic research conducted at universities. The level of government funding for basic research is a key policy issue, as it is crucial for the accumulation of technical knowledge. Government funding for basic research has increased significantly over the years, reaching about $39 billion in 2004, with $21 billion allocated to universities and colleges. However, the intensity of government-funded basic research has decreased from 0.7% of GDP in 1953 to 0.2% in 2004. The correlation between government-funded basic research and economic growth is positive, but the exact impact is unclear, making it difficult to determine the optimal level of spending. Another issue is the distribution of funding across different scientific areas. Government funding for basic research has increased significantly over the years, reaching about $39 billion in 2004, with $21 billion allocated to universities and colleges. The share of government research spending in health related areas has risen steadily for the last 30 years and has increased dramatically over the last 10 years. Funding for life sciences now accounts for 60% of the government's basic research expenditures, while inflation-adjusted funding for basic research in the physical sciences has not risen over the last 30 years and accounts for only 10% of the government's budget for basic research. Some argue that this disparity in funding is inconsistent with the often interdisciplinary nature of major innovations, and is a movement away from the balanced basic research portfolio that is most likely to yield the maximum long-run return. The argument is for a more balanced increase across all areas of basic research to sustain long-term economic growth. Economic historians suggest that sustained economic growth requires a supportive infrastructure of laws, policies, and institutions that encourage production and economic transactions. Countries like the United States that have achieved long-term growth invest in physical and human capital, steadily raise productivity through technical knowledge advancement, and allocate a significant portion of income towards capital accumulation. The United States may under invest in economic growth determinants due to market failure. Government intervention could lead to an optimal increase in accumulation, accelerating economic growth. However, designing efficient economic policies to induce improvements is challenging due to information shortcomings. Policies aimed at increasing private investment and saving pose the greatest risk of generating more costs than benefits. The government's policies aim to increase private investment and saving by running budget surpluses. This incentivizes investment in physical capital through lower interest rates, while leaving specific investment decisions to individual firms. Government support for education programs has positively impacted economic growth, but concerns arise from declining educational attainment in younger generations. Efforts to improve access to higher education for minorities are recommended based on high economic returns. Policies to enhance early childhood education and improve access to higher education for minorities and low-income households may warrant more attention for long-term economic growth. Government support for research and development activities is crucial for generating new ideas, but concerns exist about the accuracy and scale of this support. Public funding for basic research, a key source of new ideas, has been decreasing and unevenly distributed across research disciplines, potentially hindering economic growth. The task of asking citizens to incur costs today for gains that will only fully accrue decades into the future is seen as thankless. Economic policies aimed at accelerating long-term growth may only boost the rate by a few tenths of a percentage point, but this can lead to a substantial improvement in national income 25 to 30 years from now. Policies that prioritize one growth determinant over others are unlikely to accelerate economic growth, such as reducing the budget deficit through cuts in education and research funding. Interdependencies of growth determinants suggest that a successful overall growth policy is crucial. A successful overall growth policy is most likely to occur by generating a balanced advance of investment in each determinant of economic growth to gain the fullest benefit from their complementary influence on each other."
