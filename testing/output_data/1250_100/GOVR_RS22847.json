    "content": "NATO held a summit in Bucharest, Romania in April 2008. The allies discussed stabilizing Afghanistan, admitting Croatia and Albania, and the dispute over Macedonia's name. President Bush's initiative to admit Georgia and Ukraine to the Membership Action Plan failed. The summit aimed to clarify NATO's mission, but no significant progress was made. Discussions on a new \"Strategic Concept\" were postponed until the following year, focusing on defense against terrorism, stabilization efforts, and peacekeeping. NATO faces challenges in defining its role and sharing the burden for security objectives. NATO's effort to stabilize Afghanistan is testing allied capabilities and political will. Some allies are hesitant to engage the Taliban directly, leading to criticism from countries like the United States, Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Approximately 42,000 troops and 25 Provincial Reconstruction Teams are in Afghanistan, focusing on rebuilding through infrastructure projects and governance improvements. The NATO summit focused on improving governance in Afghanistan, combating the narcotics trade, and enhancing relations with neighboring countries. Allies agreed on a strategic vision statement committing to an extended presence in Afghanistan, training Afghan officials, and pursuing a comprehensive approach to stabilization. Some countries pledged to send additional combat troops, while discussions also centered on countering emerging threats like cyber attacks. The NATO summit addressed cyber threats traced to Russian sources and discussed ways to counter them. Russia has disrupted energy supplies to various countries as a form of political intimidation. NATO continues to focus on energy security through conservation and alternative fuels. There is ongoing debate within NATO on missile defense, with the Bush Administration proposing a site in Poland. The Bush Administration proposed a missile defense site in Poland with interceptors and radar in the Czech Republic to defend against an Iranian missile threat. Russia believes the sites are aimed at their ballistic missiles. Public opinion in Poland and the Czech Republic opposes the sites. Warsaw wants resources to upgrade its air defense in case of attack. The US and Czech Republic signed an agreement for the radar site. NATO recognizes the threat of ballistic missile proliferation and the potential contribution of US missile defense assets. NATO is studying ballistic missile defense systems for protection of forces in the field. No final decision on system or funding. Critics question U.S. system's capability. Congressional hearing on European funding. Bucharest discussed NATO membership for Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia. Georgia and Ukraine seek Membership Action Plan. Candidate states lack significant military forces. The allies extended invitations to Croatia and Albania for NATO membership. Croatia has made improvements in governance and military modernization under its Membership Action Plan. Almost 60% of the Croatian population supports NATO membership. Albania, a small and impoverished country, has modest military resources. Croatia could play a role in discussions to bring Serbia back into the fold of western-oriented European states. OSCE reports on Albania's recent elections detail a number of issues. Albania, a small country with modest military resources, faces internal political tensions and doubts about the implementation of anti-corruption legislation. Despite recognizing Kosovo's independence and renouncing efforts to merge with it, Albania is in the process of professionalizing its military. NATO is preparing protocols for Albania's potential membership, with approval from all member states required for admission. The NATO Treaty amendment process requires approval from all member states for new state admissions. A dispute between Greece and Macedonia over the latter's name led to a block on Macedonia's application. The allies urged resolution of the dispute to allow Macedonia to begin accession talks. The Macedonian government fell after the summit, delaying progress. Discussions at Bucharest were contentious regarding admitting Georgia and Ukraine to the MAP.

At Bucharest, discussions were contentious regarding admitting Georgia and Ukraine to the MAP. U.S. State Department officials contended that only Germany opposed the MAP for the two governments due to concerns about a negative reaction in Moscow. However, interviews with allied government representatives revealed broader opposition, with France and at least two other governments wishing for a slower MAP process for Georgia and Ukraine. Several governments opposed the MAP but would not have blocked consensus. Ukraine's majority population opposes NATO membership, and some allies believe Kiev must first persuade its population of its value before starting the MAP process. Some allies believe Georgia must hold parliamentary elections in May and resolve conflicts before joining NATO. Criticism was raised against the Administration's handling of the MAP issue, with concerns about energy security and opposition to Georgia and Ukraine joining the MAP. The allies agreed that Georgia and Ukraine will become NATO members. The allies agreed that Georgia and Ukraine will become members of NATO, signaling confidence in their ability to qualify for membership and sending a message to Moscow. NATO conducted a bombing campaign in 1999 to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, leading to the establishment of a protectorate mission. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 after the implementation of a plan developed by U.N. envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The United States and a majority of EU countries recognized Kosovo's independence in 2008, opposed by Serbia and Russia. The US contributes troops to NATO's KFOR mission in Kosovo. The alliance aims to persuade Serbia to join the Euro-Atlantic community. France will assume the EU presidency in July 2008 and may focus on strengthening the Union's defense capabilities. Some governments proposed drafting a new Strategic Concept for NATO. The debate over a new Strategic Concept for NATO should wait until early next year due to the upcoming new Administration in Washington in January 2010."
