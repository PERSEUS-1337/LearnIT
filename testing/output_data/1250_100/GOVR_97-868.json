    "content": "The Internet is a network of interconnected networks linking millions of computers worldwide. Each computer has a unique IP number for communication. Domain names provide a simpler way to access websites, with Top Level Domains indicating country codes or generic designations. The Domain Name System (DNS) maps addresses to domain names, coordinated by root servers. The Internet originated from DARPA's research funding for a military network. The Internet originated from DARPA's research funding for a military network. A civilian segment evolved with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other science agencies. Key entities like the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and NSF played roles in managing the DNS. NSF was responsible for nonmilitary domain name registration and signed a cooperative agreement with InterNic in 1993. Under this agreement, Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) was involved in managing network services, including domain name registration. The Internet evolved from DARPA's military network funding, with civilian support from NSF. NSF cooperated with InterNic in 1993, appointing NSI as the sole domain name registrar for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Criticism arose over NSI's control and trademark disputes in the .com domain. Concerns about IANA's legal foundation led to the IAHC proposing seven new gTLDs and the introduction of competition among registrars. This prompted actions both in the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. government created an interagency group to address domain name issues and assigned lead responsibility to the NTIA of the Department of Commerce. The White Paper endorsed a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses, ensuring stability, competition, and fair representation of the Internet community. Internet constituencies worldwide held meetings to decide on the management and administration of Internet names and addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was proposed and its bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce in 1998. An official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN in November 1998 to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector entity. The MOU was extended until 2006, outlining transition tasks for ICANN to address. NTIA, as the Administrator, outlined the U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing security and stability. The U.S. would continue authorizing changes to the root zone, recognizing governments' interests in managing their country code top-level domains. ICANN was identified as the appropriate technical manager, and discussions on Internet governance were encouraged. A Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN aimed to transition DNS coordination to the private sector, focusing on transparency and accountability. An Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN further solidified global technical coordination of the DNS by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability and transparency. ICANN, a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, CA, is committed to accountability, transparency, and promoting competition in the DNS. Governed by a Board of Directors advised by various Internet constituencies, ICANN operates under California nonprofit laws and is overseen by the California attorney general. The Board makes final policy decisions, consisting of 16 international members, with tax-exempt status granted by the federal government and California. ICANN, a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in Los Angeles, CA, is governed by a Board of Directors advised by various Internet constituencies. The Board consists of geographically diverse members, with a total budget of $159 million and a staff of 373 in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. The Department of Commerce oversees ICANN's activities and policies, with congressional committees providing oversight. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of the network architecture enabling the domain name system to function. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce established their relationship. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce initiated the transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government retains a role in DNS through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA, and VeriSign. An Affirmation of Commitments was signed in 2009 to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) succeeded the Memorandum of Understanding between DOC and ICANN and has no expiration date. There were disagreements among Internet stakeholders regarding DOC's control over ICANN after the JPA expiration in 2009. U.S. groups argued for continued oversight to prevent international control of DNS, while international entities believed ICANN was ready for privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress to acknowledge ICANN's progress in accountability and transparency. The NTIA sought public input on the JPA expiration between DOC and ICANN, highlighting areas needing improvement for increased confidence in ICANN. The House Committee held a hearing on the JPA expiration and related issues. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce urged the extension of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, proposing a \"permanent instrument\" to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and global stakeholders. This instrument would include periodic reviews of ICANN's performance, measures to maintain and improve accountability, implementation of new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, access to WHOIS information, and a commitment to remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States. ICANN, a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States, is committed to accountability and transparency under the Affirmation of Commitments (AoC). The AoC establishes review panels to evaluate ICANN governance, composed of various stakeholders including the Governmental Advisory Committee, Board of ICANN, Department of Commerce, and independent experts. These panels ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. The panel, jointly chaired by the GAC and ICANN, will review plans to enhance DNS operational stability, security, and global interoperability. It will also assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition and consumer trust. Additionally, the panel will review WHOIS policy effectiveness in meeting law enforcement needs and promoting consumer trust. The panel, jointly chaired by the GAC and ICANN, will review plans to enhance DNS operational stability, security, and global interoperability. It will also assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition and consumer trust. The panel's composition includes representatives from various organizations and experts. Recommendations for improving ICANN's transparency and accountability were adopted by the Board in 2011. The focus is now on implementing these recommendations for meaningful reform. A follow-up report with 12 new recommendations was presented to the Board in 2013. The second ATRT (ATRT2) presented 12 new recommendations to the Board in 2013, most of which stemmed from issues raised in the first ATRT report. Legal agreements authorize ICANN to manage DNS technical functions, including IP address allocation and root zone file editing. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes. The June 30, 2005, U.S. government principles aim to preserve the security of the Internet's domain name system. The U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system aim to preserve security and stability, maintaining its historic role in authorizing changes to the DNS root zone file. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly affect U.S. government authority over the DNS. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with a separation between policy development and implementation. The IANA contract specifies requirements for a U.S. owned firm, with oversight by NTIA. NTIA plans to transition its stewardship role to the global Internet community by September 30, 2015. NTIA plans to transition its stewardship role of the IANA contract to the global Internet community by September 30, 2015. ICANN is expected to collaborate with various stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition, ensuring broad community support and adherence to key principles outlined by NTIA. Supporters of the transition argue that by transferring its remaining authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community, the U.S. government will bolster its support for the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. They believe this will enable the United States to effectively oppose proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. Those opposed to the transition are concerned about the loss of NTIA's role as a necessary \"backstop\" in ensuring the security and stability of the Internet DNS. Critics express concerns about the potential risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through the transition to a new Internet governance mechanism that lacks U.S. government oversight. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to address these concerns. The DOTCOM Act, H.R. 4342, aims to prevent the NTIA from giving up control of the Internet domain name system until a report by the GAO is submitted to Congress. This report will analyze the pros and cons of the change, address national security concerns, and define the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet governance. The bill was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was later included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015. The House passed H.R. 4435, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, with an amendment by Shimkus. The bill included protections for the .mil domain and supported the separation of policymaking and root-zone management functions. The Senate's version, S. 2410, suggested transferring IANA functions to a global multi-stakeholder community with the President's confidence in safeguarding the .MIL domain. The Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, S. 2410, directed the Department of Defense to ensure the exclusive use of the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol address numbers for national security. The Act also urged DOD to maintain the Internet root zone servers' stewardship. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, signed into law on December 16, 2014, did not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and Internet Protocol address numbers, especially for national security purposes. It also highlights the importance of maintaining consensus-based decision making in the multi-stakeholder approach and ensuring transparent and efficient accountability processes for a free, open, and resilient Internet. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to sustain the stewardship of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. On May 8, 2014, the House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, which appropriates funds for DOC and NTIA. The bill report stated that the committee's recommendation for NTIA does not include any funds for the transition and expects NTIA to maintain the existing contract with ICANN throughout FY2015. An amendment was adopted on May 30, 2014, stating that no funds from the Act may be used to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. NTIA must report quarterly on the privatization process and inform the committee of any decisions regarding a successor contract. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds for relinquishing its responsibility over Internet domain name system functions until September 30, 2015. NTIA is directed to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any decisions related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. Additionally, NTIA must submit a report to Congress on potential recourse if the U.S. disagrees with decisions made. The legislation addressing the proposed transition includes H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, which aim to prohibit NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over Internet governance without meeting certain criteria. These bills were referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Additionally, a hearing was held by the House Judiciary Committee on April 10, 2014. The DOTCOM Act of 2015 reintroduced by Representative Shimkus in the 114th Congress aims to prevent NTIA from transferring responsibility over the Internet domain name system without a GAO report to Congress. The report will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the transfer, NTIA's criteria, transfer proposals, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and potential risks to the Internet domain name system. H.R. 805 and S.Res. 71 address Internet governance and the NTIA's proposed transition. S.Res. 71 aims to raise awareness about the transition process and the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. Testimony was heard from NTIA, ICANN, and others regarding the status of the transition. ICANN is working on a transition proposal for the IANA functions, with a focus on enhancing accountability. A steering group will oversee the process in an open and inclusive manner, with input from various stakeholders. A Coordination Group has been formed to prepare the transition proposal. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) is responsible for preparing a transition proposal for the IANA functions. It consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, selected by their respective communities. The ICG's mission is to coordinate the development of a proposal among the affected communities. Three proposals for the primary IANA functions are being developed by operational communities, with the goal of creating a single consolidated proposal. Domain Names proposal is in progress, while Number Resources proposal is being developed by the Consolidated RIR IANA Stewardship Proposal Team (CRISP Team). The RIRs and IETF submitted final proposals to the ICG in January 2015 for the numbering and protocol parameter functions. The domain name function proposal has faced delays, with the CWG-Stewardship group missing deadlines. Transitioning the domain name IANA function from ICANN to NTIA is complex and controversial. The main debate is whether a transition is necessary. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN itself should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability to ensure it remains accountable to Internet stakeholders post-IANA contract with the U.S. government. This includes strengthening existing accountability mechanisms and forming a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) to develop proposals for accountability enhancements. The CCWG-Accountability, consisting of 25 members and 141 participants, will make decisions by consensus. It is open to interested individuals as participants, with up to seven advisors providing independent advice. Work Stream 1 focuses on enhancing ICANN's accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeframe. The IANA Stewardship Transition may occur as early as September 30, 2015. Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics with a timeline extending beyond the transition. An accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. NTIA must approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to proceed. NTIA's role during the transition process is uncertain due to Congress prohibiting spending on relinquishing responsibilities. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling stated that appropriated funds will not be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. NTIA will actively monitor the transition process, participate in discussions with stakeholders, and provide regular updates to Congress. Administrator Strickling emphasized the importance of a transparent and accountable transition process for the IANA functions contract with ICANN. He urged the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models and ensure new organizational structures are accountable. NTIA also highlighted the need for stress testing in the accountability process to safeguard against future contingencies. The CWG-Stewardship group is urged to consider all transition proposal models and ensure new organizational structures are accountable. Stress testing in the accountability process is needed to safeguard against future contingencies. NTIA emphasizes the importance of a transparent and accountable transition process for the IANA functions contract with ICANN. NTIA states that both transition processes should remain in sync and a coordinated and complete transition plan is necessary. The timing for delivering a transition plan is aimed for the summer, with flexibility to extend the contract if needed. ICANN is an international organization due to the global nature of cyberspace and the Internet. ICANN is an international organization with a Board of Directors and constituency groups from around the world. The Governmental Advisory Committee provides advice on policy matters, but the ICANN Board is not obligated to follow it. There are calls for greater international involvement in Internet governance, with debates at the United Nations on the issue. The U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 calling for further internationalization of Internet governance. The report proposed creating a new global forum for Internet stakeholders and suggested models that could supplant ICANN or make it accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. The U.S. opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body, while the EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted its support towards a different approach. In September 2005, the EU shifted its support towards an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an Internet governance agreement announced on November 15, 2005. This agreement maintained ICANN and the United States' roles in the domain name system. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in December 2010 for another five years. Controversies surrounding the roll-out of new gTLDs and the addition of the .xxx TLD led to calls for increased government influence on ICANN policy decisions. Some governments, like the US, Canada, and the EU, support the current multistakeholder model but advocate for a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee. Other nations, such as Brazil, South Africa, and India, prefer a new Internet policy entity within the U.N. system. Russia and China proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion at the U.N. General Assembly. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012, convened by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs). The revised International Code of Conduct for Information Security promotes multilateral, transparent, and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms. The WCIT in Dubai aimed to update the ITRs, focusing on traditional telecommunications traffic. The US advocated for maintaining a multistakeholder model for Internet governance and opposed ITU's jurisdiction over the Internet. Concerns in Congress grew over potential intergovernmental control. A hearing on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet\" was held, and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to support multistakeholder governance. H.Con.Res. 127 and S.Con.Res. 50 express Congress's support for the multistakeholder model in Internet governance, advocating for a global Internet free from government control. The House passed H.Con.Res. 127 unanimously, while S.Con.Res. 50 was introduced in the Senate. S.Con.Res. 50 was passed by the Senate and the House unanimously in 2012, supporting the multistakeholder model in Internet governance. During the WCIT, a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was withdrawn, leading to the adoption of a nonbinding resolution promoting equal government roles in international Internet governance. The United States declined to sign the treaty at the WCIT in Dubai due to Resolution 3 and new ITR articles on spam and cybersecurity. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress monitoring and opposing any proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 was introduced to affirm the U.S. policy on Internet governance, similar to previous congressional resolutions. H.R. 1580 affirms the U.S. policy on Internet governance, emphasizing the importance of global multistakeholder cooperation. In October 2013, ICANN and other organizations called for strengthening mechanisms for Internet cooperation to prevent fragmentation and address surveillance concerns. They also agreed to accelerate the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The Montevideo Statement called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, promoting equal participation of all stakeholders, including governments. A meeting between ICANN and Brazil's President led to the announcement of the NETmundial summit in April 2014, focusing on Internet governance principles and the evolution of the governance ecosystem. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" endorsing the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The meeting outcome reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, endorsed the transition of the U.S. government's stewardship role of IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community, emphasized the importance of strengthening and expanding the mandate of the Internet Governance Forum, and highlighted human rights in the implementation of a free and open Internet. ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, composed of stakeholders from various sectors, which prepared a report on principles, frameworks, and challenges in Internet governance. Additionally, a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in partnership with the World Economic Forum and ICANN. The NETmundial Initiative, announced in partnership with the World Economic Forum and ICANN, aims to apply NETmundial Principles for effective Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Korea concluded successfully without expanding its role in Internet governance. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses. Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, such as country codes like .us, .uk, or .jp, and generic TLDs like .com, .org, or .gov. ICANN established eight gTLDs before allowing for new applications in 2000 and 2004, resulting in 22 current gTLDs. Some are restricted to specific organizations, while others are open for registration. The process for introducing new gTLDs involves commercial and non-profit organizations becoming ICANN-recognized registries. There has been ongoing debate on expanding the number of gTLDs, leading ICANN to develop rules for introducing an indefinite number of new gTLDs. ICANN approved the launch of a new gTLD program in 2011, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced into the domain name system. Applications were accepted from January to April 2012 with a fee of $185,000. The program faced controversy from trademark holders concerned about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their trademarks. Governments and law enforcement also expressed worries about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes across the new gTLDs. ICANN faced opposition from trademark holders and some parts of the U.S. government in 2011 regarding the new gTLD program. Despite concerns, ICANN defended the program, stating that it would offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, promote competition and innovation, and had undergone a seven-year policy development process. Ultimately, ICANN proceeded with the new gTLD expansion as planned. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications by June 13, 2012. The evaluation process for new gTLD applications is complex and can take 9 to 20 months. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the rules and procedures. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, and 894 gTLDs are currently in process. ICANN plans for future rounds of applications with changes to the process. Concerns exist about potential domain name abuse in new gTLD spaces. Policymakers have considered using domain names to protect children from inappropriate online content. In the 107th Congress, the Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 was enacted to create a kids-friendly top-level domain name (kids.us) for age-appropriate content. Legislation for an adult content top-level domain (such as .xxx) has also been considered in past Congresses, but no bills advanced. ICANN has repeatedly discussed allowing a generic top-level domain for adult content since 2000. ICANN announced negotiations with ICM Registry to operate a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, sparking controversy. The Department of Commerce and ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee requested more time to address concerns before final approval. The ICANN Board authorized continued negotiations in March 2006, but on May 10, 2006, the decision was still pending. On May 10, 2006, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 against accepting the proposed agreement with ICM Registry for a .xxx domain. In January 2007, a revised agreement was published for public comment, but on March 30, 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the .xxx domain due to reluctance in managing Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry in February 2010. The ICANN Board voted to allow ICM's .xxx application to move forward in June 2010. Next steps included due diligence, negotiations on a draft registry agreement, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. In December, the Board passed a resolution to enter into a registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx TLD, pending consultation with the GAC. The ICANN Board approved the .xxx registry agreement with ICM despite GAC objections in March 2011. The .xxx top-level domain became available in December 2011. Concerns about DNS vulnerabilities and the importance of DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) were highlighted. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been developed to protect against malicious attacks on the DNS by digitally signing DNS data. The NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC in the Internet's DNS infrastructure, including the root zone. Collaboration between NTIA, NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign led to the development of an interim approach for deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. The final stages of DNSSEC implementation in the root zone were announced, and the signed root zone became available in July 2010. DNSSEC must be voluntarily adopted by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to deploy it effectively and maximize protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. The debate over the accessibility of WHOIS database information continues, with privacy advocates calling for limitations while businesses, law enforcement, and the U.S. government argue for continued public access. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on WHOIS data display. The GNSO approved a narrow technical definition for displaying WHOIS information, favored by privacy advocates and opposed by intellectual property interests. In October 2007, the GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and rejected a proposal for third-party contact information. Currently, the GNSO is conducting extensive studies on WHOIS. In June 2011, ICANN initiated four separate studies on WHOIS recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee. The WHOIS policy review team, established by the Affirmation of Commitments, issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, including improving data accuracy and access. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of gTLD registration data collection and consider safeguards for data protection. An Expert Working Group recommended a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace the current WHOIS system. ICANN is developing next steps for implementation. Ownership and registration of domain names have raised intellectual property concerns since the domain name system opened to commercial users. The White Paper called for WIPO to develop recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions, adopted by ICANN in August 1999. A dispute resolution policy was implemented for all ICANN-accredited registrars, with a special procedure for abusive registrations. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed by the 106th Congress, giving courts authority over domain name disputes. The authority can order forfeiture, cancellation, and transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith\" similar to trademarks, with civil damages of $1,000 to $100,000 per domain. Intellectual property is a key issue in debates over new generic top-level domain names by ICANN. Legislation like PROTECT IP and SOPA aim to prevent online piracy by restricting Internet traffic to infringing domain names. DNS decisions can impact policy issues like intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, and e-commerce. Decisions made by ICANN on issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity affect stakeholders globally. The key policy question is how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair representation of the global Internet community. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have led to calls for increased governmental influence in ICANN policymaking, while defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for maintaining the current process. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transitioning of its authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will evaluate if the transition is in the best interest of the United States and the Internet, monitoring the development of a stable, secure, and open DNS. Additionally, Congress will assess the potential for increased intergovernmental control over the Internet and the effectiveness of NTIA and other government agencies in addressing this issue. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transitioning of its authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will evaluate the potential for increased intergovernmental control over the Internet and the effectiveness of government agencies in addressing this issue, which could impact the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
