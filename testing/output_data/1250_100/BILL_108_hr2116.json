    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that operated from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining created large amounts of waste tailings and was located on flood-prone land. Mining at the site played a significant role in the nation's wartime consumption of lead and zinc during World War I. In 1923, the Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling chat aboveground at the Tar Creek Superfund Site for later reprocessing. During World War II, this recommendation was reiterated. In 1960, Congress passed a law to encourage lead and zinc production at the site. As mining declined in the 1970s, underground mine workings began to fill with water, leading to the formation of acid mine water that started discharging in 1979. The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1983, and the Environmental Protection Agency began remediation efforts in 1984. The Tar Creek Superfund Site has millions of tons of chat scarred on the surface, laced with toxic heavy metals like lead. The stockpiled chat contributes to flood problems and recharges underground mine workings. It has been used for construction purposes in various high-access areas. The use of chat in construction at the Tar Creek Superfund Site has led to heavy metal contamination, particularly with lead. The Environmental Protection Agency started remediation efforts in 1994 due to unsafe lead levels in residential yards. Studies show elevated blood lead levels in children at the site, which can result in learning disabilities and other health issues. Dust from the stockpiled chat is also a health concern. Additionally, underground cavities from mining have caused cave-ins, some exceeding 100 feet in diameter, in populated areas and near schools. No government agency has addressed the remediation of the stockpiled chat. The United States Government is responsible for remediating the stockpiled chat and subsidence dangers at the Site. No comprehensive epidemiological studies have been conducted at the Site, which can never be made safe for human habitation due to its unique environmental problems. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will work towards a comprehensive resolution for the environmental and health issues in the area."
