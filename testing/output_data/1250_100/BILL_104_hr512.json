The maximum capital gains rate for taxpayers with a net capital gain is amended to not exceed a certain sum based on qualified gains and taxable income thresholds. The tax law specifies different rates for net capital gains based on qualified gains and taxable income thresholds. The calculation involves determining the 3-year and 6-year qualified gains to determine the applicable rate. The term '6-year qualified gain' is defined as the excess of net capital gain over 3-year qualified gain or the net capital gain from the sale of qualified manufacturer's stock held for at least 6 years. Qualified manufacturer's stock refers to stock of a domestic C corporation involved in manufacturing. The 'post-1994 holding period' is the period after December 31, 1994. The subsection applies to pass-thru entities like regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds. Technical amendments include defining the 'applicable percentage' as the tax rate divided by the amount of gain. The applicable percentage for pass-thru entities is determined by dividing the tax rate imposed by specific sections. Amendments replace fixed percentages with the rate of tax determined under those sections. REDUCTION IN CORPORATE CAPITAL GAINS RATE ON STOCK OF DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS.

SEC. 1022 introduces indexing of qualified manufacturer's stock for determining gain or loss in the Internal Revenue Code. The indexed basis of qualified manufacturer's stock held for more than 3 years is substituted for its adjusted basis upon sale or disposal. Qualified manufacturer's stock is defined as stock of a domestic C corporation engaged in manufacturing and held as a capital asset. The indexed basis is calculated by multiplying the adjusted basis of the stock by the applicable inflation ratio. The applicable inflation ratio for any stock is determined by dividing the gross domestic product deflator for the quarter of disposition by the deflator for the quarter of acquisition. The ratio must not be less than 1 and is rounded to the nearest \\1/1000\\. Gross domestic product deflator is the implicit price deflator for the GDP. Regulated Investment Companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts have adjustments at the entity level under subsection (a). Adjustments under subsection (a) apply to qualified investment entities for determining earnings and profits. This section does not affect qualification for sections 851(b) and 856(c). Stock in a qualified investment entity is considered qualified manufacturer's stock based on its fair market value compared to all assets. If the ratio is 90 percent or more, it is treated as 100 percent. For a qualified investment entity, the ratio for a month will be 100 percent if it is above 10 percent, otherwise, it will be zero. Real estate investment trusts are not required to value assets more frequently than once every 36 months. Qualified investment entities include regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. Pass-through entities like partnerships, S corporations, and common trust funds pass adjustments made at their respective levels to partners, shareholders, and participants. The section does not apply to property dispositions between related persons unless the transferee's basis is substituted. Related persons are defined as those with relationships outlined in section 267(b). The section 267(b) outlines rules for transfers to increase indexing adjustments, including disallowing adjustments made for the purpose of securing or increasing an adjustment. Special rules include treating substantial contributions to capital as separate stock, adjusting the inflation ratio for periods of non-qualified manufacturer's stock, treating non-dividend distributions as dispositions, and determining acquisition dates. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section regarding acquisition dates of stock. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part II of subchapter O of chapter 1 of the Code. Sec. 1022 allows for indexing of qualified manufacturer's stock to determine gain or loss. The amendment also affects earnings and profits by substituting indexed basis for adjusted basis in the case of stock disposition. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994."
