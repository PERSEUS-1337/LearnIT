The Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to various species, including neotropical migratory birds like the Cerulean Warbler and the Wood Thrush, waterfowl such as the American Black Duck, and globally rare plants. Ongoing studies have shown high water quality in Cherry Creek. There is strong local support for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with public meetings demonstrating enthusiasm from area landowners, business leaders, and elected officials. Two federally-owned parcels of land, including the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a segment of the Appalachian Trail, are contiguous to the potential refuge area. Numerous local communities, conservation entities, and landowners in Cherry Valley are actively conserving wildlife habitat and farmland. Local entities, along with state agencies and the National Park Service, are potential partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Some landowners have already placed their land into conservation easements. Monroe County and Stroud Township in Pennsylvania have voter-approved funds for open space and land conservation. Pennsylvania's municipal land conservation fund has contributed to various projects in Cherry Valley, including conserving wildlife habitat and farmland. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
