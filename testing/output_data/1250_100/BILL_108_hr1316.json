    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\" is abbreviated as such. It includes findings related to pulmonary hypertension research. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder with a poor survival rate, affecting men and women of all ages and ethnicities. About 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the highest number in women aged 21-40. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) affects people of all racial and ethnic origins equally. The low prevalence of PPH makes studying the disease challenging, as there is no good animal model available. In advanced stages, patients have limited activity and symptoms even at rest, potentially leading to complete bedriddenness. PPH is often difficult to diagnose and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH patient registry in 1981, following 194 patients for up to 7.5 years. During 1996-1997, 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, leading to cases of PPH. Research is focused on immunologic and genetic factors, pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, smooth muscle growth, and scar tissue formation. SPH is caused by conditions like emphysema and bronchitis. Causes of pulmonary hypertension include disorders like emphysema, bronchitis, scleroderma, CREST syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital heart diseases, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Director of the Institute will expand research activities on pulmonary hypertension and coordinate with other national research institutes. Grants will be provided to public or nonprofit entities to establish centers for research, training, and education on pulmonary hypertension. The centers established for research on pulmonary hypertension will conduct basic and clinical research, training programs for scientists and health professionals, provide information to healthcare professionals, and disseminate information to the public. Stipends may be provided for professionals enrolled in training programs. The Director will coordinate the centers and provide reports as needed. The Director will coordinate the establishment of at least three centers for research on pulmonary hypertension, each supported for up to 5 years and potentially extended for additional periods after review by a scientific peer group. The centers will be organized using the facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. Regular communication and information coordination among the centers will be ensured, with reports on activities submitted to the Director. The Director of the Institute will establish a data system and clearinghouse for pulmonary hypertension information dissemination. Public input will be provided on existing and planned programs of the National Institutes of Health. The Director of the Institute will prepare biennial reports on activities related to primary hypertension and receive public comments. Up to $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004-2008 for this purpose."
