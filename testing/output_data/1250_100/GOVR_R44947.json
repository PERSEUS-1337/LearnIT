    "content": "Under Article III of the Constitution, Congress has the power to establish federal courts below the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created federal district and circuit courts, including the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) in 1789. The ATS was modified in 1873 and 1911 before its current version in 1948. The ATS aims to provide foreign plaintiffs a remedy for international law violations to maintain harmony in international relations. The United States faced challenges in meeting foreign affairs obligations before the Constitution was adopted. During the founding era, the Articles of Confederation limited the federal government's ability to address violations of international law. Only Connecticut passed legislation to penalize treaty infractions. The Framers and First Congress recognized the need for federal courts to handle cases involving foreign relations, such as those concerning foreign diplomats and maritime issues. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was included in jurisdictional provisions to allow federal courts to hear claims for violations of international law impacting U.S. foreign relations. In the 1780s, incidents involving foreign diplomats highlighted the need for a national judiciary to address conflicts in international relations under the Articles of Confederation. During the 1780s, incidents involving foreign diplomats underscored the need for a national judiciary to address conflicts in international relations under the Articles of Confederation. Longchamps was convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by a Pennsylvania court, but French requests for his extradition were denied. The United States faced challenges in providing judicial relief to foreign officials, leading to tensions with foreign ambassadors like Pieter J. Van Berckel. These incidents were considered serious breaches of international law and could potentially lead to war. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was rarely used for the first 190 years of its existence, with only two reported cases invoking it for jurisdiction. The first case involved a French captain seeking to recover slaves, while the second case was about forged passports in an international child custody dispute. The statute was described as old and underutilized by a federal judge. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was rarely used for the first 190 years until it gained prominence in 1980 with the Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case. The case involved Paraguayan citizens suing a former Inspector General for kidnapping, torture, and murder. The ATS provided jurisdiction for the case, marking a significant shift in the statute's application. The Fil\u00e1rtiga case established that torture by a state official against its own citizen violates international human rights law, making it actionable under the ATS. This decision led to the ATS becoming a prominent avenue for civil claims in U.S. federal courts for human rights violations occurring outside the United States. In Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, the D.C. Circuit addressed the question of whether the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) solely provides jurisdiction or also creates a cause of action for plaintiffs. The case involved Israeli citizens suing the Palestinian Liberation Organization for a terrorist attack. The judges unanimously dismissed the case, with Judge Bork arguing that the ATS is purely jurisdictional and does not allow for damages. In Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, the D.C. Circuit addressed whether the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) solely provides jurisdiction or also creates a cause of action for plaintiffs. Judge Bork argued that the ATS is purely jurisdictional and does not allow for damages, while Judge Edwards disagreed, stating that the ATS creates a statutory cause of action. The case was ultimately dismissed due to lack of official state action and insufficient recognition of terrorism as a violation of international law. Judge Robb found the case raised nonjusticiable political questions. This doctrinal disagreement over the cause-of-action question would later be addressed in the landmark Supreme Court decision, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, decided 20 years later. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, creating a civil cause of action for damages against individuals who subject others to torture or extrajudicial killing. The TVPA was designed to establish a clear basis for causes of action recognized in Fil\u00e1rtiga and to address the need for a separate grant of a private right of action. Contrary to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), the TVPA explicitly allows for civil actions for torture and extrajudicial killing and extends the cause of action to both U.S. and foreign nationals. The TVPA extends a cause of action to U.S. and foreign nationals for torture and extrajudicial killing, excluding liability against corporations. It requires plaintiffs to exhaust all remedies where the conduct occurred. The relationship between the TVPA and the ATS is unclear, with some courts viewing the TVPA as supplementing the ATS while others see it as occupying the field. The TVPA provides an express cause of action for claims previously argued under the ATS. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court addressed the cause-of-action question regarding the seizure of Mexican doctor Humberto Alvarez-Machain by DEA officials. The Court rejected Alvarez's arguments and found no grounds to dismiss the criminal case against him. The Supreme Court dismissed criminal charges against Alvarez for lack of evidence, leading him to file a civil case asserting ATS claims against his abductors. The Sosa Court clarified that the ATS is a jurisdictional statute and does not create new causes of action, emphasizing its original intent as part of the Judiciary Act. The Sosa Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) is a jurisdictional statute that allows federal courts to recognize a narrow set of common law causes of action for international law violations without the need for a separate statute. The Court identified specific offenses from 18th-century English criminal law that would have been actionable under the ATS at the time of its enactment, such as violations of safe conducts, infringement on the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. However, ATS jurisdiction is not limited to these claims. The Sosa Court clarified that under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), federal courts can recognize common law claims for violations of the \"present-day law of nations\" if they meet specific criteria. The Court emphasized the need for judicial caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action. Alvarez's claim for arbitrary arrest and detention was dismissed as it did not meet the newly described requirements for an ATS claim. Since Sosa, a majority of Justices have established a two-step framework for addressing questions related to the breadth of ATS liability. The ATS allows federal courts to recognize common law claims for violations of the \"present-day law of nations\" if specific criteria are met. Courts should exercise caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action. The post-Fil\u00e1rtiga movement of using the ATS for human rights abuses continued after Sosa, but slowed down after Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum imposed restrictions on the territorial reach of the ATS. In Kiobel, the Supreme Court addressed corporate liability under the ATS in a case involving Nigerian nationals suing oil companies for human rights abuses in Nigeria. The Kiobel Court, in a majority opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts, relied on the \"presumption against extraterritorial application\" to conclude that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not reach conduct that occurred entirely in the territory of a foreign nation. This presumption aims to avoid clashes between U.S. and foreign law and reflects Congress's focus on domestic concerns. Federal courts generally presume that statutes do not apply to claims arising in foreign territory unless there is a clear indication of extraterritorial application. The Kiobel Court applied the presumption against extraterritoriality to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), finding that claims must have a sufficient connection to the United States to displace this presumption. The Court held that the ATS was not intended to have extraterritorial reach, as demonstrated by historical events related to the statute. The Nigerian plaintiffs' claims for violations of the law of nations in Nigerian territory were therefore barred. The Court suggested that future ATS cases could displace the presumption if the claims \"touch and concern\" the United States with sufficient force. The Kiobel Court did not provide further explanation on how an ATS claim could satisfy the \"touch and concern\" test, leading to divergent interpretations in lower courts. Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito expressed the need for clarification on the reach and interpretation of the ATS in the future. Justice Alito proposed a broader standard for satisfying the \"touch and concern\" requirement, emphasizing that only domestic conduct violating the law of nations would sufficiently connect a claim to the United States. Justice Breyer disagreed with the majority's decision to dismiss the case, arguing that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) should not be limited by the presumption against extraterritoriality. He proposed a test for ATS jurisdiction based on factors such as the alleged tort occurring on American soil or the defendant being an American national. This would prevent the United States from becoming a safe harbor for torturers or common enemies of mankind. Justice Breyer disagreed with the majority's decision to dismiss the case, proposing a test for ATS jurisdiction based on factors like the alleged tort occurring on American soil or the defendant being an American national. This would prevent the US from becoming a safe harbor for violators of international norms. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel has limited the ATS as a vehicle for human rights abuses in US courts, particularly in \"foreign cubed\" cases. Different interpretative frameworks have created a split among circuits on what level of domestic conduct is necessary to satisfy Kiobel's \"touch and concern\" test. The Fifth and Second Circuits have adopted a bright-line approach similar to Justice Alito's concurrence in Kiobel, requiring the conduct violating the law of nations to have occurred in the United States to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. In contrast, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have developed flexible methods of interpretation, with the Fourth Circuit emphasizing a fact-based analysis that allows cases with extensive U.S. contacts and strong connections to the U.S. to proceed under the ATS. The Eleventh Circuit has held that an ATS claim satisfies the \"touch and concern test\" if it has a U.S. focus and relevant conduct occurs in the United States. Factors like defendants' citizenship and U.S. national interests are considered, but not enough to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. The Ninth Circuit also considers U.S. citizenship as a factor in establishing a connection to the U.S. Disparity among circuits stems from their interpretation of Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. The Supreme Court in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. held that the presumption against extraterritoriality defeated the plaintiffs' claim under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, as the focus is on the purchase and sale of securities, not the deceptive conduct. Application of Morrison's \"focus\" analysis in Alien Tort Statute (ATS) cases may make it harder for plaintiffs to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, with differing opinions among circuits on whether Morrison applies to the ATS. The Fifth and Second Circuits applied Morrison's \"focus\" analysis to their interpretations of Kiobel, adopting a bright line rule that plaintiffs can only displace the presumption against extraterritoriality in ATS cases if the violation of the law of nations occurred domestically. The Eleventh Circuit took a hybrid approach combining Kiobel's standards with Morrison's focus test. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community may help resolve the conflict by applying the presumption against extraterritoriality to RICO civil provisions. The Court explained a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues in Morrison and Kiobel. The Fifth and Second Circuits applied Morrison's \"focus\" analysis to ATS cases, creating a bright-line rule for displacing the presumption against extraterritoriality. The Eleventh Circuit took a hybrid approach. RJR Nabisco may streamline lower courts' frameworks for analyzing extraterritoriality under the ATS, potentially incorporating the \"focus\" test. However, disagreement may still arise on the precise \"focus\" of the ATS. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC may further restrict the use of the ATS in pursuing extraterritorial claims, particularly regarding corporate liability under the statute. The Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split on whether corporations can be held liable under the ATS. The Jesner case involved claims by foreign nationals injured by terrorist groups in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank aided terrorist organizations by maintaining accounts and compensating families of victims. The ATS claims were dismissed by the district court and Second Circuit based on prior circuit precedent. The Supreme Court in Jesner case upheld the Second Circuit's decision on corporate liability under the ATS, ruling that foreign corporations are not subject to liability. However, U.S. corporations could still face claims under the ATS. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, applied the two-part inquiry from Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain to evaluate violations of international norms under the ATS. The Supreme Court in Jesner case upheld the Second Circuit's decision on corporate liability under the ATS, ruling that foreign corporations are not subject to liability. The Court emphasized judicial caution in extending ATS liability to foreign corporations, citing separation-of-powers and foreign affairs concerns. The decision highlighted that Congress is better positioned to consider imposing ATS liability on foreign corporations, as such claims can impact U.S. foreign relations. The Jesner Court concluded that foreign corporations may not be defendants in suits brought under the ATS, citing separation-of-powers and foreign affairs concerns. Justices diverged in their rationale for the holding, with a majority agreeing to a categorical rule foreclosing ATS claims against foreign corporate entities. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas joined Justice Kennedy's opinion, while Justice Alito expressed that courts should decline ATS claims that do not advance the ATS's objective of avoiding diplomatic strife. Justice Gorsuch provided additional reasons for his belief in the Jesner decision. Justice Gorsuch and Justice Thomas both provided additional reasons for their belief in the Jesner decision. Gorsuch argued that separation-of-powers principles dictate that courts should not recognize new causes of action under the ATS, and that the statute was intended to apply only to claims against U.S. defendants. Thomas concurred with Justice Kennedy's opinion but also agreed with Justices Alito and Gorsuch. In dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that the corporate form itself does not raise foreign policy concerns that would require foreign corporations to be immune from liability under the ATS. She suggested that any friction in foreign affairs should be addressed through other limitations on ATS jurisdiction. The Jesner decision has sparked a debate on the future of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) as a tool for human rights abuse lawsuits. Some believe that with the limitations set by Jesner and Kiobel, very few cases will meet the Supreme Court's jurisdiction requirements. However, others argue that the ATS still holds significance as it allows suits against U.S. corporations and individual employees of foreign companies. The dissenters in Jesner suggested addressing foreign policy concerns through other limitations on ATS jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's potential limitation on ATS jurisdiction could restrict claims to piracy, interference with ambassadors' rights, and safe conduct violations. This could diminish the statute's significance, which emerged prominently after the Fil\u00e1rtiga case but has seen limitations set by the Supreme Court on viable ATS claims. The High Court has placed limitations on viable ATS claims through decisions in Sosa, Kiobel, and Jesner. Some view this as the end of the ATS's era of importance, while others see potential for limited cases against natural persons or U.S. corporate defendants. The Jesner Court emphasized the need for congressional action before expanding ATS jurisdiction, suggesting the future of ATS litigation may depend on legislative rather than judicial decisions."
