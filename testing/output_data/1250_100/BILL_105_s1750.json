    "content": "SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION REGARDING DRUG-PRODUCING AND DRUG-TRANSIT COUNTRIES. Additional Certification: Amending subsection (b)(1) of section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include criteria related to compliance with the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The text chunk discusses amendments made to section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, specifically related to compliance with the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Amendments include changes to subsections (b)(3), (c), and (f) to align with the Convention's requirements. The text chunk discusses additional requirements relating to qualified certification under section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It includes the establishment of a high-level contact group involving officials from the United States and the certified country in the event of a certification under subsection (b)(1)(B). The text chunk outlines the responsibilities of high-level contact groups in establishing specific benchmarks for countries to monitor progress under various plans and programs. Each benchmark should include measurable goals to objectively assess the country's progress. The high-level contact groups are tasked with setting specific benchmarks for countries, including goals related to arrests, extradition, eradication of drug-related crops, and money-laundering. These benchmarks must be completed within 60 days after certification, and an annual report must be submitted to Congress outlining the established benchmarks for each country. The President shall identify countries, set benchmarks, and report on progress made by each country. Benchmarks must be completed within 60 days, and progress reports submitted annually to Congress. The President will prioritize progress on benchmarks when making certifications for countries. In 1998, a high-level contact group should be convened for Mexico as per the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The provisions of the act should apply to the group's activities, and certification for Mexico in 1999 will follow the same provisions."
