Congress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, an old inhabited area, home to 6 pueblos, and a vital habitat for migratory birds. The area provides water to many in New Mexico and should be maintained to protect endangered species, the river flow, and be more accessible to the public. The Corps of Engineers should prioritize environmental restoration and reestablish hydrologic connections where possible.
